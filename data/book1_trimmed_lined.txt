409: EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION
410: 
411: 
412: There are not wanting indications that public interest in the Critical
413: Philosophy has been quickened of recent days in these countries, as
414: well as in America. To lighten the toil of penetrating through the
415: wilderness of Kant’s long sentences, the English student has now many
416: aids, which those who began their studies fifteen or twenty years
417: ago did not enjoy. Translations, paraphrases, criticisms, have been
418: published in considerable numbers; so that if it is not yet true that
419: “he who runs may read,” it may at least be said that a patient student
420: of ordinary industry and intelligence has his way made plain before
421: him. And yet the very number of aids is dangerous. Whatever may be the
422: value of short and easy handbooks in other departments of science,
423: it is certain that no man will become a philosopher, no man will
424: even acquire a satisfactory knowledge of the history of philosophy,
425: without personal and prolonged study of the _ipsissima verba_ of the
426: great masters of human thought. “Above all,” said Schopenhauer, “my
427: truth-seeking young friends, beware of letting our professors tell
428: you what is contained in the Critique of the Pure Reason”; and the
429: advice has not become less wholesome with the lapse of years. The fact,
430: however, that many persons have not sufficient familiarity with German
431: to enable them to study German Philosophy in the original with ease,
432: makes translations an educational necessity; and this translation of
433: Kant’s Critique of the faculty of Judgement has been undertaken in the
434: hope that it may promote a more general study of that masterpiece. If
435: any reader wishes to follow Schopenhauer’s advice, he has only to omit
436: the whole of this prefatory matter and proceed at once to the Author’s
437: laborious Introduction.
438: 
439: It is somewhat surprising that the Critique of Judgement has never
440: yet been made accessible to the English reader. Dr. Watson has indeed
441: translated a few selected passages, so also has Dr. Caird in his
442: valuable account of the Kantian philosophy, and I have found their
443: renderings of considerable service; but the space devoted by both
444: writers to the Critique of Judgement is very small in comparison
445: with that given to the Critiques of Pure and Practical Reason. And
446: yet the work is not an unimportant one. Kant himself regarded it as
447: the coping-stone of his critical edifice; it even formed the point
448: of departure for his successors, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, in the
449: construction of their respective systems. Possibly the reason of
450: its comparative neglect lies in its repulsive style. Kant was never
451: careful of style, and in his later years he became more and more
452: enthralled by those technicalities and refined distinctions which deter
453: so many from the Critical Philosophy even in its earlier sections.
454: These “symmetrical architectonic amusements,” as Schopenhauer called
455: them, encumber every page of Kant’s later writings, and they are a
456: constant source of embarrassment to his unhappy translator. For, as
457: every translator knows, no single word in one language exactly covers
458: any single word in another; and yet if Kant’s distinctions are to be
459: preserved it is necessary to select with more or less arbitrariness
460: English equivalents for German technical terms, and retain them all
461: through. Instances of this will be given later on; I only remark
462: here on the fact that Kant’s besetting sin of over-technicality is
463: especially conspicuous in this treatise.
464: 
465: Another fault--an old fault of Kant--apparent after reading even a few
466: pages, is that repetitions are very frequent of the same thought in but
467: slightly varied language. Arguments are repeated over and over again
468: until they become quite wearisome; and then when the reader’s attention
469: has flagged, and he is glancing cursorily down the page, some important
470: new point is introduced without emphasis, as if the author were really
471: anxious to keep his meaning to himself at all hazards. A book written
472: in such fashion rarely attracts a wide circle of readers. And yet, not
473: only did Goethe think highly of it, but it received a large measure
474: of attention in France as well as in Germany on its first appearance.
475: Originally published at Berlin in 1790, a Second Edition was called
476: for in 1793; and a French translation was made by Imhoff in 1796. Other
477: French versions are those by Keratry and Weyland in 1823, and by Barni
478: in 1846. This last I have had before me while performing my task, but
479: I have not found it of much service; the older French translations
480: I have not seen. The existence of these French versions, when taken
481: in connexion with the absence until very recently of any systematic
482: account of the Critique of Judgement in English, may be perhaps
483: explained by the lively interest that was taken on the Continent in the
484: Philosophy of Art in the early part of the century; whereas scientific
485: studies on this subject received little attention in England during the
486: same period.
487: 
488: The student of the Critique of Pure Reason will remember how closely,
489: in his Transcendental Logic, Kant follows the lines of the ordinary
490: logic of the schools. He finds his whole plan ready made for him, as
491: it were; and he proceeds to work out the metaphysical principles which
492: underlie the process of syllogistic reasoning. And as there are three
493: propositions in every syllogism, he points out that, in correspondence
494: with this triplicity, the higher faculties of the soul may be regarded
495: as threefold. The Understanding or the faculty of concepts gives us our
496: major premise, as it supplies us in the first instance with a general
497: notion. By means of the Judgement we see that a particular case comes
498: under the general rule, and by the Reason we draw our conclusion.
499: These, as three distinct movements in the process of reasoning,
500: are regarded by Kant as indicating three distinct faculties, with
501: which the Analytic of Concepts, the Analytic of Principles, and the
502: Dialectic are respectively concerned. The full significance of this
503: important classification does not seem, however, to have occurred
504: to Kant at the time, as we may see from the order in which he wrote
505: his great books.[1] The first problem which arrests the attention
506: of all modern philosophers is, of course, the problem of knowledge,
507: its conditions and its proper objects. And in the Critique of Pure
508: Reason this is discussed, and the conclusion is reached that nature
509: as phenomenon is the only object of which we can hope to acquire any
510: exact knowledge. But it is apparent that there are other problems which
511: merit consideration; a complete philosophy includes practice as well
512: as theory; it has to do not only with logic, but with life. And thus
513: the Critique of Practical Reason was written, in which is unfolded
514: the doctrine of man’s freedom standing in sharp contrast with the
515: necessity of natural law. Here, then, it seems at first sight as if we
516: had covered the whole field of human activity. For we have investigated
517: the sources of knowledge, and at the same time have pointed out the
518: conditions of practical life, and have seen that the laws of freedom
519: are just as true in their own sphere as are the laws of nature.
520: 
521: But as we reflect on our mental states we find that here no proper
522: account has been given of the phenomena of _feeling_, which play so
523: large a part in experience. And this Kant saw before he had proceeded
524: very far with the Critique of Practical Reason; and in consequence
525: he adopted a threefold classification of the higher mental faculties
526: based on that given by previous psychologists. Knowledge, feeling,
527: desire, these are the three ultimate modes of consciousness, of which
528: the second has not yet been described. And when we compare this with
529: the former triple division which we took up from the Aristotelian
530: logic, we see that the parallelism is significant. Understanding is
531: _par excellence_ the faculty of knowledge, and Reason the faculty of
532: desire (these points are developed in Kant’s first two Critiques). And
533: this suggests that the Judgement corresponds to the feeling of pleasure
534: and pain; it occupies a position intermediate between Understanding
535: and Reason, just as, roughly speaking, the feeling of pleasure is
536: intermediate between our perception of an object and our desire to
537: possess it.
538: 
539: And so the Critique of Judgement completes the whole undertaking
540: of criticism; its endeavour is to show that there are _a priori_
541: principles at the basis of Judgement just as there are in the case
542: of Understanding and of Reason; that these principles, like the
543: principles of Reason, are not constitutive but only regulative of
544: experience, _i.e._ that they do not teach us anything positive about
545: the characteristics of objects, but only indicate the conditions under
546: which we find it necessary to view them; and lastly, that we are thus
547: furnished with an _a priori_ philosophy of pleasure.
548: 
549: The fundamental principle underlying the procedure of the Judgement is
550: seen to be that of the purposiveness of Nature; nature is everywhere
551: adapted to ends or purposes, and thus constitutes a κόσμος, a
552: well-ordered whole. By this means, nature is regarded by us as if
553: its particular empirical laws were not isolated and disparate, but
554: connected and in relation, deriving their unity in seeming diversity
555: from an intelligence which is at the source of nature. It is only
556: by the assumption of such a principle that we can construe nature
557: to ourselves; and the principle is then said to be a transcendental
558: condition of the exercise of our judging faculty, but valid only for
559: the reflective, not for the determinant Judgement. It gives us pleasure
560: to view nature in this way; just as the contemplation of chaos would be
561: painful.
562: 
563: But this purposiveness may be only formal and subjective, or real
564: and objective. In some cases the purposiveness resides in the felt
565: harmony and accordance of the form of the object with the cognitive
566: faculties; in others the form of the object is judged to harmonise
567: with the purpose in view in its existence. That is to say, in the one
568: case we judge the form of the object to be purposive, as in the case
569: of a flower, but could not explain any purpose served by it; in the
570: other case we have a definite notion of what it is adapted for. In the
571: former case the aesthetical Judgement is brought to bear, in the latter
572: the teleological; and it thus appears that the Critique of Judgement
573: has two main divisions; it treats first of the philosophy of Taste, the
574: Beautiful and the Sublime in Nature; and secondly, of the Teleology of
575: nature’s working. It is a curious literary parallel that St. Augustine
576: hints (_Confessions_ iv. 15) that he had written a book, _De Pulchro
577: et Ápto_, in which these apparently distinct topics were combined;
578: “pulchrum esse, quod per se ipsum; aptum, autem, quod ad aliquid
579: accommodatum deceret.” A beautiful object has no purpose external to
580: itself and the observer; but a useful object serves further ends. Both,
581: however, may be brought under the higher category of things that are
582: reckoned _purposive_ by the Judgement.
583: 
584: We have here then, in the first place, a basis for an _a priori_
585: Philosophy of Taste; and Kant works out its details with great
586: elaboration. He borrowed little from the writings of his predecessors,
587: but struck out, as was ever his plan, a line of his own. He quotes
588: with approval from Burke’s _Treatise on the Sublime and Beautiful_,
589: which was accessible to him in a German translation; but is careful to
590: remark that it is as psychology, not as philosophy, that Burke’s work
591: has value. He may have read in addition Hutcheson’s _Inquiry_ which
592: had also been translated into German; and he was complete master of
593: Hume’s opinions. Of other writers on Beauty, he only names Batteux and
594: Lessing. Batteux was a French writer of repute who had attempted a
595: twofold arrangement of the Arts as they may be brought under Space and
596: under Time respectively, a mode of classification which would naturally
597: appeal to Kant. He does not seem, however, to have read the ancient
598: text-book on the subject, Aristotle’s _Poetics_, the principles of
599: which Lessing declared to be as certain as Euclid.
600: 
601: Following the guiding thread of the categories, he declares that
602: the aesthetical judgement about Beauty is according to _quality_
603: disinterested; a point which had been laid down by such different
604: writers as Hutcheson and Moses Mendelssohn. As to _quantity_, the
605: judgement about beauty gives universal satisfaction, although it is
606: based on no definite concept. The universality is only subjective; but
607: still it is there. The maxim _Trahit sua quemque voluptas_ does not
608: apply to the pleasure afforded by a pure judgement about beauty. As to
609: _relation_, the characteristic of the object called beautiful is that
610: it betrays a purposiveness without definite purpose. The pleasure is
611: _a priori_, independent on the one hand of the charms of sense or the
612: emotions of mere feeling, as Winckelmann had already declared; and
613: on the other hand is a pleasure quite distinct from that taken which
614: we feel when viewing perfection, with which Wolff and Baumgarten had
615: identified it. By his distinction between free and dependent beauty,
616: which we also find in the pages of Hutcheson, Kant further develops
617: his doctrine of the freedom of the pure judgement of taste from the
618: thraldom of concepts.
619: 
620: Finally, the satisfaction afforded by the contemplation of a beautiful
621: object is a necessary satisfaction. This necessity is not, to be sure,
622: theoretical like the necessity attaching to the Law of Causality; nor
623: is it a practical necessity as is the need to assume the Moral Law as
624: the guiding principle of conduct. But it may be called _exemplary_;
625: that is, we may set up our satisfaction in a beautiful picture as
626: setting an example to be followed by others. It is plain, however,
627: that this can only be assumed under certain presuppositions. We must
628: presuppose the idea of a _sensus communis_ or common sense in which all
629: men share. As knowledge admits of being communicated to others, so also
630: does the feeling for beauty. For the relation between the cognitive
631: faculties requisite for Taste is also requisite for Intelligence or
632: sound Understanding, and as we always presuppose the latter to be the
633: same in others as in ourselves, so may we presuppose the former.
634: 
635: The analysis of the Sublime which follows that of the Beautiful is
636: interesting and profound; indeed Schopenhauer regarded it as the
637: best part of the Critique of the Aesthetical Judgement. The general
638: characteristics of our judgements about the Sublime are similar to
639: those already laid down in the case of the Beautiful; but there
640: are marked differences in the two cases. If the pleasure taken in
641: beauty arises from a feeling of the purposiveness of the object in
642: its relation to the subject, that in sublimity rather expresses a
643: purposiveness of the subject in respect of the object. Nothing in
644: nature is sublime; and the sublimity really resides in the mind and
645: there alone. Indeed, as true Beauty is found, properly speaking, only
646: in beauty of form, the idea of sublimity is excited rather by those
647: objects which are formless and exhibit a violation of purpose.
648: 
649: A distinction not needed in the case of the Beautiful becomes
650: necessary when we proceed to further analyse the Sublime. For in
651: aesthetical judgements about the Beautiful the mind is in _restful_
652: contemplation; but in the case of the Sublime a mental _movement_ is
653: excited (pp. 105 and 120). This movement, as it is pleasing, must
654: involve a purposiveness in the harmony of the mental powers; and the
655: purposiveness may be either in reference to the faculty of cognition
656: or to that of desire. In the former case the sublime is called the
657: Mathematically Sublime--the sublime of mere magnitude--the absolutely
658: great; in the latter it is the sublime of power, the Dynamically
659: Sublime. Gioberti, an Italian writer on the philosophy of Taste, has
660: pushed this distinction so far as to find in it an explanation of the
661: relation between Beauty and Sublimity. “The dynamical Sublime,” he
662: says, “creates the Beautiful; the mathematical Sublime contains it,” a
663: remark with which probably Kant would have no quarrel.
664: 
665: In both cases, however, we find that the feeling of the Sublime awakens
666: in us a feeling of the supersensible destination of man. “The very
667: capacity of conceiving the sublime,” he tells us, “indicates a mental
668: faculty that far surpasses every standard of sense.” And to explain
669: the necessity belonging to our judgements about the sublime, Kant
670: points out that as we find ourselves compelled to postulate a _sensus
671: communis_ to account for the agreement of men in their appreciation of
672: beautiful objects, so the principle underlying their consent in judging
673: of the sublime is “the presupposition of the moral feeling in man.” The
674: feeling of the sublimity of our own moral destination is the necessary
675: prerequisite for forming such judgements. The connexion between Beauty
676: and Goodness involved to a Greek in the double sense of the word καλόν
677: is developed by Kant with keen insight. To feel interest in the beauty
678: of Nature he regards as a mark of a moral disposition, though he will
679: not admit that the same inference may be drawn as to the character
680: of the art connoisseur (§ 42). But it is specially with reference to
681: the connexion between the capacity for appreciating the Sublime, and
682: the moral feeling, that the originality of Kant’s treatment becomes
683: apparent.
684: 
685: The objects of nature, he continues, which we call sublime, inspire us
686: with a feeling of pain rather than of pleasure; as Lucretius has it--
687: 
688:           Me quaedam divina voluptas
689:     Percipit atque horror.
690: 
691: But this “horror” must not inspire actual fear. As no extraneous
692: charm must mingle with the satisfaction felt in a beautiful object,
693: if the judgement about beauty is to remain pure; so in the case of
694: the sublime we must not be afraid of the object which yet in certain
695: aspects is fearful.
696: 
697: This conception of the feelings of sublimity excited by the loneliness
698: of an Alpine peak or the grandeur of an earthquake is now a familiar
699: one; but it was not so in Kant’s day. Switzerland had not then become
700: the recreation-ground of Europe; and though natural beauty was a
701: familiar topic with poets and painters it was not generally recognised
702: that taste has also to do with the sublime. De Saussure’s _Travels_,
703: Haller’s poem _Die Alpen_, and this work of Kant’s mark the beginning
704: of a new epoch in our ways of looking at the sublime and terrible
705: aspects of Nature. And it is not a little remarkable that the man who
706: could write thus feelingly about the emotions inspired by grand and
707: savage scenery, had never seen a mountain in his life. The power and
708: the insight of his observations here are in marked contrast to the
709: poverty of some of his remarks about the characteristics of beauty. For
710: instance, he puts forward the curious doctrine that colour in a picture
711: is only an extraneous charm, and does not really add to the beauty
712: of the form delineated, nay rather distracts the mind from it. His
713: criticisms on this point, if sound, would make Flaxman a truer artist
714: than Titian or Paolo Veronese. But indeed his discussion of Painting or
715: Music is not very appreciative; he was, to the end, a creature of pure
716: Reason.
717: 
718: Upon the analysis he gives of the Arts, little need be said here. Fine
719: Art is regarded as the Art of Genius, “that innate mental disposition
720: through which Nature gives the rule to Art” (§ 46). Art differs
721: from Science in the absence of definite concepts in the mind of the
722: artist. It thus happens that the great artist can rarely communicate
723: his methods; indeed he cannot explain them even to himself. _Poeta
724: nascitur, non fit_; and the same is true in every form of fine art.
725: Genius is, in short, the faculty of presenting aesthetical Ideas; an
726: aesthetical Idea being an intuition of the Imagination, to which no
727: concept is adequate. And it is by the excitation of such ineffable
728: Ideas that a great work of art affects us. As Bacon tells us, “that is
729: the best part of Beauty which a picture cannot express; no, nor the
730: first sight of the eye.” This characteristic of the artistic genius
731: has been noted by all who have thought upon art; more is present in
732: its productions than can be perfectly expressed in language. As Pliny
733: said of Timanthus the painter of Iphigenia, “In omnibus ejus operibus
734: intelligitur plus super quam pingitur.” But this genius requires to be
735: kept in check by taste; quite in the spirit of the σωφροσύνη of the
736: best Greek art, Kant remarks that if in a work of art some feature must
737: be sacrificed, it is better to lose something of genius than to violate
738: the canons of taste. It is in this self-mastery that “the sanity of
739: true genius” expresses itself.
740: 
741: The main question with which the Critique of Judgement is concerned
742: is, of course, the question as to the purposiveness, the
743: _Zweckmässigkeit_, exhibited by nature. That nature appears to be
744: full of purpose is mere matter of fact. It displays purposiveness
745: in respect of our faculties of cognition, in those of its phenomena
746: which we designate beautiful. And also in its organic products we
747: observe methods of operation which we can only explain by describing
748: them as processes in which means are used to accomplish certain
749: ends, as processes that are _purposive_. In our observation of
750: natural phenomena, as Kuno Fischer puts it, we judge their _forms_
751: aesthetically, and their _life_ teleologically.
752: 
753: As regards the first kind of _Zweckmässigkeit_, that which is _ohne
754: Zweck_--the purposiveness of a beautiful object which does not seem to
755: be directed to any external end--there are two ways in which we may
756: account for it. We may either say that it was actually designed to
757: be beautiful by the Supreme Force behind Nature, or we may say that
758: purposiveness is not really resident in nature, but that our perception
759: of it is due to the subjective needs of our judging faculty. We have
760: to contemplate beautiful objects _as if_ they were purposive, but they
761: may not be so in reality. And this latter idealistic doctrine is what
762: Kant falls back upon. He appeals in support of it, to the phenomena of
763: crystallisation (pp. 243 _sqq._), in which many very beautiful forms
764: seem to be produced by merely mechanical processes. The beauty of a
765: rock crystal is apparently produced without any forethought on the
766: part of nature, and he urges that we are not justified in asserting
767: dogmatically that any laws distinct from those of mechanism are needed
768: to account for beauty in other cases. Mechanism can do so much; may it
769: not do all? And he brings forward as a consideration which ought to
770: settle the question, the fact that in judging of beauty “we invariably
771: seek its gauge _in ourselves a priori_”; we do not learn from nature,
772: but from ourselves, what we are to find beautiful. Mr. Kennedy in his
773: Donnellan Lectures has here pointed out several weak spots in Kant’s
774: armour. In the first place, the fact that we seek the gauge of beauty
775: in our own mind “may be shown from his own definition to be a necessary
776: result of the very nature of beauty.”[2] For Kant tells us that the
777: aesthetical judgement about beauty always involves “a reference of the
778: representation to the subject”; and this applies equally to judgements
779: about the beautiful in Art and the beautiful in Nature. But no one
780: could maintain that from this definition it follows that we are not
781: compelled to postulate design in the mind of the artist who paints a
782: beautiful picture. And thus as the fact that “we always seek the gauge
783: of beauty” in ourselves does not do away with the belief in a designing
784: mind when we are contemplating works of art, it cannot be said to
785: exclude the belief in a Master Hand which moulded the forms of Nature.
786: As Cicero has it, nature is “non artificiosa solum, sed plane artifex.”
787: But the cogency of this reasoning, for the details of which I must
788: refer the reader to Mr. Kennedy’s pages, becomes more apparent when
789: we reflect on that second form of purposiveness, viz. adaptation to
790: definite ends, with which we meet in the phenomena of organic life.
791: 
792: If we watch, _e.g._ the growth of a tree we perceive that its various
793: parts are not isolated and unconnected, but that on the contrary they
794: are only possible by reference to the idea of the whole. Each limb
795: affects every other, and is reciprocally affected by it; in short “in
796: such a product of nature every part not only exists _by means of_ the
797: other parts, but is thought as existing _for the sake of_ the others
798: and the whole” (p. 277). The operations of nature in organised bodies
799: seem to be of an entirely different character from mere mechanical
800: processes; we cannot construe them to ourselves except under the
801: hypothesis that nature in them is working towards a designed end.
802: The distinction between nature’s “Technic” or purposive operation,
803: and nature’s Mechanism is fundamental for the explanation of natural
804: law. The language of biology eloquently shows the impossibility of
805: eliminating at least the _idea_ of purpose from our investigations into
806: the phenomena of life, growth, and reproduction. And Kant dismisses
807: with scant respect that cheap and easy philosophy which would fain
808: deny the distinctiveness of nature’s purposive operation. A doctrine,
809: like that of Epicurus, in which every natural phenomenon is regarded
810: as the result of the blind drifting of atoms in accordance with purely
811: mechanical laws, really explains nothing, and least of all explains
812: that illusion in our teleological judgements which leads us to assume
813: purpose where really there is none.
814: 
815: It has been urged by Kirchmann and others that this distinction
816: between Technic and Mechanism, on which Kant lays so much stress,
817: has been disproved by the progress of modern science. The doctrines,
818: usually associated with the name of Darwin, of Natural Selection and
819: Survival of the Fittest, quite sufficiently explain, it is said, on
820: mechanical principles the semblance of purpose with which nature mocks
821: us. The presence of order is not due to any purpose behind the natural
822: operation, but to the inevitable disappearance of the disorderly. It
823: would be absurd, of course, to claim for Kant that he anticipated the
824: Darwinian doctrines of development; and yet passages are not wanting
825: in his writings in which he takes a view of the continuity of species
826: with which modern science would have little fault to find. “Nature
827: organises itself and its organised products in every species, no
828: doubt after one general pattern but yet with suitable deviations,
829: which self-preservation demands according to circumstances” (p. 279).
830: “The analogy of forms, which with all their differences seem to have
831: been produced according to a common original type, strengthens our
832: suspicions of an actual relationship between them in their production
833: from a common parent, through the gradual approximation of one animal
834: genus to another--from those in which the principle of purposes seems
835: to be best authenticated, _i.e._ from man, down to the polype and again
836: from this down to mosses and lichens, and finally to crude matter.
837: And so the whole Technic of nature, which is so incomprehensible to
838: us in organised beings that we believe ourselves compelled to think a
839: different principle for it, seems to be derived from matter and its
840: powers according to mechanical laws (like those by which it works in
841: the formation of crystals)” (p. 337). Such a theory he calls “a daring
842: venture of reason,” and its coincidences with modern science are real
843: and striking. But he is careful to add that such a theory, even if
844: established, would not eliminate purpose from the universe; it would
845: indeed suggest that certain special processes having the semblance of
846: purpose may be elucidated on mechanical principles, but on the whole,
847: purposive operation on the part of Mother Nature it would still be
848: needful to assume (p. 338). “No finite Reason can hope to understand
849: the production of even a blade of grass by mere mechanical causes”
850: (p. 326). “It is absurd to hope that another Newton will arise in the
851: future who shall make comprehensible by us the production of a blade of
852: grass according to natural laws which no design has ordered” (p. 312).
853: 
854: Crude materialism thus affording no explanation of the purposiveness
855: in nature, we go on to ask what other theories are logically possible.
856: We may dismiss at once the doctrine of Hylozoism, according to which
857: the purposes in nature are explained in reference to a world-soul,
858: which is the inner principle of the material universe and constitutes
859: its life. For such a doctrine is self-contradictory, inasmuch as
860: lifelessness, _inertia_, is the essential characteristic of matter,
861: and to talk of living matter is absurd (p. 304). A much more plausible
862: system is that of Spinoza, who aimed at establishing the ideality
863: of the principle of natural purposes. He regarded the world whole
864: as a complex of manifold determinations inhering in a single simple
865: substance; and thus reduced our concepts of the purposive in nature to
866: our own consciousness of existing in an all-embracing Being. But on
867: reflection we see that this does not so much explain as explain away
868: the purposiveness of nature; it gives us an unity of inherence _in_ one
869: Substance, but not an unity of causal dependence _on_ one Substance (p.
870: 303). And this latter would be necessary in order to explain the unity
871: of purpose which nature exhibits in its phenomenal working. Spinozism,
872: therefore, does not give what it pretends to give; it puts us off with
873: a vague and unfruitful unity of ground, when what we seek is a unity
874: that shall itself contain the causes of the differences manifest in
875: nature.
876: 
877: We have left then as the only remaining possible doctrine, Theism,
878: which represents natural purposes as produced in accordance with the
879: Will and Design of an Intelligent Author and Governor of Nature.
880: This theory is, in the first place, “superior to all other grounds
881: of explanation” (p. 305), for it gives a full solution of the
882: problem before us and enables us to maintain the reality of the
883: _Zweckmässigkeit_ of nature. “Teleology finds the consummation of its
884: investigations only in Theology” (p. 311). To represent the world
885: and the natural purposes therein as produced by an intelligent Cause
886: is “completely satisfactory from every human point of view for both
887: the speculative and practical use of our Reason” (p. 312). Thus the
888: contemplation of natural purposes, _i.e._ the common Argument from
889: Design, enables us to reach a highest Understanding as Cause of the
890: world “in accordance with the principles of the reflective Judgement,
891: _i.e._ _in accordance with the constitution of our human faculty of
892: cognition_” (p. 416).
893: 
894: It is in this qualifying clause that Kant’s negative attitude in
895: respect of Theism betrays itself. He regards it as a necessary
896: assumption for the guidance of scientific investigation, no less than
897: for the practical needs of morals; but he does not admit that we can
898: claim for it objective validity. In the language of the Critique of
899: Pure Reason, the Idea of God furnishes a regulative, not a constitutive
900: principle of Reason; or as he prefers to put it in the present work, it
901: is valid only for the reflective, not for the determinant Judgement. We
902: are not justified, Kant maintains, in asserting dogmatically that God
903: exists; there is only permitted to us the limited formula “We cannot
904: otherwise conceive the purposiveness which must lie at the basis of our
905: cognition of the internal possibility of many natural things, than by
906: representing it and the world in general as produced by an intelligent
907: cause, _i.e._ a God” (p. 312).
908: 
909: We ask then, whence arises this impossibility of objective statement?
910: It is in the true Kantian spirit to assert that no synthetical
911: proposition can be made with reference to what lies above and behind
912: the world of sense; but there is a difficulty in carrying out this
913: principle into details. Kant’s refusal to infer a designing Hand behind
914: the apparent order of nature is based, he tells us, on the fact that
915: the concept of a “natural purpose” is one that cannot be justified to
916: the speculative Reason. For all we know it may only indicate our way of
917: looking at things, and may point to no corresponding objective reality.
918: That we are forced by the limited nature of our faculties to view
919: nature as working towards ends, as purposive, does not prove that it is
920: really so. We cannot justify such pretended insight into what is behind
921: the veil.
922: 
923: It is to be observed, however, that precisely similar arguments might
924: be urged against our affirmation of purpose, design, will, as the
925: spring of the actions of other human beings.[3] For let us consider
926: why it is that, mind being assumed as the basis of our own individual
927: consciousness, we go on to attribute minds of like character to other
928: men. We see that the external behaviour of other men is similar to our
929: own, and that the most reasonable way of accounting for such behaviour
930: is to suppose that they have minds like ourselves, that they are
931: possessed of an active and spontaneously energising faculty, which is
932: the seat of their personality. But it is instructive to observe that
933: neither on Kantian principles nor on any other can we _demonstrate_
934: this; to cross the chasm which separates one man’s personality from
935: another’s requires a venture of faith just as emphatically as any
936: theological formula. I can by no means _prove_ to the determinant
937: Judgement that the complex of sensations which I constantly experience,
938: and which I call the Prime Minister, is anything more than a
939: well-ordered machine. It is improbable that this is the case--highly
940: improbable; but the falsity of such an hypothesis cannot be proved in
941: the same way that we would prove the falsity of the assertion that two
942: and two make five. But then though the hypothesis cannot be thus ruled
943: out of court by demonstration of its absurdity, it is not the simplest
944: hypothesis, nor is it that one which best accounts for the facts. The
945: assumption, on the other hand, that the men whom I meet every day have
946: minds like my own, perfectly accounts for all the facts, and is a very
947: simple assumption. It merely extends by induction the sphere of a force
948: which I already know to exist. Or in other words, crude materialism not
949: giving me an intelligent account of my own individual consciousness,
950: I recognise mind, νοῦς, as a _vera causa_, as something which really
951: does produce effects in the field of experience, and which therefore I
952: may legitimately put forward as the cause of those actions of other
953: men which externally so much resemble my own. But, as has been said
954: before, this argument, though entirely convincing to any sane person,
955: is not demonstrative; in Kantian language and on Kantian principles
956: the reasoning here used would seem to be valid only for the reflective
957: and not for the determinant Judgement. If the principle of design or
958: conscious adaptation of means to ends be not a constitutive principle
959: of experience, but only a regulative principle introduced to account
960: for the facts, what right have we to put it forward dogmatically as
961: affording an explanation of the actions of other human beings?
962: 
963: It cannot be said that Kant’s attempted answer to such a defence of
964: the Design Argument is quite conclusive. In § 90 of the _Methodology_
965: (p. 399) he pleads that though it is perfectly legitimate to argue by
966: analogy from our own minds to the minds of other men,--nay further,
967: although we may conclude from those actions of the lower animals
968: which display plan, that they are not, as Descartes alleged, mere
969: machines--yet it is not legitimate to conclude from the apparent
970: presence of design in the operations of nature that a conscious mind
971: directs those operations. For, he argues, that in comparing the actions
972: of men and the lower animals, or in comparing the actions of one man
973: with those of another, we are not pressing our analogy beyond the
974: limits of experience. Men and beasts alike are finite living beings,
975: subject to the limitations of finite existence; and hence the law which
976: governs the one series of operations may be regarded by analogy as
977: sufficiently explaining the other series. But the power at the basis of
978: Nature is utterly above definition or comprehension, and we are going
979: beyond our legitimate province if we venture to ascribe to it a mode
980: of operation with which we are only conversant in the case of beings
981: subject to the conditions of space and time. He urges in short that
982: when speaking about man and his mind we thoroughly understand what we
983: are talking about; but in speaking of the Mind of Deity we are dealing
984: with something of which we have no experience, and of which therefore
985: we have no right to predicate anything.
986: 
987: But it is apparent that, as has been pointed out, even when we infer
988: the existence of another finite mind from certain observed operations,
989: we are making an inference about something which is as mysterious an
990: _x_ as anything can be. Mind is not a thing that is subject to the
991: laws and conditions of the world of sense; it is “_in_ the world but
992: not _of_ the world.” And so to infer the existence of the mind of any
993: individual except myself is a quite different kind of inference from
994: that by which, for example, we infer the presence of an electro-magnet
995: in a given field. The action of the latter we understand to a large
996: extent; but we do not understand the action of mind, which yet we
997: know from daily experience of ourselves does produce effects in the
998: phenomenal world, often permanent and important effects. Briefly,
999: the action of mind upon matter (to use the ordinary phraseology for
1000: the sake of clearness) is--we may assume for our present purpose--an
1001: established fact. Hence the causality of mind is a _vera causa_; we
1002: bring it in to account for the actions of other human beings, and by
1003: precisely the same process of reasoning we invoke it to explain the
1004: operations of nature.
1005: 
1006: And it is altogether beside the point to urge, as Kant does
1007: incessantly, that in the latter case the intelligence inferred is
1008: _infinite_; in the former only _finite_. All that the Design Argument
1009: undertakes to prove is that mind lies at the basis of nature. It
1010: is quite beyond its province to say whether this mind is finite or
1011: infinite; and thus Kant’s criticisms on p. 364 are somewhat wide of
1012: the mark. There is always a difficulty in any argument which tries to
1013: establish the operation of mind anywhere, for mind cannot be seen or
1014: touched or felt; but the difficulty is not peculiar to that particular
1015: form of argument with which theological interests are involved.
1016: 
1017: The real plausibility of this objection arises from a vague idea,
1018: often present to us when we speak of _infinite_ wisdom or _infinite_
1019: intelligence, namely that the epithet _infinite_ in some way alters
1020: the meaning of the attributes to which it is applied. But the truth is
1021: that the word _infinite_, when applied to wisdom or knowledge or any
1022: other intellectual or moral quality, can only properly have reference
1023: to the number of acts of wisdom or knowledge that we suppose to have
1024: been performed. The only sense in which we have any right to speak of
1025: _infinite_ wisdom is that it is that which performs an infinite number
1026: of wise acts. And so when we speak of infinite _intelligence_, we have
1027: not the slightest warrant, either in logic or in common sense, for
1028: supposing that such intelligence is not similar in kind to that finite
1029: intelligence which we know in man.
1030: 
1031: To understand Kant’s attitude fully, we must also take into
1032: consideration the great weight that he attaches to the Moral Argument
1033: for the existence of God. The positive side of his teaching on Theism
1034: is summed up in the following sentence (p. 388): “For the theoretical
1035: reflective Judgement physical Teleology sufficiently proves from the
1036: purposes of Nature an intelligent world-cause; for the practical
1037: Judgement moral Teleology establishes it by the concept of a final
1038: purpose, which it is forced to ascribe to creation.” That side of his
1039: system which is akin to Agnosticism finds expression in his determined
1040: refusal to admit anything more than this. The existence of God is for
1041: him a “thing of faith”; and is not a fact of knowledge, strictly so
1042: called. “Faith” he holds (p. 409) “is the moral attitude of Reason as
1043: to belief in that which is unattainable by theoretical cognition. It
1044: is therefore the constant principle of the mind to assume as true that
1045: which it is necessary to presuppose as condition of the possibility of
1046: the highest moral final purpose.” As he says elsewhere (Introduction
1047: to Logic, ix. p. 60), “That man is morally _unbelieving_ who does not
1048: accept that which, though _impossible_ to know, is _morally necessary_
1049: to suppose.” And as far as he goes a Theist may agree with him, and he
1050: has done yeoman’s service to Theism by his insistence on the absolute
1051: impossibility of any other working hypothesis as an explanation of the
1052: phenomena of nature. But I have endeavoured to indicate at what points
1053: he does not seem to me to have gone as far as even his own declared
1054: principles would justify him in going. If the existence of a Supreme
1055: Mind be a “thing of faith,” this may with equal justice be said of the
1056: finite minds of the men all around us; and his attempt to show that the
1057: argument from analogy is here without foundation is not convincing.
1058: 
1059: Kant, however, in the Critique of Judgement is sadly fettered by
1060: the chains that he himself had forged, and frequently chafes under
1061: the restraints they impose. He indicates more than once a point of
1062: view higher than that of the Critique of Pure Reason, from which
1063: the phenomena of life and mind may be contemplated. He had already
1064: hinted in that work that the supersensible substrate of the ego and
1065: the non-ego might be identical. “Both kinds of objects differ from
1066: each other, not internally, but only so far as the one _appears_
1067: external to the other; possibly what is at the basis of phenomenal
1068: matter as a thing in itself may not be so heterogeneous after all
1069: as we imagine.”[4] This hypothesis which remains a bare undeveloped
1070: possibility in the earlier work is put forward as a positive doctrine
1071: in the Critique of Judgement. “There must,” says Kant, “be a ground
1072: of the _unity_ of the supersensible, which lies at the basis of
1073: nature, with that which the concept of freedom practically contains”
1074: (Introduction, p. 13). That is to say, he maintains that to explain
1075: the phenomena of organic life and the purposiveness of nature we must
1076: hold that the world of sense is not disparate from and opposed to the
1077: world of thought, but that _nature is the development of freedom_.
1078: The connexion of nature and freedom is suggested by, nay is involved
1079: in, the notion of natural adaptation; and although we can arrive
1080: at no knowledge of the supersensible substrate of both, yet such a
1081: common ground there must be. This principle is the starting-point of
1082: the systems which followed that of Kant; and the philosophy of later
1083: Idealism is little more than a development of the principle in its
1084: consequences.
1085: 
1086: He approaches the same doctrine by a different path in the Critique of
1087: the Teleological Judgement (§ 77), where he argues that the distinction
1088: between the mechanical and the teleological working of nature, upon
1089: which so much stress has been justly laid, depends for its validity
1090: upon the peculiar character of our Understanding. When we give what may
1091: be called a mechanical elucidation of any natural phenomenon, we begin
1092: with its parts, and from what we know of them we explain the whole. But
1093: in the case of certain objects, _e.g._ organised bodies, this cannot be
1094: done. In their case we can only account for the parts by a reference to
1095: the whole. Now, were it possible for us to perceive a whole before its
1096: parts and derive the latter from the former,[5] then an organism would
1097: be capable of being understood and would be an object of knowledge in
1098: the strictest sense. But our Understanding is not able to do this, and
1099: its inadequacy for such a task leads us to conceive the possibility of
1100: an Understanding, not discursive like ours, but intuitive, for which
1101: knowledge of the whole would precede that of the parts. “It is at
1102: least possible to consider the material world as mere phenomenon, and
1103: to think as its substrate something like a thing in itself (which is
1104: not phenomenon), and to attach to this a corresponding intellectual
1105: intuition. Thus there would be, although incognisable by us, a
1106: supersensible real ground for nature, to which we ourselves belong”
1107: (p. 325). Hence, although Mechanism and Technic must not be confused
1108: and must ever stand side by side in our scientific investigation of
1109: natural law, yet must they be regarded as coalescing in a single higher
1110: principle incognisable by us. The ground of union is “the supersensible
1111: substrate of nature of which we can determine nothing positively,
1112: except that it is the being in itself of which we merely know the
1113: phenomenon.” Thus, then, it appears that the whole force of Kant’s
1114: main argument has proceeded upon an assumption, viz. the permanent
1115: opposition between Sense and Understanding, which the progress of the
1116: argument has shown to be unsound. “Kant seems,” says Goethe,[6] “to
1117: have woven a certain element of irony into his method. For, while at
1118: one time he seemed to be bent on limiting our faculties of knowledge in
1119: the narrowest way, at another time he pointed, as it were with a side
1120: gesture, beyond the limits which he himself had drawn.” The fact of
1121: adaptation of means to ends observable in nature seems to break down
1122: the barrier between Nature and Freedom; and if we once relinquish the
1123: distinction between Mechanism and Technic in the operations of nature
1124: we are led to the Idea of an absolute Being, who manifests Himself by
1125: action which, though necessary, is yet the outcome of perfect freedom.
1126: 
1127: Kant, however, though he approaches such a position more than once,
1128: can never be said to have risen to it. He deprecates unceasingly the
1129: attempt to combine principles of nature with the principles of freedom
1130: as a task beyond the modest capacity of human reason; and while
1131: strenuously insisting on the practical force of the Moral Argument for
1132: the Being of God, which is found in the witness of man’s conscience,
1133: will not admit that it can in any way be regarded as strengthening the
1134: theoretical arguments adduced by Teleology. The two lines of proof, he
1135: holds, are quite distinct; and nothing but confusion and intellectual
1136: disaster can result from the effort to combine them. The moral proof
1137: stands by itself, and it needs no such crutches as the argument
1138: from Design can offer. But, as Mr. Kennedy has pointed out in his
1139: acute criticism[7] of the Kantian doctrine of Theism, it would not
1140: be possible to combine a theoretical _disbelief_ in God with a frank
1141: acceptance of the practical belief of His existence borne in upon us
1142: by the Moral Law. Kant himself admits this: “A dogmatical _unbelief_,”
1143: he says (p. 411), “cannot subsist together with a moral maxim dominant
1144: in the mental attitude.” That is, though the theoretical argument be
1145: incomplete, we cannot reject the conclusion to which it leads, for this
1146: is confirmed by the moral necessities of conscience.
1147: 
1148: Kant’s position, then, seems to come to this, that though he never
1149: doubts the existence of God, he has very grave doubts that He can
1150: be theoretically known by man. _That_ He is, is certain; _what_ He
1151: is, we cannot determine. It is a position not dissimilar to current
1152: Agnostic doctrines; and as long as the antithesis between Sense and
1153: Understanding, between Matter and Mind, is insisted upon as expressing
1154: a real and abiding truth, Kant’s reasoning can hardly be refuted
1155: with completeness. No doubt it may be urged that since the practical
1156: and theoretical arguments both arrive at the same conclusion, the
1157: cogency of our reasoning in the latter should confirm our trust in
1158: the former. But true conclusions may sometimes seem to follow from
1159: quite insufficient premises; and Kant is thus justified in demanding
1160: that each argument shall be submitted to independent tests. I have
1161: endeavoured to show above that he has not treated the theoretical line
1162: of reasoning quite fairly, and that he has underestimated its force;
1163: but its value _as an argument_ is not increased by showing that another
1164: entirely different process of thought leads to the same result. And
1165: that the witness of conscience affords the most powerful and convincing
1166: argument for the existence of a Supreme Being, the source of law as of
1167: love, is a simple matter of experience. Induction, syllogism, analogy,
1168: do not really generate belief in God, though they may serve to justify
1169: to reason a faith that we already possess. The poet has the truth of it:
1170: 
1171:     Wer Gott nicht fühlt in sich und allen Lebenskreisen,
1172:     Dem werdet Ihr Ihn nicht beweisen mit Beweisen.
1173: 
1174:        *       *       *       *       *
1175: 
1176: I give at the end of this Introduction a Glossary of the chief
1177: philosophical terms used by Kant; I have tried to render them by the
1178: same English equivalents all through the work, in order to preserve,
1179: as far as may be, the exactness of expression in the original. I am
1180: conscious that this makes the translation clumsy in many places, but
1181: have thought it best to sacrifice elegance to precision. This course
1182: is the more necessary to adopt, as Kant cannot be understood unless
1183: his nice verbal distinctions be attended to. Thus _real_ means quite
1184: a different thing from _wirklich_; _Hang_ from _Neigung_; _Rührung_
1185: from _Affekt_ or _Leidenschaft_; _Anschauung_ from _Empfindung_
1186: or _Wahrnehmung_; _Endzweck_ from _letzter Zweck_; _Idee_ from
1187: _Vorstellung_; _Eigenschaft_ from _Attribut_ or _Beschaffenheit_;
1188: _Schranke_ from _Grenze_; _überreden_ from _überzeugen_, etc. I am not
1189: satisfied with “gratification” and “grief” as the English equivalents
1190: for _Vergnügen_ and _Schmerz_; but it is necessary to distinguish these
1191: words from _Lust_ and _Unlust_, and “mental pleasure,” “mental pain,”
1192: which would nearly hit the sense, are awkward. Again, the constant
1193: rendering of _schön_ by beautiful involves the expression “beautiful
1194: art” instead of the more usual phrase “fine art.” _Purposive_ is an
1195: ugly word, but it has come into use lately; and its employment enables
1196: us to preserve the connexion between _Zweck_ and _zweckmässig_. I
1197: have printed _Judgement_ with a capital letter when it signifies
1198: the _faculty_, with a small initial when it signifies the _act_, of
1199: judging. And in like manner I distinguish _Objekt_ from _Gegenstand_,
1200: by printing the word “Object,” when it represents the former, with a
1201: large initial.
1202: 
1203: The text I have followed is, in the main, that printed by Hartenstein;
1204: but occasionally Rosenkranz preserves the better reading. All important
1205: variants between the First and Second Editions have been indicated at
1206: the foot of the page. A few notes have been added, which are enclosed
1207: in square brackets, to distinguish them from those which formed part
1208: of the original work. I have in general quoted Kant’s _Introduction to
1209: Logic_ and _Critique of Practical Reason_ in Dr. Abbott’s translations.
1210: 
1211: My best thanks are due to Rev. J. H. Kennedy and Mr. F. Purser for much
1212: valuable aid during the passage of this translation through the press.
1213: And I am under even greater obligations to Mr. Mahaffy, who was good
1214: enough to read through the whole of the proof; by his acute and learned
1215: criticisms many errors have been avoided. Others I have no doubt still
1216: remain, but for these I must be accounted alone responsible.

1225: More than twenty-one years have passed since the first edition of this
1226: Translation was published, and during that time much has been written,
1227: both in Germany and in England, on the subject of Kant’s _Critique
1228: of Judgement_. In particular, the German text has been critically
1229: determined by the labours of Professor Windelband, whose fine edition
1230: forms the fifth volume of Kant’s Collected Works as issued by the Royal
1231: Prussian Academy of Sciences (Berlin, 1908). It will be indispensable
1232: to future students. An excellent account of the significance, in the
1233: Kantian system, of the _Urtheilskraft_, by Mr. R. A. C. Macmillan,
1234: appeared in 1912; and Mr. J. C. Meredith has published recently an
1235: English edition of the _Critique of Aesthetical Judgement_, with notes
1236: and essays, dealing with the philosophy of art, which goes over the
1237: ground very fully.
1238: 
1239: Some critics of my first edition took exception to the clumsiness
1240: of the word “representation” as the equivalent of _Vorstellung_, but
1241: I have made no change in this respect, as it seems to me (and so far
1242: as I have observed to others who have worked on the _Critique of
1243: Judgement_), that it is necessary to preserve in English the relation
1244: between the noun _Vorstellung_ and the verb _vorstellen_, if Kant’s
1245: reasoning is to be exhibited clearly. I have, however, abandoned the
1246: attempt to preserve the word _Kritik_ in English, and have replaced it
1247: by _Critique_ or _criticism_, throughout. The other changes that have
1248: been made are mere corrections or emendations of faulty or obscure
1249: renderings, with a few additional notes. I have left my original
1250: Introduction as it was written in 1892, without attempting any fresh
1251: examination of the problems that Kant set himself.

1361: PREFACE
1362: 
1363: 
1364: We may call the faculty of cognition from principles _a priori_, _pure
1365: Reason_, and the inquiry into its possibility and bounds generally the
1366: Critique of pure Reason, although by this faculty we only understand
1367: Reason in its theoretical employment, as it appears under that name
1368: in the former work; without wishing to inquire into its faculty, as
1369: practical Reason, according to its special principles. That [Critique]
1370: goes merely into our faculty of knowing things _a priori_, and busies
1371: itself therefore only with the _cognitive faculty_ to the exclusion
1372: of the feeling of pleasure and pain and the faculty of desire; and of
1373: the cognitive faculties it only concerns itself with _Understanding_,
1374: according to its principles _a priori_, to the exclusion of _Judgement_
1375: and _Reason_ (as faculties alike belonging to theoretical cognition),
1376: because it is found in the sequel that no other cognitive faculty but
1377: the Understanding can furnish constitutive principles of cognition _a
1378: priori_. The Critique, then, which sifts them all, as regards the share
1379: which each of the other faculties might pretend to have in the clear
1380: possession of knowledge from its own peculiar root, leaves nothing but
1381: what the _Understanding_ prescribes _a priori_ as law for nature as
1382: the complex of phenomena (whose form also is given _a priori_). It
1383: relegates all other pure concepts under Ideas, which are transcendent
1384: for our theoretical faculty of cognition, but are not therefore useless
1385: or to be dispensed with. For they serve as regulative principles;
1386: partly to check the dangerous pretensions of Understanding, as if
1387: (because it can furnish _a priori_ the conditions of the possibility
1388: of all things which it can know) it had thereby confined within
1389: these bounds the possibility of all things in general; and partly to
1390: lead it to the consideration of nature according to a principle of
1391: completeness, although it can never attain to this, and thus to further
1392: the final design of all knowledge.
1393: 
1394: It was then properly the _Understanding_ which has its special realm in
1395: the _cognitive faculty_, so far as it contains constitutive principles
1396: of cognition _a priori_, which by the Critique, comprehensively called
1397: the Critique of pure Reason, was to be placed in certain and sole
1398: possession[8] against all other competitors. And so also to _Reason_,
1399: which contains constitutive principles _a priori_ nowhere except simply
1400: in respect of the _faculty of desire_, should be assigned its place in
1401: the Critique of practical Reason.
1402: 
1403: Whether now the _Judgement_, which in the order of our cognitive
1404: faculties forms a mediating link between Understanding and Reason, has
1405: also principles _a priori_ for itself; whether these are constitutive
1406: or merely regulative (thus indicating no special realm); and whether
1407: they give a rule _a priori_ to the feeling of pleasure and pain, as the
1408: mediating link between the cognitive faculty and the faculty of desire
1409: (just as the Understanding prescribes laws _a priori_ to the first,
1410: Reason to the second); these are the questions with which the present
1411: Critique of Judgement is concerned.
1412: 
1413: A Critique of pure Reason, _i.e._ of our faculty of judging _a priori_
1414: according to principles, would be incomplete, if the Judgement, which
1415: as a cognitive faculty also makes claim to such principles, were not
1416: treated as a particular part of it; although its principles in a
1417: system of pure Philosophy need form no particular part between the
1418: theoretical and the practical, but can be annexed when needful to one
1419: or both as occasion requires. For if such a system is one day to be
1420: completed under the general name of Metaphysic (which it is possible
1421: to achieve quite completely, and which is supremely important for the
1422: use of Reason in every reference), the soil for the edifice must be
1423: explored by Criticism as deep down as the foundation of the faculty of
1424: principles independent of experience, in order that it may sink in no
1425: part, for this would inevitably bring about the downfall of the whole.
1426: 
1427: We can easily infer from the nature of the Judgement (whose right use
1428: is so necessarily and so universally requisite, that by the name of
1429: sound Understanding nothing else but this faculty is meant), that it
1430: must be attended with great difficulties to find a principle peculiar
1431: to it; (some such it must contain _a priori_ in itself, for otherwise
1432: it would not be set apart by the commonest Criticism as a special
1433: cognitive faculty). This principle must not be derived _a priori_ from
1434: concepts, for these belong to the Understanding, and Judgement is only
1435: concerned with their application. It must, therefore, furnish of itself
1436: a concept, through which, properly speaking, no thing is cognised,
1437: but which only serves as a rule, though not an objective one to which
1438: it can adapt its judgement; because for this latter another faculty
1439: of Judgement would be requisite, in order to be able to distinguish
1440: whether [any given case] is or is not the case for the rule.
1441: 
1442: This perplexity about a principle (whether it is subjective or
1443: objective) presents itself mainly in those judgements that we call
1444: aesthetical, which concern the Beautiful and the Sublime of Nature or
1445: of Art. And, nevertheless, the critical investigation of a principle
1446: of Judgement in these is the most important part in a Critique of
1447: this faculty. For although they do not by themselves contribute to
1448: the knowledge of things, yet they belong to the cognitive faculty
1449: alone, and point to an immediate reference of this faculty to the
1450: feeling of pleasure or pain according to some principle _a priori_;
1451: without confusing this with what may be the determining ground of the
1452: faculty of desire, which has its principles _a priori_ in concepts
1453: of Reason.--In the logical judging of nature, experience exhibits a
1454: conformity to law in things, to the understanding or to the explanation
1455: of which the general concept of the sensible does not attain; here the
1456: Judgement can only derive from itself a principle of the reference of
1457: the natural thing to the unknowable supersensible (a principle which it
1458: must only use from its own point of view for the cognition of nature).
1459: And so, though in this case such a principle _a priori_ can and must be
1460: applied to the _cognition_ of the beings of the world, and opens out
1461: at the same time prospects which are advantageous for the practical
1462: Reason, yet it has no immediate reference to the feeling of pleasure
1463: and pain. But this reference is precisely the puzzle in the principle
1464: of Judgement, which renders a special section for this faculty
1465: necessary in the Critique; since the logical judging according to
1466: concepts (from which an immediate inference can never be drawn to the
1467: feeling of pleasure and pain) along with their critical limitation, has
1468: at all events been capable of being appended to the theoretical part of
1469: Philosophy.
1470: 
1471: The examination of the faculty of taste, as the aesthetical Judgement,
1472: is not here planned in reference to the formation or the culture of
1473: taste (for this will take its course in the future as in the past
1474: without any such investigations), but merely in a transcendental point
1475: of view. Hence, I trust that as regards the deficiency of the former
1476: purpose it will be judged with indulgence, though in the latter point
1477: of view it must be prepared for the severest scrutiny. But I hope that
1478: the great difficulty of solving a problem so involved by nature may
1479: serve as excuse for some hardly avoidable obscurity in its solution, if
1480: only it be clearly established that the principle is correctly stated.
1481: I grant that the mode of deriving the phenomena of the Judgement from
1482: it has not all the clearness which might be rightly demanded elsewhere,
1483: viz. in the case of cognition according to concepts; but I believe that
1484: I have attained to it in the second part of this work.
1485: 
1486: Here then I end my whole critical undertaking. I shall proceed without
1487: delay to the doctrinal [part] in order to profit, as far as is
1488: possible, by the more favourable moments of my increasing years. It is
1489: obvious that in this [part] there will be no special section for the
1490: Judgement, because in respect of this faculty Criticism serves instead
1491: of Theory; but, according to the division of Philosophy (and also of
1492: pure Philosophy) into theoretical and practical, the Metaphysic of
1493: Nature and of Morals will complete the undertaking.

1497: 
1498: INTRODUCTION
1499: 
1500: I. OF THE DIVISION OF PHILOSOPHY
1501: 
1502: 
1503: We proceed quite correctly if, as usual, we divide Philosophy, as
1504: containing the principles of the rational cognition of things by means
1505: of concepts (not merely, as logic does, principles of the form of
1506: thought in general without distinction of Objects), into _theoretical_
1507: and _practical_. But then the concepts, which furnish their Object
1508: to the principles of this rational cognition, must be specifically
1509: distinct; otherwise they would not justify a division, which always
1510: presupposes a contrast between the principles of the rational cognition
1511: belonging to the different parts of a science.
1512: 
1513: Now there are only two kinds of concepts, and these admit as many
1514: distinct principles of the possibility of their objects, viz. _natural
1515: concepts_ and the _concept of freedom_. The former render possible
1516: _theoretical_ cognition according to principles _a priori_; the latter
1517: in respect of this theoretical cognition only supplies in itself a
1518: negative principle (that of mere contrast), but on the other hand it
1519: furnishes fundamental propositions which extend the sphere of the
1520: determination of the will and are therefore called practical. Thus
1521: Philosophy is correctly divided into two parts, quite distinct in
1522: their principles; the theoretical part or _Natural Philosophy_, and
1523: the practical part or _Moral Philosophy_ (for that is the name given
1524: to the practical legislation of Reason in accordance with the concept
1525: of freedom). But up to the present a gross misuse of these expressions
1526: has prevailed, both in the division of the different principles and
1527: consequently also of Philosophy itself. For what is practical according
1528: to natural concepts has been identified with the practical according
1529: to the concept of freedom; and so with the like titles, ‘theoretical’
1530: and ‘practical’ Philosophy, a division has been made, by which in
1531: fact nothing has been divided (for both parts might in such case have
1532: principles of the same kind).
1533: 
1534: The will, regarded as the faculty of desire, is (in this view) one
1535: of the many natural causes in the world, viz. that cause which acts
1536: in accordance with concepts. All that is represented as possible (or
1537: necessary) by means of a will is called practically possible (or
1538: necessary); as distinguished from the physical possibility or necessity
1539: of an effect, whose cause is not determined to causality by concepts
1540: (but in lifeless matter by mechanism and in animals by instinct).
1541: Here, in respect of the practical, it is left undetermined whether the
1542: concept which gives the rule to the causality of the will, is a natural
1543: concept or a concept of freedom.
1544: 
1545: But the last distinction is essential. For if the concept which
1546: determines the causality is a natural concept, then the principles are
1547: _technically practical_; whereas, if it is a concept of freedom they
1548: are _morally practical_. And as the division of a rational science
1549: depends on the distinction between objects whose cognition needs
1550: distinct principles, the former will belong to theoretical Philosophy
1551: (doctrine of Nature), but the latter alone will constitute the second
1552: part, viz. practical Philosophy (doctrine of Morals).
1553: 
1554: All technically practical rules (_i.e._ the rules of art and skill
1555: generally, or of prudence regarded as skill in exercising an influence
1556: over men and their wills), so far as their principles rest on concepts,
1557: must be reckoned only as corollaries to theoretical Philosophy. For
1558: they concern only the possibility of things according to natural
1559: concepts, to which belong not only the means which are to be met
1560: with in nature, but also the will itself (as a faculty of desire
1561: and consequently a natural faculty), so far as it can be determined
1562: conformably to these rules by natural motives. However, practical
1563: rules of this kind are not called laws (like physical laws), but only
1564: precepts; because the will does not stand merely under the natural
1565: concept, but also under the concept of freedom, in relation to which
1566: its principles are called laws. These with their consequences alone
1567: constitute the second or practical part of Philosophy.
1568: 
1569: The solution of the problems of pure geometry does not belong to a
1570: particular part of the science; mensuration does not deserve the
1571: name of practical, in contrast to pure, geometry, as a second part
1572: of geometry in general; and just as little ought the mechanical
1573: or chemical art of experiment or observation to be reckoned as a
1574: practical part of the doctrine of Nature. Just as little, in fine,
1575: ought housekeeping, farming, statesmanship, the art of conversation,
1576: the prescribing of diet, the universal doctrine of happiness itself,
1577: or the curbing of the inclinations and checking of the affections
1578: for the sake of happiness, to be reckoned as practical Philosophy,
1579: or taken to constitute the second part of Philosophy in general.
1580: For all these contain only rules of skill (and are consequently only
1581: technically practical) for bringing about an effect that is possible
1582: according to the natural concepts of causes and effects, which, since
1583: they belong to theoretical Philosophy, are subject to those precepts
1584: as mere corollaries from it (viz. natural science), and can therefore
1585: claim no place in a special Philosophy called practical. On the other
1586: hand, the morally practical precepts, which are altogether based on the
1587: concept of freedom to the complete exclusion of the natural determining
1588: grounds of the will, constitute a quite special class. These, like the
1589: rules which nature obeys, are called simply laws, but they do not, like
1590: them, rest on sensuous conditions but on a supersensible principle;
1591: and accordingly they require for themselves a quite different part of
1592: Philosophy, called practical, corresponding to its theoretical part.
1593: 
1594: We hence see that a complex of practical precepts given by Philosophy
1595: does not constitute a distinct part of Philosophy, as opposed to the
1596: theoretical part, because these precepts are practical; for they might
1597: be that, even if their principles were derived altogether from the
1598: theoretical cognition of nature (as technically practical rules). [A
1599: distinct branch of Philosophy is constituted only] if their principle,
1600: as it is not borrowed from the natural concept, which is always
1601: sensuously conditioned, rests on the supersensible, which alone makes
1602: the concept of freedom cognisable by formal laws. These precepts are
1603: then morally practical, _i.e._ not merely precepts or rules in this
1604: or that aspect, but, without any preceding reference to purposes and
1605: designs, are laws.
1606: 
1607: 
1608: II. OF THE REALM OF PHILOSOPHY IN GENERAL
1609: 
1610: So far as our concepts have _a priori_ application, so far extends
1611: the use of our cognitive faculty according to principles, and with it
1612: Philosophy.
1613: 
1614: But the complex of all objects, to which those concepts are referred,
1615: in order to bring about a knowledge of them where it is possible,
1616: may be subdivided according to the adequacy or inadequacy of our
1617: [cognitive] faculty to this design.
1618: 
1619: Concepts, so far as they are referred to objects, independently of the
1620: possibility or impossibility of the cognition of these objects, have
1621: their field which is determined merely according to the relation that
1622: their Object has to our cognitive faculty in general. The part of this
1623: field in which knowledge is possible for us is a ground or territory
1624: (_territorium_) for these concepts and the requisite cognitive faculty.
1625: The part of this territory, where they are legislative, is the realm
1626: (_ditio_) of these concepts and of the corresponding cognitive
1627: faculties. Empirical concepts have, therefore, their territory in
1628: nature, as the complex of all objects of sense, but no realm, only
1629: a dwelling-place (_domicilium_); for though they are produced in
1630: conformity to law they are not legislative, but the rules based on them
1631: are empirical and consequently contingent.
1632: 
1633: Our whole cognitive faculty has two realms, that of natural concepts
1634: and that of the concept of freedom; for through both it is legislative
1635: _a priori_. In accordance with this, Philosophy is divided into
1636: theoretical and practical. But the territory to which its realm extends
1637: and in which its legislation is _exercised_, is always only the complex
1638: of objects of all possible experience, so long as they are taken for
1639: nothing more than mere phenomena; for otherwise no legislation of the
1640: Understanding in respect of them is conceivable.
1641: 
1642: Legislation through natural concepts is carried on by means of the
1643: Understanding and is theoretical. Legislation through the concept of
1644: freedom is carried on by the Reason and is merely practical. It is
1645: only in the practical [sphere] that the Reason can be legislative;
1646: in respect of theoretical cognition (of nature) it can merely (as
1647: acquainted with law by the Understanding) deduce from given laws
1648: consequences which always remain within [the limits of] nature. But on
1649: the other hand, Reason is not always therefore _legislative_, where
1650: there are practical rules, for they may be only technically practical.
1651: 
1652: Understanding and Reason exercise, therefore, two distinct legislations
1653: in regard to one and the same territory of experience, without
1654: prejudice to each other. The concept of freedom as little disturbs
1655: the legislation of nature, as the natural concept influences the
1656: legislation through the former.--The possibility of at least thinking
1657: without contradiction the co-existence of both legislations, and of
1658: the corresponding faculties in the same subject, has been shown in the
1659: Critique of pure Reason; for it annulled the objections on the other
1660: side by exposing the dialectical illusion which they contain.
1661: 
1662: These two different realms then do not limit each other in their
1663: legislation, though they perpetually do so in the world of sense.
1664: That they do not constitute _one_ realm, arises from this, that the
1665: natural concept represents its objects in intuition, not as things
1666: in themselves, but as mere phenomena; the concept of freedom, on the
1667: other hand, represents in its Object a thing in itself, but not in
1668: intuition. Hence, neither of them can furnish a theoretical knowledge
1669: of its Object (or even of the thinking subject) as a thing in itself;
1670: this would be the supersensible, the Idea of which we must indeed make
1671: the basis of the possibility of all these objects of experience, but
1672: which we can never extend or elevate into a cognition.
1673: 
1674: There is, then, an unbounded but also inaccessible field for our whole
1675: cognitive faculty--the field of the supersensible--wherein we find no
1676: territory, and, therefore, can have in it, for theoretical cognition,
1677: no realm either for concepts of Understanding or Reason. This field we
1678: must indeed occupy with Ideas on behalf of the theoretical as well as
1679: the practical use of Reason, but we can supply to them in reference to
1680: the laws [arising] from the concept of freedom no other than practical
1681: reality, by which our theoretical cognition is not extended in the
1682: slightest degree towards the supersensible.
1683: 
1684: Now even if an immeasurable gulf is fixed between the sensible realm
1685: of the concept of nature and the supersensible realm of the concept of
1686: freedom, so that no transition is possible from the first to the second
1687: (by means of the theoretical use of Reason), just as if they were two
1688: different worlds of which the first could have no influence upon the
1689: second, yet the second is _meant_ to have an influence upon the first.
1690: The concept of freedom is meant to actualise in the world of sense
1691: the purpose proposed by its laws, and consequently nature must be so
1692: thought that the conformity to law of its form, at least harmonises
1693: with the possibility of the purposes to be effected in it according to
1694: laws of freedom.--There must, therefore, be a ground of the _unity_
1695: of the supersensible, which lies at the basis of nature, with that
1696: which the concept of freedom practically contains; and the concept
1697: of this ground, although it does not attain either theoretically or
1698: practically to a knowledge of the same, and hence has no peculiar
1699: realm, nevertheless makes possible the transition from the mode of
1700: thought according to the principles of the one to that according to the
1701: principles of the other.
1702: 
1703: 
1704: III. OF THE CRITIQUE OF JUDGEMENT AS A MEANS OF COMBINING THE TWO PARTS
1705: OF PHILOSOPHY INTO A WHOLE.
1706: 
1707: The Critique of the cognitive faculties, as regards what they can
1708: furnish _a priori_, has properly speaking no realm in respect of
1709: Objects, because it is not a doctrine, but only has to investigate
1710: whether and how, in accordance with the state of these faculties, a
1711: doctrine is possible by their means. Its field extends to all their
1712: pretensions, in order to confine them within their legitimate bounds.
1713: But what cannot enter into the division of Philosophy may yet enter,
1714: as a chief part, into the Critique of the pure faculty of cognition in
1715: general, viz. if it contains principles which are available neither for
1716: theoretical nor for practical use.
1717: 
1718: The natural concepts, which contain the ground of all
1719: theoretical knowledge _a priori_, rest on the legislation of the
1720: Understanding.--The concept of freedom, which contains the ground of
1721: all sensuously-unconditioned practical precepts _a priori_, rests on
1722: the legislation of the Reason. Both faculties, therefore, besides being
1723: capable of application as regards their logical form to principles of
1724: whatever origin, have also as regards their content, their special
1725: legislations above which there is no other (_a priori_); and hence the
1726: division of Philosophy into theoretical and practical is justified.
1727: 
1728: But in the family of the higher cognitive faculties there is a middle
1729: term between the Understanding and the Reason. This is the _Judgement_,
1730: of which we have cause for supposing according to analogy that it
1731: may contain in itself, if not a special legislation, yet a special
1732: principle of its own to be sought according to laws, though merely
1733: subjective _a priori_. This principle, even if it have no field of
1734: objects as its realm, yet may have somewhere a territory with a certain
1735: character, for which no other principle can be valid.
1736: 
1737: But besides (to judge by analogy) there is a new ground for bringing
1738: the Judgement into connexion with another arrangement of our
1739: representative faculties, which seems to be of even greater importance
1740: than that of its relationship with the family of the cognitive
1741: faculties. For all faculties or capacities of the soul can be reduced
1742: to three, which cannot be any further derived from one common ground:
1743: the _faculty of knowledge_, the _feeling of pleasure and pain_, and the
1744: _faculty of desire_.[9] For the faculty of knowledge the Understanding
1745: is alone legislative, if (as must happen when it is considered by
1746: itself without confusion with the faculty of desire) this faculty is
1747: referred to nature as the faculty of _theoretical knowledge_; for in
1748: respect of nature (as phenomenon) it is alone possible for us to give
1749: laws by means of natural concepts _a priori_, _i.e._ by pure concepts
1750: of Understanding.--For the faculty of desire, as a higher faculty
1751: according to the concept of freedom, the Reason (in which alone this
1752: concept has a place) is alone _a priori_ legislative.--Now between the
1753: faculties of knowledge and desire there is the feeling of pleasure,
1754: just as the Judgement is intermediate between the Understanding and
1755: the Reason. We may therefore suppose provisionally that the Judgement
1756: likewise contains in itself an _a priori_ principle. And as pleasure
1757: or pain is necessarily combined with the faculty of desire (either
1758: preceding this principle as in the lower desires, or following it as
1759: in the higher, when the desire is determined by the moral law), we may
1760: also suppose that the Judgement will bring about a transition from the
1761: pure faculty of knowledge, the realm of natural concepts, to the realm
1762: of the concept of freedom, just as in its logical use it makes possible
1763: the transition from Understanding to Reason.
1764: 
1765: Although, then, Philosophy can be divided only into two main parts,
1766: the theoretical and the practical, and although all that we may be
1767: able to say of the special principles of Judgement must be counted as
1768: belonging in it to the theoretical part, _i.e._ to rational cognition
1769: in accordance with natural concepts; yet the Critique of pure Reason,
1770: which must decide all this, as regards the possibility of the system
1771: before undertaking it, consists of three parts; the Critique of pure
1772: Understanding, of pure Judgement, and of pure Reason, which faculties
1773: are called pure because they are legislative _a priori_.
1774: 
1775: 
1776: IV. OF JUDGEMENT AS A FACULTY LEGISLATING _A PRIORI_
1777: 
1778: Judgement in general is the faculty of thinking the particular as
1779: contained under the Universal. If the universal (the rule, the
1780: principle, the law) be given, the Judgement which subsumes the
1781: particular under it (even if, as transcendental Judgement, it furnishes
1782: _a priori_, the conditions in conformity with which subsumption under
1783: that universal is alone possible) is _determinant_. But if only the
1784: particular be given for which the universal has to be found, the
1785: Judgement is merely _reflective_.
1786: 
1787: The determinant Judgement only subsumes under universal transcendental
1788: laws given by the Understanding; the law is marked out for it, _a
1789: priori_, and it has therefore no need to seek a law for itself in
1790: order to be able to subordinate the particular in nature to the
1791: universal.--But the forms of nature are so manifold, and there
1792: are so many modifications of the universal transcendental natural
1793: concepts left undetermined by the laws given, _a priori_, by the pure
1794: Understanding,--because these only concern the possibility of a nature
1795: in general (as an object of sense),--that there must be laws for these
1796: [forms] also. These, as empirical, may be contingent from the point
1797: of view of _our_ Understanding, and yet, if they are to be called
1798: laws (as the concept of a nature requires), they must be regarded as
1799: necessary in virtue of a principle of the unity of the manifold, though
1800: it be unknown to us.--The reflective Judgement, which is obliged to
1801: ascend from the particular in nature to the universal, requires on that
1802: account a principle that it cannot borrow from experience, because its
1803: function is to establish the unity of all empirical principles under
1804: higher ones, and hence to establish the possibility of their systematic
1805: subordination. Such a transcendental principle, then, the reflective
1806: Judgement can only give as a law from and to itself. It cannot derive
1807: it from outside (because then it would be the determinant Judgement);
1808: nor can it prescribe it to nature, because reflection upon the laws
1809: of nature adjusts itself by nature, and not nature by the conditions
1810: according to which we attempt to arrive at a concept of it which is
1811: quite contingent in respect of these.
1812: 
1813: This principle can be no other than the following: As universal laws
1814: of nature have their ground in our Understanding, which prescribes
1815: them to nature (although only according to the universal concept of
1816: it as nature); so particular empirical laws, in respect of what is in
1817: them left undetermined by these universal laws, must be considered in
1818: accordance with such a unity as they would have if an Understanding
1819: (although not our Understanding) had furnished them to our cognitive
1820: faculties, so as to make possible a system of experience according
1821: to particular laws of nature. Not as if, in this way, such an
1822: Understanding must be assumed as actual (for it is only our reflective
1823: Judgement to which this Idea serves as a principle--for reflecting, not
1824: for determining); but this faculty thus gives a law only to itself and
1825: not to nature.
1826: 
1827: Now the concept of an Object, so far as it contains the ground of
1828: the actuality of this Object, is the _purpose_; and the agreement
1829: of a thing with that constitution of things, which is only possible
1830: according to purposes, is called the _purposiveness_ of its form. Thus
1831: the principle of Judgement, in respect of the form of things of nature
1832: under empirical laws generally, is the _purposiveness of nature_ in its
1833: manifoldness. That is, nature is represented by means of this concept,
1834: as if an Understanding contained the ground of the unity of the
1835: manifold of its empirical laws.
1836: 
1837: The purposiveness of nature is therefore a particular concept, _a
1838: priori_, which has its origin solely in the reflective Judgement. For
1839: we cannot ascribe to natural products anything like a reference of
1840: nature in them to purposes; we can only use this concept to reflect
1841: upon such products in respect of the connexion of phenomena which is
1842: given in nature according to empirical laws. This concept is also quite
1843: different from practical purposiveness (in human art or in morals),
1844: though it is certainly thought according to the analogy of these last.
1845: 
1846: 
1847: V. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE FORMAL PURPOSIVENESS OF NATURE IS A
1848: TRANSCENDENTAL PRINCIPLE OF JUDGEMENT.
1849: 
1850: A transcendental principle is one by means of which is represented, _a
1851: priori_, the universal condition under which alone things can be in
1852: general Objects of our cognition. On the other hand, a principle is
1853: called metaphysical if it represents the _a priori_ condition under
1854: which alone Objects, whose concept must be empirically given, can be
1855: further determined _a priori_. Thus the principle of the cognition of
1856: bodies as substances, and as changeable substances, is transcendental,
1857: if thereby it is asserted that their changes must have a cause; it is
1858: metaphysical if it asserts that their changes must have an _external_
1859: cause. For in the former case bodies need only be thought by means
1860: of ontological predicates (pure concepts of Understanding), _e.g._
1861: substance, in order to cognise the proposition _a priori_; but in
1862: the latter case the empirical concept of a body (as a movable thing
1863: in space) must lie at the basis of the proposition, although once
1864: this basis has been laid down, it may be seen completely _a priori_
1865: that this latter predicate (motion only by external causes) belongs
1866: to body.--Thus, as I shall presently show, the principle of the
1867: purposiveness of nature (in the manifoldness of its empirical laws) is
1868: a transcendental principle. For the concept of Objects, so far as they
1869: are thought as standing under this principle, is only the pure concept
1870: of objects of possible empirical cognition in general and contains
1871: nothing empirical. On the other hand, the principle of practical
1872: purposiveness, which must be thought in the Idea of the _determination_
1873: of a free _will_, is a metaphysical principle; because the concept of a
1874: faculty of desire as a will must be given empirically (_i.e._ does not
1875: belong to transcendental predicates). Both principles are, however, not
1876: empirical, but _a priori_; because for the combination of the predicate
1877: with the empirical concept of the subject of their judgements no
1878: further experience is needed, but it can be apprehended completely _a
1879: priori_.
1880: 
1881: That the concept of a purposiveness of nature belongs to transcendental
1882: principles can be sufficiently seen from the maxims of the Judgement,
1883: which lie at the basis of the investigation of nature _a priori_,
1884: and yet do not go further than the possibility of experience, and
1885: consequently of the cognition of nature--not indeed nature in general,
1886: but nature as determined through a variety of particular laws. These
1887: maxims present themselves in the course of this science often enough,
1888: though in a scattered way, as sentences of metaphysical wisdom,
1889: whose necessity we cannot demonstrate from concepts. “Nature takes
1890: the shortest way (_lex parsimoniae_); at the same time it makes no
1891: leaps, either in the course of its changes or in the juxtaposition
1892: of specifically different forms (_lex continui in natura_); its
1893: great variety in empirical laws is yet unity under a few principles
1894: (_principia praeter necessitatem non sunt multiplicanda_),” etc.
1895: 
1896: If we propose to set forth the origin of these fundamental propositions
1897: and try to do so by the psychological method, we violate their sense.
1898: For they do not tell us what happens, _i.e._ by what rule our cognitive
1899: powers actually operate, and how we judge, but how we ought to judge;
1900: and this logical objective necessity does not emerge if the principles
1901: are merely empirical. Hence that purposiveness of nature for our
1902: cognitive faculties and their use, which is plainly apparent from them,
1903: is a transcendental principle of judgements, and needs therefore also a
1904: Transcendental Deduction, by means of which the ground for so judging
1905: must be sought in the sources of cognition _a priori_.
1906: 
1907: We find in the grounds of the possibility of an experience in the
1908: very first place something necessary, viz. the universal laws without
1909: which nature in general (as an object of sense) cannot be thought;
1910: and these rest upon the Categories, applied to the formal conditions
1911: of all intuition possible for us, so far as it is also given _a
1912: priori_. Now under these laws the Judgement is determinant, for it
1913: has nothing to do but to subsume under given laws. For example, the
1914: Understanding says that every change has its cause (universal law of
1915: nature); the transcendental Judgement has nothing further to do than
1916: to supply _a priori_ the condition of subsumption under the concept
1917: of the Understanding placed before it, _i.e._ the succession [in
1918: time] of the determinations of one and the same thing. For nature in
1919: general (as an object of possible experience) that law is cognised as
1920: absolutely necessary.--But now the objects of empirical cognition are
1921: determined in many other ways than by that formal time-condition,
1922: or, at least as far as we can judge _a priori_, are determinable.
1923: Hence specifically different natures can be causes in an infinite
1924: variety of ways, as well as in virtue of what they have in common
1925: as belonging to nature in general; and each of these modes must (in
1926: accordance with the concept of a cause in general) have its rule, which
1927: is a law and therefore brings necessity with it, although we do not
1928: at all comprehend this necessity, in virtue of the constitution and
1929: the limitations of our cognitive faculties. We must therefore think
1930: in nature, in respect of its merely empirical laws, a possibility of
1931: infinitely various empirical laws, which are, as far as our insight
1932: goes, contingent (cannot be cognised _a priori_), and in respect of
1933: which we judge nature, according to empirical laws and the possibility
1934: of the unity of experience (as a system according to empirical laws),
1935: to be contingent. But such a unity must be necessarily presupposed and
1936: assumed, for otherwise there would be no thoroughgoing connexion of
1937: empirical cognitions in a whole of experience. The universal laws of
1938: nature no doubt furnish such a connexion of things according to their
1939: kind as things of nature in general, but not specifically, as such
1940: particular beings of nature. Hence the Judgement must assume for its
1941: special use this principle _a priori_, that what in the particular
1942: (empirical) laws of nature is from the human point of view contingent,
1943: yet contains a unity of law in the combination of its manifold into an
1944: experience possible in itself--a unity not indeed to be fathomed by us,
1945: but yet thinkable. Consequently as the unity of law in a combination,
1946: which we cognise as contingent in itself, although in conformity with
1947: a necessary design (a need) of Understanding, is represented as the
1948: purposiveness of Objects (here of nature); so must the Judgement, which
1949: in respect of things under possible (not yet discovered) empirical
1950: laws is merely reflection, think of nature in respect of the latter
1951: according to _a principle of purposiveness_ for our cognitive faculty,
1952: which then is expressed in the above maxims of the Judgement. This
1953: transcendental concept of a purposiveness of nature is neither a
1954: natural concept nor a concept of freedom, because it ascribes nothing
1955: to the Object (of nature), but only represents the peculiar way in
1956: which we must proceed in reflection upon the objects of nature in
1957: reference to a thoroughly connected experience, and is consequently a
1958: subjective principle (maxim) of the Judgement. Hence, as if it were a
1959: lucky chance favouring our design, we are rejoiced (properly speaking,
1960: relieved of a want), if we meet with such systematic unity under merely
1961: empirical laws; although we must necessarily assume that there is such
1962: a unity without our comprehending it or being able to prove it.
1963: 
1964: In order to convince ourselves of the correctness of this Deduction
1965: of the concept before us, and the necessity of assuming it as a
1966: transcendental principle of cognition, just consider the magnitude of
1967: the problem. The problem, which lies _a priori_ in our Understanding,
1968: is to make a connected experience out of given perceptions of a nature
1969: containing at all events an infinite variety of empirical laws. The
1970: Understanding is, no doubt, in possession _a priori_ of universal laws
1971: of nature, without which nature could not be an object of experience;
1972: but it needs in addition a certain order of nature in its particular
1973: rules, which can only be empirically known and which are, as regards
1974: the Understanding, contingent. These rules, without which we could
1975: not proceed from the universal analogy of a possible experience in
1976: general to the particular, must be thought by it as laws (_i.e._ as
1977: necessary), for otherwise they would not constitute an order of nature;
1978: although their necessity can never be cognised or comprehended by
1979: it. Although, therefore, the Understanding can determine nothing _a
1980: priori_ in respect of Objects, it must, in order to trace out these
1981: empirical so-called laws, place at the basis of all reflection upon
1982: Objects an _a priori_ principle, viz. that a cognisable order of nature
1983: is possible in accordance with these laws. The following propositions
1984: express some such principle. There is in nature a subordination of
1985: genera and species comprehensible by us. Each one approximates to some
1986: other according to a common principle, so that a transition from one to
1987: another and so on to a higher genus may be possible. Though it seems at
1988: the outset unavoidable for our Understanding to assume different kinds
1989: of causality for the specific differences of natural operations, yet
1990: these different kinds may stand under a small number of principles,
1991: with the investigation of which we have to busy ourselves. This harmony
1992: of nature with our cognitive faculty is presupposed _a priori_ by the
1993: Judgement, on behalf of its reflection upon nature in accordance with
1994: its empirical laws; whilst the Understanding at the same time cognises
1995: it objectively as contingent, and it is only the Judgement that
1996: ascribes it to nature as a trancendental purposiveness (in relation to
1997: the cognitive faculty of the subject). For without this presupposition
1998: we should have no order of nature in accordance with empirical laws,
1999: and consequently no guiding thread for an experience ordered by these
2000: in all their variety, or for an investigation of them.
2001: 
2002: For it might easily be thought that, in spite of all the uniformity of
2003: natural things according to the universal laws, without which we should
2004: not have the form of an empirical cognition in general, the specific
2005: variety of the empirical laws of nature including their effects might
2006: yet be so great, that it would be impossible for our Understanding, to
2007: detect in nature a comprehensible order; to divide its products into
2008: genera and species, so as to use the principles which explain and make
2009: intelligible one for the explanation and comprehension of another; or
2010: out of such confused material (strictly we should say, so infinitely
2011: various and not to be measured by our faculty of comprehension) to make
2012: a connected experience.
2013: 
2014: The Judgement has therefore also in itself a principle _a priori_ of
2015: the possibility of nature, but only in a subjective aspect; by which
2016: it prescribes, not to nature (autonomy), but to itself (heautonomy)
2017: a law for its reflection upon nature. This we might call the _law of
2018: the specification of nature_ in respect of its empirical laws. The
2019: Judgement does not cognise this _a priori_ in nature, but assumes it
2020: on behalf of a natural order cognisable by our Understanding in the
2021: division which it makes of the universal laws of nature when it wishes
2022: to subordinate to these the variety of particular laws. If then we say
2023: that nature specifies its universal laws according to the principles of
2024: purposiveness for our cognitive faculty, _i.e._ in accordance with the
2025: necessary business of the human Understanding of finding the universal
2026: for the particular which perception offers it, and again of finding
2027: connexion for the diverse (which however is a universal for each
2028: species) in the unity of a principle,--we thus neither prescribe to
2029: nature a law, nor do we learn one from it by observation (although such
2030: a principle may be confirmed by this means). For it is not a principle
2031: of the determinant but merely of the reflective Judgement. We only
2032: require that, be nature disposed as it may as regards its universal
2033: laws, investigation into its empirical laws may be carried on in
2034: accordance with that principle and the maxims founded thereon, because
2035: it is only so far as that holds that we can make any progress with the
2036: use of our Understanding in experience, or gain knowledge.
2037: 
2038: 
2039: VI. OF THE COMBINATION OF THE FEELING OF PLEASURE WITH THE CONCEPT OF
2040: THE PURPOSIVENESS OF NATURE.
2041: 
2042: The thought harmony of nature in the variety of its particular laws
2043: with our need of finding universality of principles for it, must
2044: be judged as contingent in respect of our insight, but yet at the
2045: same time as indispensable for the needs of our Understanding, and
2046: consequently as a purposiveness by which nature is harmonised with our
2047: design, which, however, has only knowledge for its aim. The universal
2048: laws of the Understanding, which are at the same time laws of nature,
2049: are just as necessary (although arising from spontaneity) as the
2050: material laws of motion. Their production presupposes no design on the
2051: part of our cognitive faculty, because it is only by means of them
2052: that we, in the first place, attain a concept of what the cognition
2053: of things (of nature) is, and attribute them necessarily to nature as
2054: Object of our cognition in general. But, so far as we can see, it is
2055: contingent that the order of nature according to its particular laws,
2056: in all its variety and heterogeneity possibly at least transcending
2057: our comprehension, should be actually conformable to these [laws]. The
2058: discovery of this [order] is the business of the Understanding which
2059: is designedly borne towards a necessary purpose, viz. the bringing of
2060: unity of principles into nature, which purpose then the Judgement must
2061: ascribe to nature, because the Understanding cannot here prescribe any
2062: law to it.
2063: 
2064: The attainment of that design is bound up with the feeling of pleasure,
2065: and since the condition of this attainment is a representation
2066: _a priori_,--as here a principle for the reflective Judgement in
2067: general,--therefore the feeling of pleasure is determined by a ground
2068: _a priori_ and valid for every man, and that merely by the reference of
2069: the Object to the cognitive faculty, the concept of purposiveness here
2070: not having the least reference to the faculty of desire. It is thus
2071: quite distinguished from all practical purposiveness of nature.
2072: 
2073: In fact, although from the agreement of perceptions with laws in
2074: accordance with universal natural concepts (the categories), we do not
2075: and cannot find in ourselves the slightest effect upon the feeling of
2076: pleasure, because the Understanding necessarily proceeds according to
2077: its nature without any design; yet, on the other hand, the discovery
2078: that two or more empirical heterogeneous laws of nature may be combined
2079: under one principle comprehending them both, is the ground of a very
2080: marked pleasure, often even of an admiration, which does not cease,
2081: though we may be already quite familiar with the objects of it. We no
2082: longer find, it is true, any marked pleasure in the comprehensibility
2083: of nature and in the unity of its divisions into genera and species,
2084: whereby are possible all empirical concepts, through which we cognise
2085: it according to its particular laws. But this pleasure has certainly
2086: been present at one time, and it is only because the commonest
2087: experience would be impossible without it that it is gradually
2088: confounded with mere cognition and no longer arrests particular
2089: attention. There is then something in our judgements upon nature which
2090: makes us attentive to its purposiveness for our Understanding--an
2091: endeavour to bring, where possible, its dissimilar laws under higher
2092: ones, though still always empirical--and thus, if successful, makes
2093: us feel pleasure in that harmony of these with our cognitive faculty,
2094: which harmony we regard as merely contingent. On the other hand, a
2095: representation of nature would altogether displease, by which it
2096: should be foretold to us that in the smallest investigation beyond the
2097: commonest experience we should meet with a heterogeneity of its laws,
2098: which would make the union of its particular laws under universal
2099: empirical laws impossible for our Understanding. For this would
2100: contradict the principle of the subjectively-purposive specification of
2101: nature in its genera, and also of our reflective Judgement in respect
2102: of such principle.
2103: 
2104: This presupposition of the Judgement is, however, at the same time so
2105: indeterminate as to how far that ideal purposiveness of nature for
2106: our cognitive faculty should be extended, that if we were told that
2107: a deeper or wider knowledge of nature derived from observation must
2108: lead at last to a variety of laws, which no human Understanding could
2109: reduce to a principle, we should at once acquiesce. But still we more
2110: gladly listen to one who offers hope that the more we know nature
2111: internally, and can compare it with external members now unknown to
2112: us, the more simple shall we find it in its principles, and that the
2113: further our experience reaches the more uniform shall we find it amid
2114: the apparent heterogeneity of its empirical laws. For it is a mandate
2115: of our Judgement to proceed according to the principle of the harmony
2116: of nature with our cognitive faculty so far as that reaches, without
2117: deciding (because it is not the determinant Judgement which gives us
2118: this rule) whether or not it is bounded anywhere. For although in
2119: respect of the rational use of our cognitive faculty we can determine
2120: such bounds, this is not possible in the empirical field.
2121: 
2122: 
2123: VII. OF THE AESTHETICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE PURPOSIVENESS OF NATURE.
2124: 
2125: That which in the representation of an Object is merely subjective,
2126: _i.e._ which decides its reference to the subject, not to the object,
2127: is its aesthetical character; but that which serves or can be used
2128: for the determination of the object (for cognition), is its logical
2129: validity. In the cognition of an object of sense both references
2130: present themselves. In the sense-representation of external things
2131: the quality of space wherein we intuite them is the merely subjective
2132: [element] of my representation (by which it remains undecided what
2133: they may be in themselves as Objects), on account of which reference
2134: the object is thought thereby merely as phenomenon. But space,
2135: notwithstanding its merely subjective quality, is at the same time
2136: an ingredient in the cognition of things as phenomena. _Sensation_,
2137: again (_i.e._ external sensation), expresses the merely subjective
2138: [element] of our representations of external things, but it is also the
2139: proper material (reale) of them (by which something existing is given),
2140: just as space is the mere form _a priori_ of the possibility of their
2141: intuition. Nevertheless, however, sensation is also employed in the
2142: cognition of external Objects.
2143: 
2144: But the subjective [element] in a representation _which cannot be
2145: an ingredient of cognition_, is the _pleasure_ or _pain_ which is
2146: bound up with it; for through it I cognise nothing in the object of
2147: the representation, although it may be the effect of some cognition.
2148: Now the purposiveness of a thing, so far as it is represented in
2149: perception, is no characteristic of the Object itself (for such cannot
2150: be perceived), although it may be inferred from a cognition of things.
2151: The purposiveness, therefore, which precedes the cognition of an
2152: Object, and which, even without our wishing to use the representation
2153: of it for cognition, is, at the same time, immediately bound up
2154: with it, is that subjective [element] which cannot be an ingredient
2155: in cognition. Hence the object is only called purposive, when its
2156: representation is immediately combined with the feeling of pleasure;
2157: and this very representation is an aesthetical representation of
2158: purposiveness.--The only question is whether there is, in general, such
2159: a representation of purposiveness.
2160: 
2161: If pleasure is bound up with the mere apprehension (_apprehensio_) of
2162: the form of an object of intuition, without reference to a concept for
2163: a definite cognition, then the representation is thereby not referred
2164: to the Object, but simply to the subject; and the pleasure can express
2165: nothing else than its harmony with the cognitive faculties which come
2166: into play in the reflective Judgement, and so far as they are in play;
2167: and hence can only express a subjective formal purposiveness of the
2168: Object. For that apprehension of forms in the Imagination can never
2169: take place without the reflective Judgement, though undesignedly,
2170: at least comparing them with its faculty of referring intuitions to
2171: concepts. If now in this comparison the Imagination (as the faculty of
2172: _a priori_ intuitions) is placed by means of a given representation
2173: undesignedly in agreement with the Understanding, as the faculty of
2174: concepts, and thus a feeling of pleasure is aroused, the object must
2175: then be regarded as purposive for the reflective Judgement. Such a
2176: judgement is an aesthetical judgement upon the purposiveness of the
2177: Object, which does not base itself upon any present concept of the
2178: object, nor does it furnish any such. In the case of an object whose
2179: form (not the matter of its representation, as sensation), in the mere
2180: reflection upon it (without reference to any concept to be obtained
2181: of it), is judged as the ground of a pleasure in the representation
2182: of such an Object, this pleasure is judged as bound up with the
2183: representation necessarily; and, consequently, not only for the subject
2184: which apprehends this form, but for every judging being in general. The
2185: object is then called beautiful; and the faculty of judging by means
2186: of such a pleasure (and, consequently, with universal validity) is
2187: called Taste. For since the ground of the pleasure is placed merely in
2188: the form of the object for reflection in general--and, consequently,
2189: in no sensation of the object, and also without reference to any
2190: concept which anywhere involves design--it is only the conformity
2191: to law in the empirical use of the Judgement in general (unity of
2192: the Imagination with the Understanding) in the subject, with which
2193: the representation of the Object in reflection, whose conditions are
2194: universally valid _a priori_, harmonises. And since this harmony of the
2195: object with the faculties of the subject is contingent, it brings about
2196: the representation of its purposiveness in respect of the cognitive
2197: faculties of the subject.
2198: 
2199: Here now is a pleasure, which, like all pleasure or pain that is not
2200: produced through the concept of freedom (_i.e._ through the preceding
2201: determination of the higher faculties of desire by pure Reason), can
2202: never be comprehended from concepts, as necessarily bound up with the
2203: representation of an object. It must always be cognised as combined
2204: with this only by means of reflective perception; and, consequently,
2205: like all empirical judgements, it can declare no objective necessity
2206: and lay claim to no _a priori_ validity. But the judgement of taste
2207: also claims, as every other empirical judgement does, to be valid
2208: for every one; and in spite of its inner contingency this is always
2209: possible. The strange and irregular thing is that it is not an
2210: empirical concept, but a feeling of pleasure (consequently not a
2211: concept at all), which by the judgement of taste is attributed to every
2212: one,--just as if it were a predicate bound up with the cognition of the
2213: Object--and which is connected with the representation thereof.
2214: 
2215: A singular judgement of experience, _e.g._, when we perceive a moveable
2216: drop of water in an ice-crystal, may justly claim that every one
2217: else should find it the same; because we have formed this judgement,
2218: according to the universal conditions of the determinant faculty of
2219: Judgement, under the laws of a possible experience in general. Just
2220: in the same way he who feels pleasure in the mere reflection upon
2221: the form of an object without respect to any concept, although this
2222: judgement be empirical and singular, justly claims the agreement
2223: of every one; because the ground of this pleasure is found in the
2224: universal, although subjective, condition of reflective judgements,
2225: viz., the purposive harmony of an object (whether a product of nature
2226: or of art) with the mutual relations of the cognitive faculties (the
2227: Imagination and the Understanding), a harmony which is requisite for
2228: every empirical cognition. The pleasure, therefore, in the judgement
2229: of taste is dependent on an empirical representation, and cannot be
2230: bound up _a priori_ with any concept (we cannot determine _a priori_
2231: what object is or is not according to taste; that we must find out
2232: by experiment). But the pleasure is the determining ground of this
2233: judgement only because we are conscious that it rests merely on
2234: reflection and on the universal though only subjective conditions
2235: of the harmony of that reflection with the cognition of Objects in
2236: general, for which the form of the Object is purposive.
2237: 
2238: Thus the reason why judgements of taste according to their possibility
2239: are subjected to a Critique is that they presuppose a principle _a
2240: priori_, although this principle is neither one of cognition for the
2241: Understanding nor of practice for the Will, and therefore is not in any
2242: way determinant _a priori_.
2243: 
2244: Susceptibility to pleasure from reflection upon the forms of things (of
2245: Nature as well as of Art), indicates not only a purposiveness of the
2246: Objects in relation to the reflective Judgement, conformably to the
2247: concept of nature in the subject; but also conversely a purposiveness
2248: of the subject in respect of the objects according to their form or
2249: even their formlessness, in virtue of the concept of freedom. Hence
2250: the aesthetical judgement is not only related as a judgement of taste
2251: to the beautiful, but also as springing from a spiritual feeling is
2252: related to the _sublime_; and thus the Critique of the aesthetical
2253: Judgement must be divided into two corresponding sections.
2254: 
2255: 
2256: VIII. OF THE LOGICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE PURPOSIVENESS OF NATURE
2257: 
2258: Purposiveness may be represented in an object given in experience
2259: on a merely subjective ground, as the harmony of its form,--in the
2260: _apprehension_ (_apprehensio_) of it prior to any concept,--with the
2261: cognitive faculties, in order to unite the intuition with concepts
2262: for a cognition generally. Or it may be represented objectively as
2263: the harmony of the form of the object with the possibility of the
2264: thing itself, according to a concept of it which precedes and contains
2265: the ground of this form. We have seen that the representation of
2266: purposiveness of the first kind rests on the immediate pleasure
2267: in the form of the object in the mere reflection upon it. But the
2268: representation of purposiveness of the second kind, since it refers
2269: the form of the Object, not to the cognitive faculties of the subject
2270: in the apprehension of it, but to a definite cognition of the object
2271: under a given concept, has nothing to do with a feeling of pleasure in
2272: things, but only with the Understanding in its judgement upon them.
2273: If the concept of an object is given, the business of the Judgement
2274: in the use of the concept for cognition consists in _presentation_
2275: (_exhibitio_), _i.e._ in setting a corresponding intuition beside the
2276: concept. This may take place either through our own Imagination, as
2277: in Art when we realise a preconceived concept of an object which is
2278: a purpose of ours; or through Nature in its Technic (as in organised
2279: bodies) when we supply to it our concept of its purpose in order
2280: to judge of its products. In the latter case it is not merely the
2281: _purposiveness_ of nature in the form of the thing that is represented,
2282: but this its product is represented as a _natural purpose_.--Although
2283: our concept of a subjective purposiveness of nature in its forms
2284: according to empirical laws is not a concept of the Object, but only
2285: a principle of the Judgement for furnishing itself with concepts amid
2286: the immense variety of nature (and thus being able to ascertain its
2287: own position), yet we thus ascribe to nature as it were a regard to
2288: our cognitive faculty according to the analogy of purpose. Thus we can
2289: regard _natural beauty_ as the _presentation_ of the concept of the
2290: formal (merely subjective) purposiveness, and _natural purposes_ as
2291: the presentation of the concept of a real (objective) purposiveness.
2292: The former of these we judge of by Taste (aesthetically, by the medium
2293: of the feeling of pleasure), the latter by Understanding and Reason
2294: (logically, according to concepts).
2295: 
2296: On this is based the division of the Critique of Judgement into the
2297: Critique of _aesthetical_ and of _teleological_ Judgement. By the
2298: first we understand the faculty of judging of the formal purposiveness
2299: (otherwise called subjective) of Nature by means of the feeling of
2300: pleasure or pain; by the second the faculty of judging its real
2301: (objective) purposiveness by means of Understanding and Reason.
2302: 
2303: In a Critique of Judgement the part containing the aesthetical
2304: Judgement is essential, because this alone contains a principle
2305: which the Judgement places quite _a priori_ at the basis of its
2306: reflection upon nature; viz., the principle of a formal purposiveness
2307: of nature, according to its particular (empirical) laws, for our
2308: cognitive faculty, without which the Understanding could not find
2309: itself in nature. On the other hand no reason _a priori_ could be
2310: specified,--and even the possibility of a reason would not be apparent
2311: from the concept of nature as an object of experience whether general
2312: or particular,--why there should be objective purposes of nature,
2313: _i.e._ things which are only possible as natural purposes; but the
2314: Judgement, without containing such a principle _a priori_ in itself,
2315: in given cases (of certain products), in order to make use of the
2316: concept of purposes on behalf of Reason, would only contain the rule
2317: according to which that transcendental principle has already prepared
2318: the Understanding to apply to nature the concept of a purpose (at least
2319: as regards its form).
2320: 
2321: But the transcendental principle which represents a purposiveness of
2322: nature (in subjective reference to our cognitive faculty) in the form
2323: of a thing as a principle by which we judge of nature, leaves it quite
2324: undetermined where and in what cases I have to judge of a product
2325: according to a principle of purposiveness, and not rather according to
2326: universal natural laws. It leaves it to the _aesthetical_ Judgement
2327: to decide by taste the harmony of this product (of its form) with our
2328: cognitive faculty (so far as this decision rests not on any agreement
2329: with concepts but on feeling). On the other hand, the Judgement
2330: teleologically employed furnishes conditions determinately under which
2331: something (_e.g._ an organised body) is to be judged according to
2332: the Idea of a purpose of nature; but it can adduce no fundamental
2333: proposition from the concept of nature as an object of experience
2334: authorising it to ascribe to nature _a priori_ a reference to purposes,
2335: or even indeterminately to assume this of such products in actual
2336: experience. The reason of this is that we must have many particular
2337: experiences, and consider them under the unity of their principle, in
2338: order to be able to cognise, even empirically, objective purposiveness
2339: in a certain object.--The aesthetical Judgement is therefore a special
2340: faculty for judging of things according to a rule, but not according
2341: to concepts. The teleological Judgement is not a special faculty, but
2342: only the reflective Judgement in general, so far as it proceeds, as it
2343: always does in theoretical cognition, according to concepts; but in
2344: respect of certain objects of nature according to special principles,
2345: viz., of a merely reflective Judgement, and not of a Judgement that
2346: determines Objects. Thus as regards its application it belongs to
2347: the theoretical part of Philosophy; and on account of its special
2348: principles which are not determinant, as they must be in Doctrine, it
2349: must constitute a special part of the Critique. On the other hand, the
2350: aesthetical Judgement contributes nothing towards the knowledge of
2351: its objects, and thus must be reckoned as belonging to the criticism
2352: of the judging subject and its cognitive faculties, _only_ so far as
2353: they are susceptible of _a priori_ principles, of whatever other use
2354: (theoretical or practical) they may be. This is the propaedeutic of all
2355: Philosophy.
2356: 
2357: 
2358: IX. OF THE CONNEXION OF THE LEGISLATION OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THAT OF
2359: REASON BY MEANS OF THE JUDGEMENT
2360: 
2361: The Understanding legislates _a priori_ for nature as an Object of
2362: sense--for a theoretical knowledge of it in a possible experience.
2363: Reason legislates _a priori_ for freedom and its peculiar casuality;
2364: as the supersensible in the subject, for an unconditioned practical
2365: knowledge. The realm of the natural concept under the one legislation
2366: and that of the concept of freedom under the other are entirely removed
2367: from all mutual influence which they might have on one another (each
2368: according to its fundamental laws) by the great gulf that separates
2369: the supersensible from phenomena. The concept of freedom determines
2370: nothing in respect of the theoretical cognition of nature; and the
2371: natural concept determines nothing in respect of the practical laws of
2372: freedom. So far then it is not possible to throw a bridge from the one
2373: realm to the other. But although the determining grounds of causality
2374: according to the concept of freedom (and the practical rules which it
2375: contains) are not resident in nature, and the sensible cannot determine
2376: the supersensible in the subject, yet this is possible conversely (not,
2377: to be sure, in respect of the cognition of nature, but as regards
2378: the effects of the supersensible upon the sensible). This in fact is
2379: involved in the concept of a causality through freedom, the _effect_
2380: of which is to take place in the world according to its formal laws.
2381: The word _cause_, of course, when used of the supersensible only
2382: signifies the _ground_ which determines the causality of natural
2383: things to an effect in accordance with their proper natural laws,
2384: although harmoniously with the formal principle of the laws of
2385: Reason. Although the possibility of this cannot be comprehended, yet
2386: the objection of a contradiction alleged to be found in it can be
2387: sufficiently answered.[10]--The effect in accordance with the concept
2388: of freedom is the final purpose which (or its phenomenon in the world
2389: of sense) ought to exist; and the condition of the possibility of this
2390: is presupposed in nature (in the nature of the subject as a sensible
2391: being, that is, as man). The Judgement presupposes this _a priori_ and
2392: without reference to the practical; and thus furnishes the mediating
2393: concept between the concepts of nature and that of freedom. It makes
2394: possible the transition from the conformity to law in accordance with
2395: the former to the final purpose in accordance with the latter, and this
2396: by the concept of a _purposiveness_ of nature. For thus is cognised
2397: the possibility of the final purpose which alone can be actualised in
2398: nature in harmony with its laws.
2399: 
2400: The Understanding by the possibility of its _a priori_ laws for
2401: nature, gives a proof that nature is only cognised by us as phenomenon;
2402: and implies at the same time that it has a supersensible substrate,
2403: though it leaves this quite _undetermined_. The Judgement by its _a
2404: priori_ principle for the judging of nature according to its possible
2405: particular laws, makes the supersensible substrate (both in us and
2406: without us) _determinable by means of the intellectual faculty_. But
2407: the Reason by its practical _a priori_ law _determines_ it; and thus
2408: the Judgement makes possible the transition from the realm of the
2409: concept of nature to that of the concept of freedom.
2410: 
2411: As regards the faculties of the soul in general, in their higher
2412: aspect, as containing an autonomy; the Understanding is that which
2413: contains the _constitutive_ principles _a priori_ for the _cognitive
2414: faculty_ (the theoretical cognition of nature). For the _feeling of
2415: pleasure and pain_ there is the Judgement, independently of concepts
2416: and sensations which relate to the determination of the faculty of
2417: desire and can thus be immediately practical. For the _faculty of
2418: desire_ there is the Reason which is practical without the mediation
2419: of any pleasure whatever. It determines for the faculty of desire,
2420: as a superior faculty, the final purpose which carries with it the
2421: pure intellectual satisfaction in the Object.--The concept formed by
2422: Judgement of a purposiveness of nature belongs to natural concepts,
2423: but only as a regulative principle of the cognitive faculty; although
2424: the aesthetical judgement upon certain objects (of Nature or Art)
2425: which occasions it is, in respect of the feeling of pleasure or pain,
2426: a constitutive principle. The spontaneity in the play of the cognitive
2427: faculties, the harmony of which contains the ground of this pleasure,
2428: makes the above concept [of the purposiveness of nature] fit to be the
2429: mediating link between the realm of the natural concept and that of the
2430: concept of freedom in its effects; whilst at the same time it promotes
2431: the sensibility of the mind for moral feeling.--The following table may
2432: facilitate the review of all the higher faculties according to their
2433: systematic unity.[11]

2475: 
2476: OF THE JUDGEMENT OF TASTE[12] ACCORDING TO QUALITY
2477: 
2478: 
2479: § 1. _The judgement of taste is aesthetical_
2480: 
2481: In order to decide whether anything is beautiful or not, we refer the
2482: representation, not by the Understanding to the Object for cognition
2483: but, by the Imagination (perhaps in conjunction with the Understanding)
2484: to the subject, and its feeling of pleasure or pain. The judgement of
2485: taste is therefore not a judgement of cognition, and is consequently
2486: not logical but aesthetical, by which we understand that whose
2487: determining ground can be _no other than subjective_. Every reference
2488: of representations, even that of sensations, may be objective (and
2489: then it signifies the real in an empirical representation); save only
2490: the reference to the feeling of pleasure and pain, by which nothing in
2491: the Object is signified, but through which there is a feeling in the
2492: subject, as it is affected by the representation.
2493: 
2494: To apprehend a regular, purposive building by means of one’s
2495: cognitive faculty (whether in a clear or a confused way of
2496: representation) is something quite different from being conscious of
2497: this representation as connected with the sensation of satisfaction.
2498: Here the representation is altogether referred to the subject and
2499: to its feeling of life, under the name of the feeling of pleasure
2500: or pain. This establishes a quite separate faculty of distinction
2501: and of judgement, adding nothing to cognition, but only comparing
2502: the given representation in the subject with the whole faculty of
2503: representations, of which the mind is conscious in the feeling of
2504: its state. Given representations in a judgement can be empirical
2505: (consequently, aesthetical); but the judgement which is formed by means
2506: of them is logical, provided they are referred in the judgement to the
2507: Object. Conversely, if the given representations are rational, but are
2508: referred in a judgement simply to the subject (to its feeling), the
2509: judgement is so far always aesthetical.
2510: 
2511: 
2512: § 2. _The satisfaction which determines the judgement of taste is
2513: disinterested_
2514: 
2515: The satisfaction which we combine with the representation of the
2516: existence of an object is called interest. Such satisfaction always
2517: has reference to the faculty of desire, either as its determining
2518: ground or as necessarily connected with its determining ground. Now
2519: when the question is if a thing is beautiful, we do not want to know
2520: whether anything depends or can depend on the existence of the thing
2521: either for myself or for any one else, but how we judge it by mere
2522: observation (intuition or reflection). If any one asks me if I find
2523: that palace beautiful which I see before me, I may answer: I do not
2524: like things of that kind which are made merely to be stared at. Or I
2525: can answer like that Iroquois _sachem_ who was pleased in Paris by
2526: nothing more than by the cook-shops. Or again after the manner of
2527: _Rousseau_ I may rebuke the vanity of the great who waste the sweat of
2528: the people on such superfluous things. In fine I could easily convince
2529: myself that if I found myself on an uninhabited island without the
2530: hope of ever again coming among men, and could conjure up just such
2531: a splendid building by my mere wish, I should not even give myself
2532: the trouble if I had a sufficiently comfortable hut. This may all be
2533: admitted and approved; but we are not now talking of this. We wish
2534: only to know if this mere representation of the object is accompanied
2535: in me with satisfaction, however indifferent I may be as regards the
2536: existence of the object of this representation. We easily see that
2537: in saying it is _beautiful_ and in showing that I have taste, I am
2538: concerned, not with that in which I depend on the existence of the
2539: object, but with that which I make out of this representation in
2540: myself. Every one must admit that a judgement about beauty, in which
2541: the least interest mingles, is very partial and is not a pure judgement
2542: of taste. We must not be in the least prejudiced in favour of the
2543: existence of the things, but be quite indifferent in this respect, in
2544: order to play the judge in things of taste.
2545: 
2546: We cannot, however, better elucidate this proposition, which is of
2547: capital importance, than by contrasting the pure disinterested[13]
2548: satisfaction in judgements of taste, with that which is bound up with
2549: an interest, especially if we can at the same time be certain that
2550: there are no other kinds of interest than those which are now to be
2551: specified.
2552: 
2553: 
2554: § 3. _The satisfaction in the_ PLEASANT _is bound up with interest_
2555: 
2556: _That which pleases the senses in sensation is_ PLEASANT. Here the
2557: opportunity presents itself of censuring a very common confusion of
2558: the double sense which the word sensation can have, and of calling
2559: attention to it. All satisfaction (it is said or thought) is itself
2560: sensation (of a pleasure). Consequently everything that pleases is
2561: pleasant because it pleases (and according to its different degrees
2562: or its relations to other pleasant sensations it is _agreeable_,
2563: _lovely_, _delightful_, _enjoyable_, etc.). But if this be admitted,
2564: then impressions of Sense which determine the inclination, fundamental
2565: propositions of Reason which determine the Will, mere reflective forms
2566: of intuition which determine the Judgement, are quite the same, as
2567: regards the effect upon the feeling of pleasure. For this would be
2568: pleasantness in the sensation of one’s state, and since in the end all
2569: the operations of our faculties must issue in the practical and unite
2570: in it as their goal, we could suppose no other way of estimating things
2571: and their worth than that which consists in the gratification that
2572: they promise. It is of no consequence at all how this is attained, and
2573: since then the choice of means alone could make a difference, men could
2574: indeed blame one another for stupidity and indiscretion, but never for
2575: baseness and wickedness. For all, each according to his own way of
2576: seeing things, seek one goal, that is, gratification.
2577: 
2578: If a determination of the feeling of pleasure or pain is called
2579: sensation, this expression signifies something quite different from
2580: what I mean when I call the representation of a thing (by sense, as a
2581: receptivity belonging to the cognitive faculty) sensation. For in the
2582: latter case the representation is referred to the Object, in the former
2583: simply to the subject, and is available for no cognition whatever, not
2584: even for that by which the subject _cognises_ itself.
2585: 
2586: In the above elucidation we understand by the word sensation,
2587: an objective representation of sense; and in order to avoid
2588: misinterpretation, we shall call that, which must always remain merely
2589: subjective and can constitute absolutely no representation of an
2590: object, by the ordinary term “feeling.” The green colour of the meadows
2591: belongs to _objective_ sensation, as a perception of an object of
2592: sense; the pleasantness of this belongs to _subjective_ sensation by
2593: which no object is represented, _i.e._ to feeling, by which the object
2594: is considered as an Object of satisfaction (which does not furnish a
2595: cognition of it).
2596: 
2597: Now that a judgement about an object, by which I describe it as
2598: pleasant, expresses an interest in it, is plain from the fact that by
2599: sensation it excites a desire for objects of that kind; consequently
2600: the satisfaction presupposes not the mere judgement about it, but the
2601: relation of its existence to my state, so far as this is affected
2602: by such an Object. Hence we do not merely say of the pleasant, _it
2603: pleases_; but, _it gratifies_. I give to it no mere approval, but
2604: inclination is aroused by it; and in the case of what is pleasant
2605: in the most lively fashion, there is no judgement at all upon the
2606: character of the Object, for those who always lay themselves out only
2607: for enjoyment (for that is the word describing intense gratification)
2608: would fain dispense with all judgement.
2609: 
2610: 
2611: § 4. _The satisfaction in the_ GOOD _is bound up with interest_
2612: 
2613: Whatever by means of Reason pleases through the mere concept is GOOD.
2614: That which pleases only as a means we call _good for something_ (the
2615: useful); but that which pleases for itself is _good in itself_. In both
2616: there is always involved the concept of a purpose, and consequently
2617: the relation of Reason to the (at least possible) volition, and thus a
2618: satisfaction in the _presence_ of an Object or an action, _i.e._ some
2619: kind of interest.
2620: 
2621: In order to find anything good, I must always know what sort of a
2622: thing the object ought to be, _i.e._ I must have a concept of it. But
2623: there is no need of this, to find a thing beautiful. Flowers, free
2624: delineations, outlines intertwined with one another without design
2625: and called foliage, have no meaning, depend on no definite concept,
2626: and yet they please. The satisfaction in the beautiful must depend
2627: on the reflection upon an object, leading to any concept (however
2628: indefinite); and it is thus distinguished from the pleasant which rests
2629: entirely upon sensation.
2630: 
2631: It is true, the Pleasant seems in many cases to be the same as the
2632: Good. Thus people are accustomed to say that all gratification
2633: (especially if it lasts) is good in itself; which is very much the
2634: same as to say that lasting pleasure and the good are the same. But
2635: we can soon see that this is merely a confusion of words; for the
2636: concepts which properly belong to these expressions can in no way be
2637: interchanged. The pleasant, which, as such, represents the object
2638: simply in relation to Sense, must first be brought by the concept of
2639: a purpose under principles of Reason, in order to call it good, as an
2640: object of the Will. But that there is [involved] a quite different
2641: relation to satisfaction in calling that which gratifies at the same
2642: time _good_, may be seen from the fact that in the case of the good the
2643: question always is, whether it is mediately or immediately good (useful
2644: or good in itself); but on the contrary in the case of the pleasant
2645: there can be no question about this at all, for the word always
2646: signifies something which pleases immediately. (The same is applicable
2647: to what I call beautiful.)
2648: 
2649: Even in common speech men distinguish the Pleasant from the Good.
2650: Of a dish which stimulates the taste by spices and other condiments
2651: we say unhesitatingly that it is pleasant, though it is at the same
2652: time admitted not to be good; for though it immediately _delights_
2653: the senses, yet mediately, _i.e._ considered by Reason which looks to
2654: the after results, it displeases. Even in the judging of health we
2655: may notice this distinction. It is immediately pleasant to every one
2656: possessing it (at least negatively, _i.e._ as the absence of all bodily
2657: pains). But in order to say that it is good, it must be considered
2658: by Reason with reference to purposes; viz. that it is a state which
2659: makes us fit for all our business. Finally in respect of happiness
2660: every one believes himself entitled to describe the greatest sum of
2661: the pleasantnesses of life (as regards both their number and their
2662: duration) as a true, even as the highest, good. However Reason is
2663: opposed to this. Pleasantness is enjoyment. And if we were concerned
2664: with this alone, it would be foolish to be scrupulous as regards the
2665: means which procure it for us, or [to care] whether it is obtained
2666: passively by the bounty of nature or by our own activity and work.
2667: But Reason can never be persuaded that the existence of a man who
2668: merely lives for _enjoyment_ (however busy he may be in this point of
2669: view), has a worth in itself; even if he at the same time is conducive
2670: as a means to the best enjoyment of others, and shares in all their
2671: gratifications by sympathy. Only what he does, without reference to
2672: enjoyment, in full freedom and independently of what nature can procure
2673: for him passively, gives an [absolute[14]] worth to his being, as the
2674: existence of a person; and happiness, with the whole abundance of its
2675: pleasures, is far from being an unconditioned good.[15]
2676: 
2677: However, notwithstanding all this difference between the pleasant and
2678: the good, they both agree in this that they are always bound up with an
2679: interest in their object. [This is true] not only of the pleasant(§ 3),
2680: and the mediate good (the useful) which is pleasing as a means towards
2681: pleasantness somewhere, but also of that which is good absolutely and
2682: in every aspect, viz. moral good, which brings with it the highest
2683: interest. For the good is the Object of will (_i.e._ of a faculty of
2684: desire determined by Reason). But to will something, and to have a
2685: satisfaction in its existence, _i.e._ to take an interest in it, are
2686: identical.
2687: 
2688: 
2689: § 5. _Comparison of the three specifically different kinds of
2690: satisfaction_
2691: 
2692: The pleasant and the good have both a reference to the faculty
2693: of desire; and they bring with them--the former a satisfaction
2694: pathologically conditioned (by impulses, _stimuli_)--the latter a
2695: pure practical satisfaction, which is determined not merely by the
2696: representation of the object, but also by the represented connexion
2697: of the subject with the existence of the object. [It is not merely
2698: the object that pleases, but also its existence.[16]] On the other
2699: hand, the judgement of taste is merely _contemplative_; _i.e._ it is
2700: a judgement which, indifferent as regards the being of an object,
2701: compares its character with the feeling of pleasure and pain. But this
2702: contemplation itself is not directed to concepts; for the judgement of
2703: taste is not a cognitive judgement (either theoretical or practical),
2704: and thus is not _based_ on concepts, nor has it concepts as its
2705: _purpose_.
2706: 
2707: The Pleasant, the Beautiful, and the Good, designate then, three
2708: different relations of representations to the feeling of pleasure and
2709: pain, in reference to which we distinguish from each other objects or
2710: methods of representing them. And the expressions corresponding to
2711: each, by which we mark our complacency in them, are not the same. That
2712: which GRATIFIES a man is called _pleasant_; that which merely PLEASES
2713: him is _beautiful_; that which is ESTEEMED [or _approved_[17]] by
2714: him, _i.e._ that to which he accords an objective worth, is _good_.
2715: Pleasantness concerns irrational animals also; but Beauty only
2716: concerns men, _i.e._ animal, but still rational, beings--not merely
2717: _quâ_ rational (_e.g._ spirits), but _quâ_ animal also; and the Good
2718: concerns every rational being in general. This is a proposition which
2719: can only be completely established and explained in the sequel. We may
2720: say that of all these three kinds of satisfaction, that of taste in
2721: the Beautiful is alone a disinterested and _free_ satisfaction; for no
2722: interest, either of Sense or of Reason, here forces our assent. Hence
2723: we may say of satisfaction that it is related in the three aforesaid
2724: cases to _inclination_, to _favour_, or to _respect_. Now _favour_ is
2725: the only free satisfaction. An object of inclination, and one that
2726: is proposed to our desire by a law of Reason, leave us no freedom in
2727: forming for ourselves anywhere an object of pleasure. All interest
2728: presupposes or generates a want; and, as the determining ground of
2729: assent, it leaves the judgement about the object no longer free.
2730: 
2731: As regards the interest of inclination in the case of the Pleasant,
2732: every one says that hunger is the best sauce, and everything that is
2733: eatable is relished by people with a healthy appetite; and thus a
2734: satisfaction of this sort does not indicate choice directed by taste.
2735: It is only when the want is appeased that we can distinguish which of
2736: many men has or has not taste. In the same way there may be manners
2737: (conduct) without virtue, politeness without goodwill, decorum without
2738: modesty, etc. For where the moral law speaks there is no longer,
2739: objectively, a free choice as regards what is to be done; and to
2740: display taste in its fulfilment (or in judging of another’s fulfilment
2741: of it) is something quite different from manifesting the moral attitude
2742: of thought. For this involves a command and generates a want, whilst
2743: moral taste only plays with the objects of satisfaction, without
2744: attaching itself to one of them.
2745: 
2746: 
2747: EXPLANATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL RESULTING FROM THE FIRST MOMENT
2748: 
2749: _Taste_ is the faculty of judging of an object or a method of
2750: representing it by an _entirely disinterested_ satisfaction
2751: or dissatisfaction. The object of such satisfaction is called
2752: _beautiful_.[18]
2753: 
2754: 
2755: 
2756: 
2757: SECOND MOMENT
2758: 
2759: OF THE JUDGEMENT OF TASTE, VIZ. ACCORDING TO QUANTITY
2760: 
2761: 
2762: § 6. _The beautiful is that which apart from concepts is represented as
2763: the object of a universal satisfaction_
2764: 
2765: This explanation of the beautiful can be derived from the preceding
2766: explanation of it as the object of an entirely disinterested
2767: satisfaction. For the fact of which every one is conscious, that the
2768: satisfaction is for him quite disinterested, implies in his judgement a
2769: ground of satisfaction for every one. For since it does not rest on any
2770: inclination of the subject (nor upon any other premeditated interest),
2771: but since he who judges feels himself quite _free_ as regards the
2772: satisfaction which he attaches to the object, he cannot find the ground
2773: of this satisfaction in any private conditions connected with his own
2774: subject; and hence it must be regarded as grounded on what he can
2775: presuppose in every other man. Consequently he must believe that he has
2776: reason for attributing a similar satisfaction to every one. He will
2777: therefore speak of the beautiful, as if beauty were a characteristic
2778: of the object and the judgement logical (constituting a cognition of
2779: the Object by means of concepts of it); although it is only aesthetical
2780: and involves merely a reference of the representation of the object to
2781: the subject. For it has this similarity to a logical judgement that we
2782: can presuppose its validity for every one. But this universality cannot
2783: arise from concepts; for from concepts there is no transition to the
2784: feeling of pleasure or pain (except in pure practical laws, which bring
2785: an interest with them such as is not bound up with the pure judgement
2786: of taste). Consequently the judgement of taste, accompanied with the
2787: consciousness of separation from all interest, must claim validity for
2788: every one, without this universality depending on Objects. That is,
2789: there must be bound up with it a title to subjective universality.
2790: 
2791: 
2792: § 7. _Comparison of the Beautiful with the Pleasant and the Good by
2793: means of the above characteristic_
2794: 
2795: As regards the Pleasant every one is content that his judgement, which
2796: he bases upon private feeling, and by which he says of an object that
2797: it pleases him, should be limited merely to his own person. Thus he
2798: is quite contented that if he says “Canary wine is pleasant,” another
2799: man may correct his expression and remind him that he ought to say “It
2800: is pleasant _to me_.” And this is the case not only as regards the
2801: taste of the tongue, the palate, and the throat, but for whatever is
2802: pleasant to any one’s eyes and ears. To one violet colour is soft and
2803: lovely, to another it is faded and dead. One man likes the tone of wind
2804: instruments, another that of strings. To strive here with the design of
2805: reproving as incorrect another man’s judgement which is different from
2806: our own, as if the judgements were logically opposed, would be folly.
2807: As regards the pleasant therefore the fundamental proposition is valid,
2808: _every one has his own taste_ (the taste of Sense).
2809: 
2810: The case is quite different with the Beautiful. It would (on the
2811: contrary) be laughable if a man who imagined anything to his own taste,
2812: thought to justify himself by saying: “This object (the house we see,
2813: the coat that person wears, the concert we hear, the poem submitted
2814: to our judgement) is beautiful _for me_.” For he must not call it
2815: _beautiful_ if it merely pleases himself. Many things may have for
2816: him charm and pleasantness; no one troubles himself at that; but if
2817: he gives out anything as beautiful, he supposes in others the same
2818: satisfaction--he judges not merely for himself, but for every one,
2819: and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things. Hence he says
2820: “the _thing_ is beautiful”; and he does not count on the agreement of
2821: others with this his judgement of satisfaction, because he has found
2822: this agreement several times before, but he _demands_ it of them. He
2823: blames them if they judge otherwise and he denies them taste, which he
2824: nevertheless requires from them. Here then we cannot say that each man
2825: has his own particular taste. For this would be as much as to say that
2826: there is no taste whatever; _i.e._ no aesthetical judgement, which can
2827: make a rightful claim upon every one’s assent.
2828: 
2829: At the same time we find as regards the Pleasant that there is an
2830: agreement among men in their judgements upon it, in regard to which
2831: we deny Taste to some and attribute it to others; by this not meaning
2832: one of our organic senses, but a faculty of judging in respect of the
2833: pleasant generally. Thus we say of a man who knows how to entertain
2834: his guests with pleasures (of enjoyment for all the senses), so that
2835: they are all pleased, “he has taste.” But here the universality is only
2836: taken comparatively; and there emerge rules which are only _general_
2837: (like all empirical ones), and not _universal_; which latter the
2838: judgement of Taste upon the beautiful undertakes or lays claim to. It
2839: is a judgement in reference to sociability, so far as this rests on
2840: empirical rules. In respect of the Good it is true that judgements make
2841: rightful claim to validity for every one; but the Good is represented
2842: only _by means of a concept_ as the Object of a universal satisfaction,
2843: which is the case neither with the Pleasant nor with the Beautiful.
2844: 
2845: 
2846: § 8. _The universality of the satisfaction is represented in a
2847: judgement of Taste only as subjective_
2848: 
2849: This particular determination of the universality of an aesthetical
2850: judgement, which is to be met with in a judgement of taste, is
2851: noteworthy, not indeed for the logician, but for the transcendental
2852: philosopher. It requires no small trouble to discover its origin, but
2853: we thus detect a property of our cognitive faculty which without this
2854: analysis would remain unknown.
2855: 
2856: First, we must be fully convinced of the fact that in a judgement
2857: of taste (about the Beautiful) the satisfaction in the object is
2858: imputed to _every one_, without being based on a concept (for then
2859: it would be the Good). Further, this claim to universal validity so
2860: essentially belongs to a judgement by which we describe anything as
2861: _beautiful_, that if this were not thought in it, it would never come
2862: into our thoughts to use the expression at all, but everything which
2863: pleases without a concept would be counted as pleasant. In respect
2864: of the latter every one has his own opinion; and no one assumes, in
2865: another, agreement with his judgement of taste, which is always the
2866: case in a judgement of taste about beauty. I may call the first the
2867: taste of Sense, the second the taste of Reflection; so far as the
2868: first lays down mere private judgements, and the second judgements
2869: supposed to be generally valid (public), but in both cases aesthetical
2870: (not practical) judgements about an object merely in respect of the
2871: relation of its representation to the feeling of pleasure and pain.
2872: Now here is something strange. As regards the taste of Sense not only
2873: does experience show that its judgement (of pleasure or pain connected
2874: with anything) is not valid universally, but every one is content not
2875: to impute agreement with it to others (although actually there is
2876: often found a very extended concurrence in these judgements). On the
2877: other hand, the taste of Reflection has its claim to the universal
2878: validity of its judgements (about the beautiful) rejected often
2879: enough, as experience teaches; although it may find it possible (as it
2880: actually does) to represent judgements which can demand this universal
2881: agreement. In fact for each of its judgements of taste it imputes
2882: this to every one, without the persons that judge disputing as to the
2883: possibility of such a claim; although in particular cases they cannot
2884: agree as to the correct application of this faculty.
2885: 
2886: Here we must, in the first place, remark that a universality which
2887: does not rest on concepts of Objects (not even on empirical ones) is
2888: not logical but aesthetical, _i.e._ it involves no objective quantity
2889: of the judgement but only that which is subjective. For this I use
2890: the expression _general validity_ which signifies the validity of the
2891: reference of a representation, not to the cognitive faculty but, to the
2892: feeling of pleasure and pain for every subject. (We can avail ourselves
2893: also of the same expression for the logical quantity of the judgement,
2894: if only we prefix _objective_ to “universal validity,” to distinguish
2895: it from that which is merely subjective and aesthetical.)
2896: 
2897: A judgement with _objective universal validity_ is also always valid
2898: subjectively; _i.e._ if the judgement holds for everything contained
2899: under a given concept, it holds also for every one who represents an
2900: object by means of this concept. But from a _subjective universal
2901: validity_, _i.e._ aesthetical and resting on no concept, we cannot
2902: infer that which is logical; because that kind of judgement does not
2903: extend to the Object. Hence the aesthetical universality which is
2904: ascribed to a judgement must be of a particular kind, because it does
2905: not unite the predicate of beauty with the concept of the _Object_,
2906: considered in its whole logical sphere, and yet extends it to the whole
2907: sphere of judging persons.
2908: 
2909: In respect of logical quantity all judgements of taste are _singular_
2910: judgements. For because I must refer the object immediately to my
2911: feeling of pleasure and pain, and that not by means of concepts, they
2912: cannot have the quantity of objective generally valid judgements.
2913: Nevertheless if the singular representation of the Object of the
2914: judgement of taste in accordance with the conditions determining the
2915: latter, were transformed by comparison into a concept, a logically
2916: universal judgement could result therefrom. _E.g._ I describe by
2917: a judgement of taste the rose, that I see, as beautiful. But the
2918: judgement which results from the comparison of several singular
2919: judgements, “Roses in general are beautiful” is no longer described
2920: simply as aesthetical, but as a logical judgement based on an
2921: aesthetical one. Again the judgement “The rose is pleasant” (to smell)
2922: is, although aesthetical and singular, not a judgement of Taste but
2923: of Sense. It is distinguished from the former by the fact that the
2924: judgement of Taste carries with it an _aesthetical quantity_ of
2925: universality, _i.e._ of validity for every one; which cannot be found
2926: in a judgement about the Pleasant. It is only judgements about the Good
2927: which--although they also determine satisfaction in an object,--have
2928: logical and not merely aesthetical universality; for they are valid of
2929: the Object, as cognitive of it, and thus are valid for every one.
2930: 
2931: If we judge Objects merely according to concepts, then all
2932: representation of beauty is lost. Thus there can be no rule according
2933: to which any one is to be forced to recognise anything as beautiful.
2934: We cannot press [upon others] by the aid of any reasons or fundamental
2935: propositions our judgement that a coat, a house, or a flower is
2936: beautiful. We wish to submit the Object to our own eyes, as if the
2937: satisfaction in it depended on sensation; and yet if we then call the
2938: object beautiful, we believe that we speak with a universal voice, and
2939: we claim the assent of every one, although on the contrary all private
2940: sensation can only decide for the observer himself and his satisfaction.
2941: 
2942: We may see now that in the judgement of taste nothing is postulated but
2943: such a _universal voice_, in respect of the satisfaction without the
2944: intervention of concepts; and thus the _possibility_ of an aesthetical
2945: judgement that can, at the same time, be regarded as valid for every
2946: one. The judgement of taste itself does not _postulate_ the agreement
2947: of every one (for that can only be done by a logically universal
2948: judgement because it can adduce reasons); it only _imputes_ this
2949: agreement to every one, as a case of the rule in respect of which it
2950: expects, not confirmation by concepts, but assent from others. The
2951: universal voice is, therefore, only an Idea (we do not yet inquire
2952: upon what it rests). It may be uncertain whether or not the man, who
2953: believes that he is laying down a judgement of taste, is, as a matter
2954: of fact, judging in conformity with that Idea; but that he refers his
2955: judgement thereto, and, consequently, that it is intended to be a
2956: judgement of taste, he announces by the expression “beauty.” He can
2957: be quite certain of this for himself by the mere consciousness of the
2958: separation of everything belonging to the Pleasant and the Good from
2959: the satisfaction which is left; and this is all for which he promises
2960: himself the agreement of every one--a claim which would be justifiable
2961: under these conditions, provided only he did not often make mistakes,
2962: and thus lay down an erroneous judgement of taste.
2963: 
2964: 
2965: § 9. _Investigation of the question whether in the judgement of taste
2966: the feeling of pleasure precedes or follows the judging of the object_
2967: 
2968: The solution of this question is the key to the Critique of Taste, and
2969: so is worthy of all attention.
2970: 
2971: If the pleasure in the given object precedes, and it is only its
2972: universal communicability that is to be acknowledged in the judgement
2973: of taste about the representation of the object, there would be a
2974: contradiction. For such pleasure would be nothing different from the
2975: mere pleasantness in the sensation, and so in accordance with its
2976: nature could have only private validity, because it is immediately
2977: dependent on the representation through which the object _is given_.
2978: 
2979: Hence, it is the universal capability of communication of the mental
2980: state in the given representation which, as the subjective condition of
2981: the judgement of taste, must be fundamental, and must have the pleasure
2982: in the object as its consequent. But nothing can be universally
2983: communicated except cognition and representation, so far as it belongs
2984: to cognition. For it is only thus that this latter can be objective;
2985: and only through this has it a universal point of reference, with
2986: which the representative power of every one is compelled to harmonise.
2987: If the determining ground of our judgement as to this universal
2988: communicability of the representation is to be merely subjective,
2989: _i.e._ is conceived independently of any concept of the object, it can
2990: be nothing else than the state of mind, which is to be met with in the
2991: relation of our representative powers to each other, so far as they
2992: refer a given representation to _cognition in general_.
2993: 
2994: The cognitive powers, which are involved by this representation,
2995: are here in free play, because no definite concept limits them to a
2996: particular[19] rule of cognition. Hence, the state of mind in this
2997: representation must be a feeling of the free play of the representative
2998: powers in a given representation with reference to a cognition in
2999: general. Now a representation by which an object is given, that is
3000: to become a cognition in general, requires _Imagination_, for the
3001: gathering together the manifold of intuition, and _Understanding_, for
3002: the unity of the concept uniting the representations. This state of
3003: _free play_ of the cognitive faculties in a representation by which an
3004: object is given, must be universally communicable; because cognition,
3005: as the determination of the Object with which given representations
3006: (in whatever subject) are to agree, is the only kind of representation
3007: which is valid for every one.
3008: 
3009: The subjective universal communicability of the mode of representation
3010: in a judgement of taste, since it is to be possible without
3011: presupposing a definite concept, can refer to nothing else than the
3012: state of mind in the free play of the Imagination and the Understanding
3013: (so far as they agree with each other, as is requisite for _cognition
3014: in general_). We are conscious that this subjective relation, suitable
3015: for cognition in general, must be valid for every one, and thus must
3016: be universally communicable, just as if it were a definite cognition,
3017: resting always on that relation as its subjective condition.
3018: 
3019: This merely subjective (aesthetical) judging of the object, or of the
3020: representation by which it is given, precedes the pleasure in it,
3021: and is the ground of this pleasure in the harmony of the cognitive
3022: faculties; but on the universality of the subjective conditions for
3023: judging of objects is alone based the universal subjective validity of
3024: the satisfaction bound up by us with the representation of the object
3025: that we call beautiful.
3026: 
3027: The power of communicating one’s state of mind, even though only in
3028: respect of the cognitive faculties, carries a pleasure with it, as we
3029: can easily show from the natural propension of man towards sociability
3030: (empirical and psychological). But this is not enough for our design.
3031: The pleasure that we feel is, in a judgement of taste, necessarily
3032: imputed by us to every one else; as if, when we call a thing beautiful,
3033: it is to be regarded as a characteristic of the object which is
3034: determined in it according to concepts; though beauty, without a
3035: reference to the feeling of the subject, is nothing by itself. But we
3036: must reserve the examination of this question until we have answered
3037: another, viz. “If and how aesthetical judgements are possible _a
3038: priori_?”
3039: 
3040: We now occupy ourselves with the easier question, in what way we are
3041: conscious of a mutual subjective harmony of the cognitive powers
3042: with one another in the judgement of taste; is it aesthetically by
3043: mere internal sense and sensation? or is it intellectually by the
3044: consciousness of our designed activity, by which we bring them into
3045: play?
3046: 
3047: If the given representation, which occasions the judgement of taste,
3048: were a concept uniting Understanding and Imagination in the judging
3049: of the object, into a cognition of the Object, the consciousness of
3050: this relation would be intellectual (as in the objective schematism
3051: of the Judgement of which the Critique[20] treats). But then the
3052: judgement would not be laid down in reference to pleasure and pain, and
3053: consequently would not be a judgement of taste. But the judgement of
3054: taste, independently of concepts, determines the Object in respect of
3055: satisfaction and of the predicate of beauty. Therefore that subjective
3056: unity of relation can only make itself known by means of sensation.
3057: The excitement of both faculties (Imagination and Understanding) to
3058: indeterminate, but yet, through the stimulus of the given sensation,
3059: harmonious activity, viz. that which belongs to cognition in general,
3060: is the sensation whose universal communicability is postulated by the
3061: judgement of taste. An objective relation can only be thought, but
3062: yet, so far as it is subjective according to its conditions, can be
3063: felt in its effect on the mind; and, of a relation based on no concept
3064: (like the relation of the representative powers to a cognitive faculty
3065: in general), no other consciousness is possible than that through the
3066: sensation of the effect, which consists in the more lively play of both
3067: mental powers (the Imagination and the Understanding) when animated by
3068: mutual agreement. A representation which, as singular and apart from
3069: comparison with others, yet has an agreement with the conditions of
3070: universality which it is the business of the Understanding to supply,
3071: brings the cognitive faculties into that proportionate accord which
3072: we require for all cognition, and so regard as holding for every one
3073: who is determined to judge by means of Understanding and Sense in
3074: combination (_i.e._ for every man).

3077: EXPLANATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL RESULTING FROM THE SECOND MOMENT
3078: 
3079: The _beautiful_ is that which pleases universally, without a concept.

3084: THIRD MOMENT
3085: 
3086: OF JUDGEMENTS OF TASTE, ACCORDING TO THE RELATION OF THE PURPOSES WHICH
3087: ARE BROUGHT INTO CONSIDERATION THEREIN.
3088: 
3089: 
3090: § 10. _Of purposiveness in general_
3091: 
3092: If we wish to explain what a purpose is according to its transcendental
3093: determinations (without presupposing anything empirical like the
3094: feeling of pleasure) [we say that] the purpose is the object of a
3095: concept, in so far as the concept is regarded as the cause of the
3096: object (the real ground of its possibility); and the causality of a
3097: _concept_ in respect of its _Object_ is its purposiveness (_forma
3098: finalis_). Where then not merely the cognition of an object, but the
3099: object itself (its form and existence) is thought as an effect only
3100: possible by means of the concept of this latter, there we think a
3101: purpose. The representation of the effect is here the determining
3102: ground of its cause and precedes it. The consciousness of the causality
3103: of a representation, for _maintaining_ the subject in the same state,
3104: may here generally denote what we call pleasure; while on the other
3105: hand pain is that representation which contains the ground of the
3106: determination of the state of representations into their opposite [of
3107: restraining or removing them[21]].
3108: 
3109: The faculty of desire, so far as it is determinable only through
3110: concepts, _i.e._ to act in conformity with the representation of a
3111: purpose, would be the Will. But an Object, or a state of mind, or even
3112: an action, is called purposive, although its possibility does not
3113: necessarily presuppose the representation of a purpose, merely because
3114: its possibility can be explained and conceived by us only so far as we
3115: assume for its ground a causality according to purposes, _i.e._ a will
3116: which would have so disposed it according to the representation of a
3117: certain rule. There can be, then, purposiveness without[22] purpose,
3118: so far as we do not place the causes of this form in a will, but yet
3119: can only make the explanation of its possibility intelligible to
3120: ourselves by deriving it from a will. Again, we are not always forced
3121: to regard what we observe (in respect of its possibility) from the
3122: point of view of Reason. Thus we can at least observe a purposiveness
3123: according to form, without basing it on a purpose (as the material of
3124: the _nexus finalis_), and we can notice it in objects, although only
3125: by reflection.
3126: 
3127: 
3128: § 11. _The judgement of taste has nothing at its basis but the_ form of
3129: the purposiveness _of an object (or of its mode of representation)_
3130: 
3131: Every purpose, if it be regarded as a ground of satisfaction, always
3132: carries with it an interest--as the determining ground of the
3133: judgement--about the object of pleasure. Therefore no subjective
3134: purpose can lie at the basis of the judgement of taste. But neither
3135: can the judgement of taste be determined by any representation of an
3136: objective purpose, _i.e._ of the possibility of the object itself in
3137: accordance with principles of purposive combination, and consequently
3138: it can be determined by no concept of the good; because it is an
3139: aesthetical and not a cognitive judgement. It therefore has to do with
3140: no _concept_ of the character and internal or external possibility of
3141: the object by means of this or that cause, but merely with the relation
3142: of the representative powers to one another, so far as they are
3143: determined by a representation.
3144: 
3145: Now this relation in the determination of an object as beautiful
3146: is bound up with the feeling of pleasure, which is declared by the
3147: judgement of taste to be valid for every one; hence a pleasantness,
3148: accompanying the representation, can as little contain the determining
3149: ground [of the judgement] as the representation of the perfection of
3150: the object and the concept of the good can. Therefore it can be nothing
3151: else than the subjective purposiveness in the representation of an
3152: object without any purpose (either objective or subjective); and thus
3153: it is the mere form of purposiveness in the representation by which
3154: an object is _given_ to us, so far as we are conscious of it, which
3155: constitutes the satisfaction that we without a concept judge to be
3156: universally communicable; and, consequently, this is the determining
3157: ground of the judgement of taste.
3158: 
3159: 
3160: § 12. _The judgement of taste rests on_ a priori _grounds_
3161: 
3162: To establish _a priori_ the connexion of the feeling of a pleasure
3163: or pain as an effect, with any representation whatever (sensation or
3164: concept) as its cause, is absolutely impossible; for that would be a
3165: [particular][23] causal relation which (with objects of experience)
3166: can always only be cognised _a posteriori_, and through the medium
3167: of experience itself. We actually have, indeed, in the Critique of
3168: practical Reason, derived from universal moral concepts _a priori_ the
3169: feeling of respect (as a special and peculiar modification of feeling
3170: which will not strictly correspond either to the pleasure or the pain
3171: that we get from empirical objects). But there we could go beyond
3172: the bounds of experience and call in a causality which rested on a
3173: supersensible attribute of the subject, viz. freedom. And even there,
3174: properly speaking, it was not this _feeling_ which we derived from the
3175: Idea of the moral as cause, but merely the determination of the will.
3176: But the state of mind which accompanies any determination of the will
3177: is in itself a feeling of pleasure and identical with it, and therefore
3178: does not follow from it as its effect. This last must only be assumed
3179: if the concept of the moral as a good precede the determination of the
3180: will by the law; for in that case the pleasure that is bound up with
3181: the concept could not be derived from it as from a mere cognition.
3182: 
3183: Now the case is similar with the pleasure in aesthetical judgements,
3184: only that here it is merely contemplative and does not bring about
3185: an interest in the Object, which on the other hand in the moral
3186: judgement it is practical.[24] The consciousness of the mere formal
3187: purposiveness in the play of the subject’s cognitive powers, in a
3188: representation through which an object is given, is the pleasure
3189: itself; because it contains a determining ground of the activity of
3190: the subject in respect of the excitement of its cognitive powers,
3191: and therefore an inner causality (which is purposive) in respect of
3192: cognition in general without however being limited to any definite
3193: cognition; and consequently contains a mere form of the subjective
3194: purposiveness of a representation in an aesthetical judgement. This
3195: pleasure is in no way practical, neither like that arising from the
3196: pathological ground of pleasantness, nor that from the intellectual
3197: ground of the represented good. But yet it involves causality, viz. of
3198: _maintaining_ the state of the representation itself, and the exercise
3199: of the cognitive powers without further design. We _linger_ over the
3200: contemplation of the beautiful, because this contemplation strengthens
3201: and reproduces itself, which is analogous to (though not of the same
3202: kind as) that lingering which takes place when a [physical] charm in
3203: the representation of the object repeatedly arouses the attention, the
3204: mind being passive.
3205: 
3206: 
3207: § 13. _The pure judgement of taste is independent of charm and emotion_
3208: 
3209: Every interest spoils the judgement of taste and takes from its
3210: impartiality, especially if the purposiveness is not, as with the
3211: interest of Reason, placed before the feeling of pleasure but grounded
3212: on it. This last always happens in an aesthetical judgement upon
3213: anything so far as it gratifies or grieves us. Hence judgements so
3214: affected can lay no claim at all to a universally valid satisfaction,
3215: or at least so much the less claim, in proportion as there are
3216: sensations of this sort among the determining grounds of taste.
3217: That taste is still barbaric which needs a mixture of _charms_ and
3218: _emotions_ in order that there may be satisfaction, and still more so
3219: if it make these the measure of its assent.
3220: 
3221: Nevertheless charms are often not only taken account of in the case
3222: of beauty (which properly speaking ought merely to be concerned with
3223: form) as contributory to the aesthetical universal satisfaction; but
3224: they are passed off as in themselves beauties, and thus the matter of
3225: satisfaction is substituted for the form. This misconception, however,
3226: like so many others which have something true at their basis, may be
3227: removed by a careful definition of these concepts.
3228: 
3229: A judgement of taste on which charm and emotion have no influence
3230: (although they may be bound up with the satisfaction in the
3231: beautiful),--which therefore has as its determining ground merely the
3232: purposiveness of the form,--is a _pure judgement of taste_.
3233: 
3234: 
3235: § 14. _Elucidation by means of examples_
3236: 
3237: Aesthetical judgements can be divided just like theoretical (logical)
3238: judgements into empirical and pure. The first assert pleasantness or
3239: unpleasantness; the second assert the beauty of an object or of the
3240: manner of representing it. The former are judgements of Sense (material
3241: aesthetical judgements); the latter [as formal[25]] are alone strictly
3242: judgements of Taste.
3243: 
3244: A judgement of taste is therefore pure, only so far as no merely
3245: empirical satisfaction is mingled with its determining ground. But this
3246: always happens if charm or emotion have any share in the judgement by
3247: which anything is to be described as beautiful.
3248: 
3249: Now here many objections present themselves, which fallaciously put
3250: forward charm not merely as a necessary ingredient of beauty, but
3251: as alone sufficient [to justify] a thing’s being called beautiful.
3252: A mere colour, _e.g._ the green of a grass plot, a mere tone (as
3253: distinguished from sound and noise) like that of a violin, are by most
3254: people described as beautiful in themselves; although both seem to
3255: have at their basis merely the matter of representations, viz. simply
3256: sensation, and therefore only deserve to be called pleasant. But we
3257: must at the same time remark that the sensations of colours and of tone
3258: have a right to be regarded as beautiful only in so far as they are
3259: _pure_. This is a determination which concerns their form, and is the
3260: only [element] of these representations which admits with certainty of
3261: universal communicability; for we cannot assume that the quality of
3262: sensations is the same in all subjects, and we can hardly say that the
3263: pleasantness of one colour or the tone of one musical instrument is
3264: judged preferable to that of another in the same[26] way by every one.
3265: 
3266: If we assume with _Euler_ that colours are isochronous vibrations
3267: (_pulsus_) of the aether, as sounds are of the air in a state of
3268: disturbance, and,--what is most important,--that the mind not only
3269: perceives by sense the effect of these in exciting the organ, but also
3270: perceives by reflection the regular play of impressions (and thus the
3271: form of the combination of different representations) which I still
3272: do not doubt[27]--then colours and tone cannot be reckoned as mere
3273: sensations, but as the formal determination of the unity of a manifold
3274: of sensations, and thus as beauties in themselves.
3275: 
3276: But “pure” in a simple mode of sensation means that its uniformity is
3277: troubled and interrupted by no foreign sensation, and it belongs merely
3278: to the form; because here we can abstract from the quality of that
3279: mode of sensation (abstract from the colours and tone, if any, which
3280: it represents). Hence all simple colours, so far as they are pure,
3281: are regarded as beautiful; composite colours have not this advantage,
3282: because, as they are not simple, we have no standard for judging
3283: whether they should be called pure or not.
3284: 
3285: But as regards the beauty attributed to the object on account of its
3286: form, to suppose it to be capable of augmentation through the charm
3287: of the object is a common error, and one very prejudicial to genuine,
3288: uncorrupted, well-founded taste. We can doubtless add these charms to
3289: beauty, in order to interest the mind by the representation of the
3290: object, apart from the bare satisfaction [received]; and thus they may
3291: serve as a recommendation of taste and its cultivation, especially when
3292: it is yet crude and unexercised. But they actually do injury to the
3293: judgement of taste if they draw attention to themselves as the grounds
3294: for judging of beauty. So far are they from adding to beauty that they
3295: must only be admitted by indulgence as aliens; and provided always that
3296: they do not disturb the beautiful form, in cases when taste is yet weak
3297: and untrained.
3298: 
3299: In painting, sculpture, and in all the formative arts--in architecture,
3300: and horticulture, so far as they are beautiful arts--the _delineation_
3301: is the essential thing; and here it is not what gratifies in sensation
3302: but what pleases by means of its form that is fundamental for taste.
3303: The colours which light up the sketch belong to the charm; they may
3304: indeed enliven[28] the object for sensation, but they cannot make it
3305: worthy of contemplation and beautiful. In most cases they are rather
3306: limited by the requirements of the beautiful form; and even where charm
3307: is permissible it is ennobled solely by this.
3308: 
3309: Every form of the objects of sense (both of external sense and also
3310: mediately of internal) is either _figure_ or _play_. In the latter case
3311: it is either play of figures (in space, viz. pantomime and dancing), or
3312: the mere play of sensations (in time). The _charm_ of colours or of the
3313: pleasant tones of an instrument may be added; but the _delineation_
3314: in the first case and the composition in the second constitute the
3315: proper object of the pure judgement of taste. To say that the purity
3316: of colours and of tones, or their variety and contrast, seems to add
3317: to beauty, does not mean that they supply a homogeneous addition to
3318: our satisfaction in the form because they are pleasant in themselves;
3319: but they do so, because they make the form more exactly, definitely,
3320: and completely, intuitible, and besides by their charm [excite the
3321: representation, whilst they[29]] awaken and fix our attention on the
3322: object itself.
3323: 
3324: Even what we call _ornaments_ [parerga[29]], _i.e._ those things which
3325: do not belong to the complete representation of the object internally
3326: as elements but only externally as complements, and which augment the
3327: satisfaction of taste, do so only by their form; as for example [the
3328: frames of pictures,[29] or] the draperies of statues or the colonnades
3329: of palaces. But if the ornament does not itself consist in beautiful
3330: form, and if it is used as a golden frame is used, merely to recommend
3331: the painting by its _charm_, it is then called _finery_ and injures
3332: genuine beauty.
3333: 
3334: _Emotion_, _i.e._ a sensation in which pleasantness is produced by
3335: means of a momentary checking and a consequent more powerful outflow of
3336: the vital force, does not belong at all to beauty. But sublimity [with
3337: which the feeling of emotion is bound up[29]] requires a different
3338: standard of judgement from that which is at the foundation of taste;
3339: and thus a pure judgement of taste has for its determining ground
3340: neither charm nor emotion, in a word, no sensation as the material of
3341: the aesthetical judgement.
3342: 
3343: 
3344: § 15. _The judgement of taste is quite independent of the concept of
3345: perfection_
3346: 
3347: _Objective_ purposiveness can only be cognised by means of the
3348: reference of the manifold to a definite purpose, and therefore only
3349: through a concept. From this alone it is plain that the Beautiful, the
3350: judging of which has at its basis a merely formal purposiveness, _i.e._
3351: a purposiveness without purpose, is quite independent of the concept of
3352: the Good; because the latter presupposes an objective purposiveness,
3353: _i.e._ the reference of the object to a definite purpose.
3354: 
3355: Objective purposiveness is either external, _i.e._ the _utility_, or
3356: internal, _i.e._ the _perfection_ of the object. That the satisfaction
3357: in an object, on account of which we call it beautiful, cannot rest on
3358: the representation of its utility, is sufficiently obvious from the two
3359: preceding sections; because in that case it would not be an immediate
3360: satisfaction in the object, which is the essential condition of a
3361: judgement about beauty. But objective internal purposiveness, _i.e._
3362: perfection, comes nearer to the predicate of beauty; and it has been
3363: regarded by celebrated philosophers[30] as the same as beauty, with the
3364: proviso, _if it is thought in a confused way_. It is of the greatest
3365: importance in a Critique of Taste to decide whether beauty can thus
3366: actually be resolved into the concept of perfection.
3367: 
3368: To judge of objective purposiveness we always need not only the
3369: concept of a purpose, but (if that purposiveness is not to be external
3370: utility but internal) the concept of an internal purpose which shall
3371: contain the ground of the internal possibility of the object. Now
3372: as a purpose in general is that whose _concept_ can be regarded as
3373: the ground of the possibility of the object itself; so, in order to
3374: represent objective purposiveness in a thing, the concept of _what sort
3375: of thing it is to be_ must come first. The agreement of the manifold
3376: in it with this concept (which furnishes the rule for combining the
3377: manifold) is the _qualitative perfection_ of the thing. Quite different
3378: from this is _quantitative_ perfection, the completeness of a thing
3379: after its kind, which is a mere concept of magnitude (of totality).[31]
3380: In this _what the thing ought to be_ is conceived as already
3381: determined, and it is only asked if it has _all_ its requisites. The
3382: formal [element] in the representation of a thing, _i.e._ the agreement
3383: of the manifold with a unity (it being undetermined what this ought
3384: to be), gives to cognition no objective purposiveness whatever. For
3385: since abstraction is made of this unity as _purpose_ (what the thing
3386: ought to be), nothing remains but the subjective purposiveness of
3387: the representations in the mind of the intuiting subject. And this,
3388: although it furnishes a certain purposiveness of the representative
3389: state of the subject, and so a facility of apprehending a given form
3390: by the Imagination, yet furnishes no perfection of an Object, since
3391: the Object is not here conceived by means of the concept of a purpose.
3392: For example, if in a forest I come across a plot of sward, round which
3393: trees stand in a circle, and do not then represent to myself a purpose,
3394: viz. that it is intended to serve for country dances, not the least
3395: concept of perfection is furnished by the mere form. But to represent
3396: to oneself a formal _objective_ purposiveness without purpose, _i.e._
3397: the mere form of a _perfection_ (without any matter and without
3398: the _concept_ of that with which it is accordant, even if it were
3399: merely the Idea of conformity to law in general[32]) is a veritable
3400: contradiction.
3401: 
3402: Now the judgement of taste is an aesthetical judgement, _i.e._ such
3403: as rests on subjective grounds, the determining ground of which
3404: cannot be a concept, and consequently cannot be the concept of a
3405: definite purpose. Therefore in beauty, regarded as a formal subjective
3406: purposiveness, there is in no way thought a perfection of the object,
3407: as a would-be formal purposiveness, which yet is objective. And thus to
3408: distinguish between the concepts of the Beautiful and the Good, as if
3409: they were only different in logical form, the first being a confused,
3410: the second a clear concept of perfection, but identical in content and
3411: origin, is quite fallacious. For then there would be no _specific_
3412: difference between them, but a judgement of taste would be as much a
3413: cognitive judgement as the judgement by which a thing is described as
3414: good; just as when the ordinary man says that fraud is unjust he bases
3415: his judgement on confused grounds, whilst the philosopher bases it
3416: on clear grounds, but both on identical principles of Reason. I have
3417: already, however, said that an aesthetical judgement is unique of its
3418: kind, and gives absolutely no cognition (not even a confused cognition)
3419: of the Object; this is only supplied by a logical judgement. On the
3420: contrary, it simply refers the representation, by which an Object is
3421: given, to the subject; and brings to our notice no characteristic
3422: of the object, but only the purposive form in the determination of
3423: the representative powers which are occupying themselves therewith.
3424: The judgement is called aesthetical just because its determining
3425: ground is not a concept, but the feeling (of internal sense) of that
3426: harmony in the play of the mental powers, so far as it can be felt in
3427: sensation. On the other hand, if we wish to call confused concepts and
3428: the objective judgement based on them, aesthetical, we shall have an
3429: Understanding judging sensibly or a Sense representing its Objects by
3430: means of concepts [both of which are contradictory.[33]] The faculty
3431: of concepts, be they confused or clear, is the Understanding; and
3432: although Understanding has to do with the judgement of taste, as an
3433: aesthetical judgement (as it has with all judgements), yet it has to
3434: do with it not as a faculty by which an object is cognised, but as the
3435: faculty which determines the judgement and its representation (without
3436: any concept) in accordance with its relation to the subject and the
3437: subject’s internal feeling, in so far as this judgement may be possible
3438: in accordance with a universal rule.
3439: 
3440: 
3441: § 16. _The judgement of taste, by which an object is declared to be
3442: beautiful under the condition of a definite concept, is not pure_

3444: There are two kinds of beauty; free beauty (_pulchritudo vaga_)
3445: or merely dependent beauty (_pulchritudo adhaerens_). The first
3446: presupposes no concept of what the object ought to be; the second
3447: does presuppose such a concept and the perfection of the object in
3448: accordance therewith. The first is called the (self-subsistent)
3449: beauty of this or that thing; the second, as dependent upon a concept
3450: (conditioned beauty), is ascribed to Objects which come under the
3451: concept of a particular purpose.
3452: 
3453: Flowers are free natural beauties. Hardly any one but a botanist
3454: knows what sort of a thing a flower ought to be; and even he, though
3455: recognising in the flower the reproductive organ of the plant, pays no
3456: regard to this natural purpose if he is passing judgement on the flower
3457: by Taste. There is then at the basis of this judgement no perfection
3458: of any kind, no internal purposiveness, to which the collection of the
3459: manifold is referred. Many birds (such as the parrot, the humming bird,
3460: the bird of paradise), and many sea shells are beauties in themselves,
3461: which do not belong to any object determined in respect of its purpose
3462: by concepts, but please freely and in themselves. So also delineations
3463: _à la grecque_, foliage for borders or wall-papers, mean nothing
3464: in themselves; they represent nothing--no Object under a definite
3465: concept,--and are free beauties. We can refer to the same class what
3466: are called in music phantasies (_i.e._ pieces without any theme), and
3467: in fact all music without words.
3468: 
3469: In the judging of a free beauty (according to the mere form) the
3470: judgement of taste is pure. There is presupposed no concept of any
3471: purpose, for which the manifold should serve the given Object, and
3472: which therefore is to be represented therein. By such a concept the
3473: freedom of the Imagination which disports itself in the contemplation
3474: of the figure would be only limited.
3475: 
3476: But human beauty (_i.e._ of a man, a woman, or a child), the beauty of
3477: a horse, or a building (be it church, palace, arsenal, or summer-house)
3478: presupposes a concept of the purpose which determines what the thing is
3479: to be, and consequently a concept of its perfection; it is therefore
3480: adherent beauty. Now as the combination of the Pleasant (in sensation)
3481: with Beauty, which properly is only concerned with form, is a hindrance
3482: to the purity of the judgement of taste; so also is its purity injured
3483: by the combination with Beauty of the Good (viz. that manifold which is
3484: good for the thing itself in accordance with its purpose).
3485: 
3486: We could add much to a building which would immediately please the eye,
3487: if only it were not to be a church. We could adorn a figure with all
3488: kinds of spirals and light but regular lines, as the New Zealanders do
3489: with their tattooing, if only it were not the figure of a human being.
3490: And again this could have much finer features and a more pleasing and
3491: gentle cast of countenance provided it were not intended to represent a
3492: man, much less a warrior.
3493: 
3494: Now the satisfaction in the manifold of a thing in reference to the
3495: internal purpose which determines its possibility is a satisfaction
3496: grounded on a concept; but the satisfaction in beauty is such as
3497: presupposes no concept, but is immediately bound up with the
3498: representation through which the object is given (not through which it
3499: is thought). If now the judgement of Taste in respect of the beauty
3500: of a thing is made dependent on the purpose in its manifold, like a
3501: judgement of Reason, and thus limited, it is no longer a free and pure
3502: judgement of Taste.
3503: 
3504: It is true that taste gains by this combination of aesthetical with
3505: intellectual satisfaction, inasmuch as it becomes fixed; and though
3506: it is not universal, yet in respect to certain purposively determined
3507: Objects it becomes possible to prescribe rules for it. These, however,
3508: are not rules of taste, but merely rules for the unification of Taste
3509: with Reason, _i.e._ of the Beautiful with the Good, by which the former
3510: becomes available as an instrument of design in respect of the latter.
3511: Thus the tone of mind which is self-maintaining and of subjective
3512: universal validity is subordinated to the way of thinking which can
3513: be maintained only by painful resolve, but is of objective universal
3514: validity. Properly speaking, however, perfection gains nothing by
3515: beauty or beauty by perfection; but, when we compare the representation
3516: by which an object is given to us with the Object (as regards what it
3517: ought to be) by means of a concept, we cannot avoid considering along
3518: with it the sensation in the subject. And thus when both states of mind
3519: are in harmony our _whole faculty_ of representative power gains.
3520: 
3521: A judgement of taste, then, in respect of an object with a definite
3522: internal purpose, can only be pure, if either the person judging
3523: has no concept of this purpose, or else abstracts from it in his
3524: judgement. Such a person, although forming an accurate judgement of
3525: taste in judging of the object as free beauty, would yet by another
3526: who considers the beauty in it only as a dependent attribute (who looks
3527: to the purpose of the object) be blamed, and accused of false taste;
3528: although both are right in their own way, the one in reference to what
3529: he has before his eyes, the other in reference to what he has in his
3530: thought. By means of this distinction we can settle many disputes about
3531: beauty between judges of taste; by showing that the one is speaking of
3532: free, the other of dependent, beauty,--that the first is making a pure,
3533: the second an applied, judgement of taste.
3534: 
3535: 
3536: § 17. _Of the Ideal of beauty_
3537: 
3538: There can be no objective rule of taste which shall determine by
3539: means of concepts what is beautiful. For every judgement from this
3540: source is aesthetical; _i.e._ the feeling of the subject, and not
3541: a concept of the Object, is its determining ground. To seek for a
3542: principle of taste which shall furnish, by means of definite concepts,
3543: a universal criterion of the beautiful, is fruitless trouble; because
3544: what is sought is impossible and self-contradictory. The universal
3545: communicability of sensation (satisfaction or dissatisfaction) without
3546: the aid of a concept--the agreement, as far as is possible, of all
3547: times and peoples as regards this feeling in the representation of
3548: certain objects--this is the empirical criterion, although weak and
3549: hardly sufficing for probability, of the derivation of a taste, thus
3550: confirmed by examples, from the deep-lying grounds of agreement common
3551: to all men, in judging of the forms under which objects are given to
3552: them.
3553: 
3554: Hence, we consider some products of taste as _exemplary_. Not that
3555: taste can be acquired by imitating others; for it must be an original
3556: faculty. He who imitates a model shows, no doubt, in so far as he
3557: attains to it, skill; but only shows taste in so far as he can judge
3558: of this model itself.[34] It follows from hence that the highest
3559: model, the archetype of taste, is a mere Idea, which every one must
3560: produce in himself; and according to which he must judge every Object
3561: of taste, every example of judgement by taste, and even the taste
3562: of every one. _Idea_ properly means a rational concept, and _Ideal_
3563: the representation of an individual being, regarded as adequate to
3564: an Idea.[35] Hence that archetype of taste, which certainly rests on
3565: the indeterminate Idea that Reason has of a maximum, but which cannot
3566: be represented by concepts, but only in an individual presentation,
3567: is better called the Ideal of the beautiful. Although we are not in
3568: possession of this, we yet strive to produce it in ourselves. But
3569: it can only be an Ideal of the Imagination, because it rests on a
3570: presentation and not on concepts, and the Imagination is the faculty of
3571: presentation.--How do we arrive at such an Ideal of beauty? _A priori_,
3572: or empirically? Moreover, what species of the beautiful is susceptible
3573: of an Ideal?
3574: 
3575: First, it is well to remark that the beauty for which an Ideal is to
3576: be sought cannot be _vague_ beauty, but is _fixed_ by a concept of
3577: objective purposiveness; and thus it cannot appertain to the Object
3578: of a quite pure judgement of taste, but to that of a judgement of
3579: taste which is in part intellectual. That is, in whatever grounds of
3580: judgement an Ideal is to be found, an Idea of Reason in accordance with
3581: definite concepts must lie at its basis; which determines _a priori_
3582: the purpose on which the internal possibility of the object rests.
3583: An Ideal of beautiful flowers, of a beautiful piece of furniture,
3584: of a beautiful view, is inconceivable. But neither can an Ideal be
3585: represented of a beauty dependent on definite purposes, _e.g._ of a
3586: beautiful dwelling-house, a beautiful tree, a beautiful garden, etc.;
3587: presumably because their purpose is not sufficiently determined and
3588: fixed by the concept, and thus the purposiveness is nearly as free as
3589: in the case of _vague_ beauty. The only being which has the purpose of
3590: its existence in itself is _man_, who can determine his purposes by
3591: Reason; or, where he must receive them from external perception, yet
3592: can compare them with essential and universal purposes, and can judge
3593: this their accordance aesthetically. This _man_ is, then, alone of all
3594: objects in the world, susceptible of an Ideal of _beauty_; as it is
3595: only _humanity_ in his person, as an intelligence, that is susceptible
3596: of the Ideal of _perfection_.
3597: 
3598: But there are here two elements. _First_, there is the aesthetical
3599: _normal Idea_, which is an individual intuition (of the Imagination),
3600: representing the standard of our judgement [upon man] as a thing
3601: belonging to a particular animal species. _Secondly_, there is the
3602: _rational Idea_ which makes the purposes of humanity, so far as they
3603: cannot be sensibly represented, the principle for judging of a figure
3604: through which, as their phenomenal effect, those purposes are revealed.
3605: The normal Idea of the figure of an animal of a particular race must
3606: take its elements from experience. But the greatest purposiveness
3607: in the construction of the figure, that would be available for the
3608: universal standard of aesthetical judgement upon each individual of
3609: this species--the image which is as it were designedly at the basis of
3610: nature’s Technic, to which only the whole race and not any isolated
3611: individual is adequate--this lies merely in the Idea of the judging
3612: [subject]. And this, with its proportions, as an aesthetical Idea, can
3613: be completely presented _in concreto_ in a model. In order to make
3614: intelligible in some measure (for who can extract her whole secret
3615: from nature?) how this comes to pass, we shall attempt a psychological
3616: explanation.
3617: 
3618: We must remark that, in a way quite incomprehensible by us, the
3619: Imagination can not only recall, on occasion, the signs for concepts
3620: long past, but can also reproduce the image of the figure of the object
3621: out of an unspeakable number of objects of different kinds or even of
3622: the same kind. Further, if the mind is concerned with comparisons, the
3623: Imagination can, in all probability, actually though unconsciously let
3624: one image glide into another, and thus by the concurrence of several of
3625: the same kind come by an average, which serves as the common measure
3626: of all. Every one has seen a thousand full-grown men. Now if you wish
3627: to judge of their normal size, estimating it by means of comparison,
3628: the Imagination (as I think) allows a great number of images (perhaps
3629: the whole thousand) to fall on one another. If I am allowed to apply
3630: here the analogy of optical presentation, it is in the space where
3631: most of them are combined and inside the contour, where the place is
3632: illuminated with the most vivid colours, that the _average size_ is
3633: cognisable; which, both in height and breadth, is equally far removed
3634: from the extreme bounds of the greatest and smallest stature. And this
3635: is the stature of a beautiful man. (We could arrive at the same thing
3636: mechanically, by adding together all thousand magnitudes, heights,
3637: breadths, and thicknesses, and dividing the sum by a thousand. But the
3638: Imagination does this by means of a dynamical effect, which arises
3639: from the various impressions of such figures on the organ of internal
3640: sense.) If now in a similar way for this average man we seek the
3641: average head, for this head the average nose, etc., such figure is at
3642: the basis of the normal Idea in the country where the comparison is
3643: instituted. Thus necessarily under these empirical conditions a negro
3644: must have a different normal Idea of the beauty of the [human figure]
3645: from a white man, a Chinaman a different normal Idea from a European,
3646: etc. And the same is the case with the model of a beautiful horse or
3647: dog (of a certain breed).--This _normal Idea_ is not derived from
3648: proportions got from experience [and regarded] _as definite rules_; but
3649: in accordance with it rules for judging become in the first instance
3650: possible. It is the image for the whole race, which floats among all
3651: the variously different intuitions of individuals, which nature takes
3652: as archetype in her productions of the same species, but which seems
3653: not to be fully reached in any individual case. It is by no means the
3654: whole _archetype of beauty_ in the race, but only the form constituting
3655: the indispensable condition of all beauty, and thus merely
3656: _correctness_ in the [mental] presentation of the race. It is, like the
3657: celebrated _Doryphorus_ of _Polycletus_,[36] the _rule_ (_Myron’s_[37]
3658: Cow might also be used thus for its kind). It can therefore contain
3659: nothing specifically characteristic, for otherwise it would not be
3660: the _normal Idea_ for the race. Its presentation pleases, not by its
3661: beauty, but merely because it contradicts no condition, under which
3662: alone a thing of this kind can be beautiful. The presentation is merely
3663: correct.[38]
3664: 
3665: We must yet distinguish the _normal Idea_ of the beautiful from the
3666: _Ideal_, which latter, on grounds already alleged, we can only expect
3667: in the _human_ figure. In this the Ideal consists in the expression
3668: of the _moral_, without which the object would not please universally
3669: and thus positively (not merely negatively in a correct presentation).
3670: The visible expression of moral Ideas that rule men inwardly, can
3671: indeed only be got from experience; but to make its connexion with
3672: all which our Reason unites with the morally good in the Idea of the
3673: highest purposiveness,--goodness of heart, purity, strength, peace,
3674: etc.,--visible as it were in bodily manifestation (as the effect of
3675: that which is internal), requires a union of pure Ideas of Reason with
3676: great imaginative power, even in him who wishes to judge of it, still
3677: more in him who wishes to present it. The correctness of such an Ideal
3678: of beauty is shown by its permitting no sensible charm to mingle with
3679: the satisfaction in the Object and yet allowing us to take a great
3680: interest therein. This shows that a judgement in accordance with such
3681: a standard can never be purely aesthetical, and that a judgement in
3682: accordance with an Ideal of beauty is not a mere judgement of taste.
3683: 
3684: 
3685: EXPLANATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL DERIVED FROM THIS THIRD MOMENT
3686: 
3687: _Beauty_ is the form of the _purposiveness_ of an object, so far as
3688: this is perceived in it _without any representation of a purpose_.[39]
3689: 
3690: 
3691: 
3692: 
3693: FOURTH MOMENT
3694: 
3695: OF THE JUDGEMENT OF TASTE, ACCORDING TO THE MODALITY OF THE
3696: SATISFACTION IN THE OBJECT
3697: 
3698: 
3699: § 18. _What the modality in a judgement of taste is_
3700: 
3701: I can say of every representation that it is at least _possible_
3702: that (as a cognition) it should be bound up with a pleasure. Of a
3703: representation that I call _pleasant_ I say that it _actually_ excites
3704: pleasure in me. But the _beautiful_ we think as having a _necessary_
3705: reference to satisfaction. Now this necessity is of a peculiar kind.
3706: It is not a theoretical objective necessity; in which case it would be
3707: cognised _a priori_ that every one _will feel_ this satisfaction in
3708: the object called beautiful by me. It is not a practical necessity;
3709: in which case, by concepts of a pure rational will serving as a rule
3710: for freely acting beings, the satisfaction is the necessary result of
3711: an objective law and only indicates that we absolutely (without any
3712: further design) ought to act in a certain way. But the necessity which
3713: is thought in an aesthetical judgement can only be called _exemplary_;
3714: _i.e._ a necessity of the assent of _all_ to a judgement which is
3715: regarded as the example of a universal rule that we cannot state. Since
3716: an aesthetical judgement is not an objective cognitive judgement, this
3717: necessity cannot be derived from definite concepts, and is therefore
3718: not apodictic. Still less can it be inferred from the universality of
3719: experience (of a complete agreement of judgements as to the beauty
3720: of a certain object). For not only would experience hardly furnish
3721: sufficiently numerous vouchers for this; but also, on empirical
3722: judgements we can base no concept of the necessity of these judgements.
3723: 
3724: 
3725: § 19. _The subjective necessity, which we ascribe to the judgement of
3726: taste, is conditioned_
3727: 
3728: The judgement of taste requires the agreement of every one; and he
3729: who describes anything as beautiful claims that every one _ought_
3730: to give his approval to the object in question and also describe it
3731: as beautiful. The _ought_ in the aesthetical judgement is therefore
3732: pronounced in accordance with all the data which are required for
3733: judging and yet is only conditioned. We ask for the agreement of every
3734: one else, because we have for it a ground that is common to all; and we
3735: could count on this agreement, provided we were always sure that the
3736: case was correctly subsumed under that ground as rule of assent.
3737: 
3738: 
3739: § 20. _The condition of necessity which a judgement of taste asserts is
3740: the Idea of a common sense_
3741: 
3742: If judgements of taste (like cognitive judgements) had a definite
3743: objective principle, then the person who lays them down in accordance
3744: with this latter would claim an unconditioned necessity for his
3745: judgement. If they were devoid of all principle, like those of the
3746: mere taste of sense, we would not allow them in thought any necessity
3747: whatever. Hence they must have a subjective principle which determines
3748: what pleases or displeases only by feeling and not by concepts, but
3749: yet with universal validity. But such a principle could only be
3750: regarded as a _common sense_, which is essentially different from
3751: common Understanding which people sometimes call common Sense (_sensus
3752: communis_); for the latter does not judge by feeling but always
3753: by concepts, although ordinarily only as by obscurely represented
3754: principles.
3755: 
3756: Hence it is only under the presupposition that there is a common sense
3757: (by which we do not understand an external sense, but the effect
3758: resulting from the free play of our cognitive powers)--it is only under
3759: this presupposition, I say, that the judgement of taste can be laid
3760: down.
3761: 
3762: 
3763: § 21. _Have we ground for presupposing a common sense?_
3764: 
3765: Cognitions and judgements must, along with the conviction that
3766: accompanies them, admit of universal communicability; for otherwise
3767: there would be no harmony between them and the Object, and they would
3768: be collectively a mere subjective play of the representative powers,
3769: exactly as scepticism would have it. But if cognitions are to admit of
3770: communicability, so must also the state of mind,--_i.e._ the accordance
3771: of the cognitive powers with a cognition generally, and that proportion
3772: of them which is suitable for a representation (by which an object is
3773: given to us) in order that a cognition may be made out of it--admit of
3774: universal communicability. For without this as the subjective condition
3775: of cognition, knowledge as an effect could not arise. This actually
3776: always takes place when a given object by means of Sense excites the
3777: Imagination to collect the manifold, and the Imagination in its turn
3778: excites the Understanding to bring about a unity of this collective
3779: process in concepts. But this accordance of the cognitive powers has
3780: a different proportion according to the variety of the Objects which
3781: are given. However, it must be such that this internal relation, by
3782: which one mental faculty is excited by another, shall be generally the
3783: most beneficial for both faculties in respect of cognition (of given
3784: objects); and this accordance can only be determined by feeling (not
3785: according to concepts). Since now this accordance itself must admit
3786: of universal communicability, and consequently also our feeling of it
3787: (in a given representation), and since the universal communicability
3788: of a feeling presupposes a common sense, we have grounds for assuming
3789: this latter. And this common sense is assumed without relying on
3790: psychological observations, but simply as the necessary condition of
3791: the universal communicability of our knowledge, which is presupposed in
3792: every Logic and in every principle of knowledge that is not sceptical.
3793: 
3794: 
3795: § 22. _The necessity of the universal agreement that is thought in a
3796: judgement of taste is a subjective necessity, which is represented as
3797: objective under the presupposition of a common sense_
3798: 
3799: In all judgements by which we describe anything as beautiful, we
3800: allow no one to be of another opinion; without however grounding our
3801: judgement on concepts but only on our feeling, which we therefore
3802: place at its basis not as a private, but as a communal feeling.[40]
3803: Now this common sense cannot be grounded on experience; for it aims at
3804: justifying judgements which contain an _ought_. It does not say that
3805: every one _will_ agree with my judgement, but that he _ought_. And so
3806: common sense, as an example of whose judgement I here put forward my
3807: judgement of taste and on account of which I attribute to the latter an
3808: _exemplary_ validity, is a mere ideal norm, under the supposition of
3809: which I have a right to make into a rule for every one a judgement that
3810: accords therewith, as well as the satisfaction in an Object expressed
3811: in such judgement. For the principle, which concerns the agreement of
3812: different judging persons, although only subjective, is yet assumed as
3813: subjectively universal (an Idea necessary for every one); and thus can
3814: claim universal assent (as if it were objective) provided we are sure
3815: that we have correctly subsumed [the particulars] under it.
3816: 
3817: This indeterminate norm of a common sense is actually presupposed by
3818: us; as is shown by our claim to lay down judgements of taste. Whether
3819: there is in fact such a common sense, as a constitutive principle of
3820: the possibility of experience, or whether a yet higher principle of
3821: Reason makes it only into a regulative principle for producing in us
3822: a common sense for higher purposes: whether therefore Taste is an
3823: original and natural faculty, or only the Idea of an artificial one yet
3824: to be acquired, so that a judgement of taste with its assumption of a
3825: universal assent in fact, is only a requirement of Reason for producing
3826: such harmony of sentiment; whether the “ought,” _i.e._ the objective
3827: necessity of the confluence of the feeling of any one man with that of
3828: every other, only signifies the possibility of arriving at this accord,
3829: and the judgement of taste only affords an example of the application
3830: of this principle: these questions we have neither the wish nor the
3831: power to investigate as yet; we have now only to resolve the faculty of
3832: taste into its elements in order to unite them at last in the Idea of
3833: a common sense.
3834: 
3835: 
3836: EXPLANATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL RESULTING FROM THE FOURTH MOMENT
3837: 
3838: The _beautiful_ is that which without any concept is cognised as the
3839: object of a _necessary_ satisfaction.
3840: 
3841: 
3842: GENERAL REMARK ON THE FIRST SECTION OF THE ANALYTIC
3843: 
3844: If we seek the result of the preceding analysis we find that everything
3845: runs up into this concept of Taste, that it is a faculty for judging
3846: an object in reference to the Imagination’s _free conformity to law_.
3847: Now if in the judgement of taste the Imagination must be considered in
3848: its freedom, it is in the first place not regarded as reproductive,
3849: as it is subject to the laws of association, but as productive and
3850: spontaneous (as the author of arbitrary forms of possible intuition).
3851: And although in the apprehension of a given object of sense it is
3852: tied to a definite form of this Object, and so far has no free play
3853: (such as that of poetry) yet it may readily be conceived that the
3854: object can furnish it with such a form containing a collection of
3855: the manifold, as the Imagination itself, if it were left free, would
3856: project in accordance with the _conformity to law of the Understanding_
3857: in general. But that the _imaginative power_ should be _free_ and yet
3858: _of itself conformed to law_, _i.e._ bringing autonomy with it, is a
3859: contradiction. The Understanding alone gives the law. If, however,
3860: the Imagination is compelled to proceed according to a definite law,
3861: its product in respect of form is determined by concepts as to what
3862: it ought to be. But then, as is above shown, the satisfaction is not
3863: that in the Beautiful, but in the Good (in perfection, at any rate
3864: in mere formal perfection); and the judgement is not a judgement of
3865: taste. Hence it is a conformity to law without a law; and a subjective
3866: agreement of the Imagination and Understanding,--without such an
3867: objective agreement as there is when the representation is referred
3868: to a definite concept of an object,--can subsist along with the
3869: free conformity to law of the Understanding (which is also called
3870: purposiveness without purpose) and with the peculiar feature of a
3871: judgement of taste.
3872: 
3873: Now geometrically regular figures, such as a circle, a square, a
3874: cube, etc., are commonly adduced by critics of taste as the simplest
3875: and most indisputable examples of beauty; and yet they are called
3876: regular, because we can only represent them by regarding them as mere
3877: presentations of a definite concept which prescribes the rule for the
3878: figure (according to which alone it is possible). One of these two must
3879: be wrong, either that judgement of the critic which ascribes beauty to
3880: the said figures, or ours, which regards purposiveness apart from a
3881: concept as requisite for beauty.
3882: 
3883: Hardly any one will say that a man must have taste in order that he
3884: should find more satisfaction in a circle than in a scrawled outline,
3885: in an equilateral and equiangular quadrilateral than in one which is
3886: oblique, irregular, and as it were deformed, for this belongs to the
3887: ordinary Understanding and is not Taste at all. Where, _e.g._ our
3888: design is to judge of the size of an area, or to make intelligible
3889: the relation of the parts of it, when divided, to one another and
3890: to the whole, then regular figures and those of the simplest kind
3891: are needed, and the satisfaction does not rest immediately on
3892: the aspect of the figure, but on its availability for all kinds
3893: of possible designs. A room whose walls form oblique angles, or a
3894: parterre of this kind, even every violation of symmetry in the figure
3895: of animals (_e.g._ being one-eyed), of buildings, or of flower beds,
3896: displeases, because it contradicts the purpose of the thing, not only
3897: practically in respect of a definite use of it, but also when we pass
3898: judgement on it as regards any possible design. This is not the case
3899: in the judgement of taste, which when pure combines satisfaction
3900: or dissatisfaction,--without any reference to its use or to a
3901: purpose,--with the mere _consideration_ of the object.
3902: 
3903: The regularity which leads to the concept of an object is indeed the
3904: indispensable condition (_conditio sine qua non_) for grasping the
3905: object in a single representation and determining the manifold in its
3906: form. This determination is a purpose in respect of cognition, and
3907: in reference to this it is always bound up with satisfaction (which
3908: accompanies the execution of every, even problematical, design). There
3909: is here, however, merely the approval of the solution satisfying a
3910: problem, and not a free and indefinite purposive entertainment of the
3911: mental powers with what we call beautiful, where the Understanding is
3912: at the service of Imagination and not _vice versa_.
3913: 
3914: In a thing that is only possible by means of design,--a building, or
3915: even an animal,--the regularity consisting in symmetry must express
3916: the unity of the intuition that accompanies the concept of purpose,
3917: and this regularity belongs to cognition. But where only a free play
3918: of the representative powers (under the condition, however, that the
3919: Understanding is to suffer no shock thereby) is to be kept up, in
3920: pleasure gardens, room decorations, all kinds of tasteful furniture,
3921: etc., regularity that shows constraint is avoided as much as possible.
3922: Thus in the English taste in gardens, or in bizarre taste in furniture,
3923: the freedom of the Imagination is pushed almost near to the grotesque,
3924: and in this separation from every constraint of rule we have the case,
3925: where taste can display its greatest perfection in the enterprises of
3926: the Imagination.
3927: 
3928: All stiff regularity (such as approximates to mathematical regularity)
3929: has something in it repugnant to taste; for our entertainment in
3930: the contemplation of it lasts for no length of time, but it rather,
3931: in so far as it has not expressly in view cognition or a definite
3932: practical purpose, produces weariness. On the other hand that with
3933: which Imagination can play in an unstudied and purposive manner
3934: is always new to us, and one does not get tired of looking at it.
3935: _Marsden_ in his description of Sumatra makes the remark that the
3936: free beauties of nature surround the spectator everywhere and thus
3937: lose their attraction for him.[41] On the other hand a pepper-garden,
3938: where the stakes on which this plant twines itself form parallel rows,
3939: had much attractiveness for him, if he met with it in the middle of a
3940: forest. And hence he infers that wild beauty, apparently irregular,
3941: only pleases as a variation from the regular beauty of which one has
3942: seen enough. But he need only have made the experiment of spending
3943: one day in a pepper-garden, to have been convinced that, once the
3944: Understanding, by the aid of this regularity, has put itself in accord
3945: with the order that it always needs, the object will not entertain for
3946: long,--nay rather it will impose a burdensome constraint upon the
3947: Imagination. On the other hand, nature, which there is prodigal in
3948: its variety even to luxuriance, that is subjected to no constraint of
3949: artificial rules, can supply constant food for taste.--Even the song
3950: of birds, which we can bring under no musical rule, seems to have more
3951: freedom, and therefore more for taste, than a song of a human being
3952: which is produced in accordance with all the rules of music; for we
3953: very much sooner weary of the latter, if it is repeated often and at
3954: length. Here, however, we probably confuse our participation in the
3955: mirth of a little creature that we love, with the beauty of its song;
3956: for if this were exactly imitated by man (as sometimes the notes of the
3957: nightingale are)[42] it would seem to our ear quite devoid of taste.
3958: 
3959: Again, beautiful objects are to be distinguished from beautiful
3960: views of objects (which often on account of their distance cannot be
3961: clearly recognised). In the latter case taste appears not so much in
3962: what the Imagination _apprehends_ in this field, as in the impulse it
3963: thus gets to _fiction_, _i.e._ in the peculiar fancies with which the
3964: mind entertains itself, whilst it is continually being aroused by the
3965: variety which strikes the eye. An illustration is afforded, _e.g._
3966: by the sight of the changing shapes of a fire on the hearth or of a
3967: rippling brook; neither of these has beauty, but they bring with them a
3968: charm for the Imagination, because they entertain it in free play.

3973: SECOND BOOK
3974: 
3975: ANALYTIC OF THE SUBLIME
3976: 
3977: 
3978: § 23. _Transition from the faculty which judges of the Beautiful to
3979: that which judges of the Sublime_
3980: 
3981: The Beautiful and the Sublime agree in this, that both please in
3982: themselves. Further, neither presupposes a judgement of sense nor
3983: a judgement logically determined, but a judgement of reflection.
3984: Consequently the satisfaction [belonging to them] does not depend
3985: on a sensation, as in the case of the Pleasant, nor on a definite
3986: concept, as in the case of the Good; but it is nevertheless referred
3987: to concepts although indeterminate ones. And so the satisfaction is
3988: connected with the mere presentation [of the object] or with the
3989: faculty of presentation; so that in the case of a given intuition this
3990: faculty or the Imagination is considered as in agreement with the
3991: _faculty of concepts_ of Understanding or Reason (in its furtherance of
3992: these latter). Hence both kinds of judgements are _singular_, and yet
3993: announce themselves as universally valid for every subject; although
3994: they lay claim merely to the feeling of pleasure and not to any
3995: knowledge of the object.
3996: 
3997: But there are also remarkable differences between the two. The
3998: Beautiful in nature is connected with the form of the object, which
3999: consists in having boundaries. The Sublime, on the other hand, is to
4000: be found in a formless object, so far as in it or by occasion of it
4001: _boundlessness_ is represented, and yet its totality is also present to
4002: thought. Thus the Beautiful seems to be regarded as the presentation
4003: of an indefinite concept of Understanding; the Sublime as that of a
4004: like concept of Reason. Therefore the satisfaction in the one case is
4005: bound up with the representation of _quality_, in the other with that
4006: of _quantity_. And the latter satisfaction is quite different in kind
4007: from the former, for this [the Beautiful[43]] directly brings with
4008: it a feeling of the furtherance of life, and thus is compatible with
4009: charms and with the play of the Imagination. But the other [the feeling
4010: of the Sublime[43]] is a pleasure that arises only indirectly; viz.
4011: it is produced by the feeling of a momentary checking of the vital
4012: powers and a consequent stronger outflow of them, so that it seems to
4013: be regarded as emotion,--not play, but earnest in the exercise of the
4014: Imagination.--Hence it is incompatible with charms; and as the mind
4015: is not merely attracted by the object but is ever being alternately
4016: repelled, the satisfaction in the sublime does not so much involve a
4017: positive pleasure as admiration or respect, which rather deserves to be
4018: called negative pleasure.
4019: 
4020: But the inner and most important distinction between the Sublime
4021: and Beautiful is, certainly, as follows. (Here, as we are entitled
4022: to do, we only bring under consideration in the first instance the
4023: sublime in natural Objects; for the sublime of Art is always limited
4024: by the conditions of agreement with Nature.) Natural beauty (which is
4025: self-subsisting) brings with it a purposiveness in its form by which
4026: the object seems to be, as it were, pre-adapted to our Judgement, and
4027: thus constitutes in itself an object of satisfaction. On the other
4028: hand, that which excites in us, without any reasoning about it, but in
4029: the mere apprehension of it, the feeling of the sublime, may appear as
4030: regards its form to violate purpose in respect of the Judgement, to be
4031: unsuited to our presentative faculty, and, as it were, to do violence
4032: to the Imagination; and yet it is judged to be only the more sublime.
4033: 
4034: Now from this we may see that in general we express ourselves
4035: incorrectly if we call any _object of nature_ sublime, although we can
4036: quite correctly call many objects of nature beautiful. For how can that
4037: be marked by an expression of approval, which is apprehended in itself
4038: as being a violation of purpose? All that we can say is that the object
4039: is fit for the presentation of a sublimity which can be found in the
4040: mind; for no sensible form can contain the sublime properly so-called.
4041: This concerns only Ideas of the Reason, which, although no adequate
4042: presentation is possible for them, by this inadequacy that admits of
4043: sensible presentation, are aroused and summoned into the mind. Thus the
4044: wide ocean, agitated by the storm, cannot be called sublime. Its aspect
4045: is horrible; and the mind must be already filled with manifold Ideas
4046: if it is to be determined by such an intuition to a feeling itself
4047: sublime, as it is incited to abandon sensibility and to busy itself
4048: with Ideas that involve higher purposiveness.
4049: 
4050: Self-subsisting natural beauty discovers to us a Technic of nature,
4051: which represents it as a system in accordance with laws, the principle
4052: of which we do not find in the whole of our faculty of Understanding.
4053: That principle is the principle of purposiveness, in respect of the use
4054: of our Judgement in regard to phenomena; [which requires] that these
4055: must not be judged as merely belonging to nature in its purposeless
4056: mechanism, but also as belonging to something analogous to art. It,
4057: therefore, actually extends, not indeed our cognition of natural
4058: Objects, but our concept of nature; [which is now not regarded] as
4059: mere mechanism but as art. This leads to profound investigations as to
4060: the possibility of such a form. But in what we are accustomed to call
4061: sublime there is nothing at all that leads to particular objective
4062: principles and forms of nature corresponding to them; so far from it
4063: that for the most part nature excites the Ideas of the sublime in its
4064: chaos or in its wildest and most irregular disorder and desolation,
4065: provided size and might are perceived. Hence, we see that the concept
4066: of the Sublime is not nearly so important or rich in consequences
4067: as the concept of the Beautiful; and that in general it displays
4068: nothing purposive in nature itself, but only in that possible use of
4069: our intuitions of it by which there is produced in us a feeling of
4070: a purposiveness quite independent of nature. We must seek a ground
4071: external to ourselves for the Beautiful of nature; but seek it for
4072: the Sublime merely in ourselves and in our attitude of thought which
4073: introduces sublimity into the representation of nature. This is a
4074: very needful preliminary remark, which quite separates the Ideas of
4075: the sublime from that of a purposiveness of _nature_, and makes the
4076: theory of the sublime a mere appendix to the aesthetical judging of
4077: that purposiveness; because by means of it no particular form is
4078: represented in nature, but there is only developed a purposive use
4079: which the Imagination makes of its representation.
4080: 
4081: 
4082: § 24. _Of the divisions of an investigation into the feeling of the
4083: sublime_
4084: 
4085: As regards the division of the moments of the aesthetical judging of
4086: objects in reference to the feeling of the sublime, the Analytic can
4087: proceed according to the same principle as was adapted in the analysis
4088: of judgements of taste. For as an act of the aesthetical reflective
4089: Judgement, the satisfaction in the Sublime must be represented just as
4090: in the case of the Beautiful,--according to _quantity_ as universally
4091: valid, according to _quality_ as devoid of _interest_, according to
4092: _relation_ as subjective purposiveness, and according to _modality_ as
4093: necessary. And so the method here will not diverge from that of the
4094: preceding section; unless, indeed, we count it a difference that in
4095: the case where the aesthetical Judgement is concerned with the form of
4096: the Object we began with the investigation of its quality, but here,
4097: in view of the formlessness which may belong to what we call sublime,
4098: we shall begin with quantity, as the first moment of the aesthetical
4099: judgement as to the sublime. The reason for this may be seen from the
4100: preceding paragraph.
4101: 
4102: But the analysis of the Sublime involves a division not needed in the
4103: case of the Beautiful, viz. a division into the _mathematically_ and
4104: the _dynamically sublime_.
4105: 
4106: For the feeling of the Sublime brings with it as its characteristic
4107: feature a _movement_ of the mind bound up with the judging of the
4108: object, while in the case of the Beautiful taste presupposes and
4109: maintains the mind in _restful_ contemplation. Now this movement
4110: ought to be judged as subjectively purposive (because the sublime
4111: pleases us), and thus it is referred through the Imagination either
4112: to the _faculty of cognition_ or of _desire_. In either reference
4113: the purposiveness of the given representation ought to be judged
4114: only in respect of this _faculty_ (without purpose or interest); but
4115: in the first case it is ascribed to the Object as a _mathematical_
4116: determination of the Imagination, in the second as _dynamical_. And
4117: hence we have this twofold way of representing the sublime.
4118: 
4119: 
4120: A.--OF THE MATHEMATICALLY SUBLIME
4121: 
4122: 
4123: § 25. _Explanation of the term “sublime”_
4124: 
4125: We call that _sublime_ which is _absolutely great_. But to be great,
4126: and to be a great something are quite different concepts (_magnitudo_
4127: and _quantitas_). In like manner to _say simply_ (_simpliciter_)
4128: that anything is _great_ is quite different from saying that it is
4129: _absolutely great_ (_absolute, non comparative magnum_). The latter
4130: is _what is great beyond all comparison_.--What now is meant by the
4131: expression that anything is great or small or of medium size? It is not
4132: a pure concept of Understanding that is thus signified; still less is
4133: it an intuition of Sense, and just as little is it a concept of Reason,
4134: because it brings with it no principle of cognition. It must therefore
4135: be a concept of Judgement or derived from one; and a subjective
4136: purposiveness of the representation in reference to the Judgement must
4137: lie at its basis. That anything is a magnitude (_quantum_) may be
4138: cognised from the thing itself, without any comparison of it with other
4139: things; viz. if there is a multiplicity of the homogeneous constituting
4140: one thing. But to cognise _how great_ it is always requires some other
4141: magnitude as a measure. But because the judging of magnitude depends
4142: not merely on multiplicity (number), but also on the magnitude of the
4143: unit (the measure), and since, to judge of the magnitude of this latter
4144: again requires another as measure with which it may be compared, we
4145: see that the determination of the magnitude of phenomena can supply no
4146: absolute concept whatever of magnitude, but only a comparative one.
4147: 
4148: If now I say simply that anything is great, it appears that I have no
4149: comparison in view, at least none with an objective measure; because
4150: it is thus not determined at all how great the object is. But although
4151: the standard of comparison is merely subjective, yet the judgement none
4152: the less claims universal assent; “this man is beautiful,” and “he is
4153: tall,” are judgements not limited merely to the judging subject, but,
4154: like theoretical judgements, demanding the assent of every one.
4155: 
4156: In a judgement by which anything is designated simply as great, it
4157: is not merely meant that the object has a magnitude, but that this
4158: magnitude is superior to that of many other objects of the same kind,
4159: without, however, any exact determination of this superiority. Thus
4160: there is always at the basis of our judgement a standard which we
4161: assume as the same for every one; this, however, is not available for
4162: any logical (mathematically definite) judging of magnitude, but only
4163: for aesthetical judging of the same, because it is a merely subjective
4164: standard lying at the basis of the reflective judgement upon
4165: magnitude. It may be empirical, as, _e.g._ the average size of the men
4166: known to us, of animals of a certain kind, trees, houses, mountains,
4167: etc. Or it may be a standard given _a priori_, which through the
4168: defects of the judging subject is limited by the subjective conditions
4169: of presentation _in concreto_; as, _e.g._ in the practical sphere, the
4170: greatness of a certain virtue, or of the public liberty and justice in
4171: a country; or, in the theoretical sphere, the greatness of the accuracy
4172: or the inaccuracy of an observation or measurement that has been made,
4173: etc.
4174: 
4175: Here it is remarkable that, although we have no interest whatever in an
4176: Object,--_i.e._ its existence is indifferent to us,--yet its mere size,
4177: even if it is considered as formless, may bring a satisfaction with it
4178: that is universally communicable, and that consequently involves the
4179: consciousness of a subjective purposiveness in the use of our cognitive
4180: faculty. This is not indeed a satisfaction in the Object (because
4181: it may be formless), as in the case of the Beautiful, in which the
4182: reflective Judgement finds itself purposively determined in reference
4183: to cognition in general; but [a satisfaction] in the extension of the
4184: Imagination by itself.
4185: 
4186: If (under the above limitation) we say simply of an object “it is
4187: great,” this is no mathematically definite judgement but a mere
4188: judgement of reflection upon the representation of it, which is
4189: subjectively purposive for a certain use of our cognitive powers in
4190: the estimation of magnitude; and we always then bind up with the
4191: representation a kind of respect, as also a kind of contempt for what
4192: we simply call “small.” Further, the judging of things as great or
4193: small extends to everything, even to all their characteristics; thus
4194: we describe beauty as great or small. The reason of this is to be
4195: sought in the fact that whatever we present in intuition according to
4196: the precept of the Judgement (and thus represent aesthetically) is
4197: always a phenomenon and thus a quantum.
4198: 
4199: But if we call anything not only great, but absolutely great in every
4200: point of view (great beyond all comparison), _i.e._ sublime, we soon
4201: see that it is not permissible to seek for an adequate standard of this
4202: outside itself, but merely in itself. It is a magnitude which is like
4203: itself alone. It follows hence that the sublime is not to be sought in
4204: the things of nature, but only in our Ideas; but in which of them it
4205: lies must be reserved for the Deduction.
4206: 
4207: The foregoing explanation can be thus expressed: _the sublime is that
4208: in comparison with which everything else is small_. Here we easily see
4209: that nothing can be given in nature, however great it is judged by us
4210: to be, which could not if considered in another relation be reduced
4211: to the infinitely small; and conversely there is nothing so small,
4212: which does not admit of extension by our Imagination to the greatness
4213: of a world, if compared with still smaller standards. Telescopes have
4214: furnished us with abundant material for making the first remark,
4215: microscopes for the second. Nothing, therefore, which can be an object
4216: of the senses, is, considered on this basis, to be called sublime.
4217: But because there is in our Imagination a striving towards infinite
4218: progress, and in our Reason a claim for absolute totality, regarded as
4219: a real Idea, therefore this very inadequateness for that Idea in our
4220: faculty for estimating the magnitude of things of sense, excites in
4221: us the feeling of a supersensible faculty. And it is not the object
4222: of sense, but the use which the Judgement naturally makes of certain
4223: objects on behalf of this latter feeling, that is absolutely great; and
4224: in comparison every other use is small. Consequently it is the state
4225: of mind produced by a certain representation with which the reflective
4226: Judgement is occupied, and not the Object, that is to be called sublime.
4227: 
4228: We may therefore append to the preceding formulas explaining the
4229: sublime this other: _the sublime is that, the mere ability to think
4230: which, shows a faculty of the mind surpassing every standard of Sense_.
4231: 
4232: 
4233: § 26. _Of that estimation of the magnitude of natural things which is
4234: requisite for the Idea of the Sublime_
4235: 
4236: The estimation of magnitude by means of concepts of number (or their
4237: signs in Algebra) is mathematical; but that in mere intuition (by the
4238: measurement of the eye) is aesthetical. Now we can come by definite
4239: concepts of _how great_ a thing is, [only][44] by numbers, of which the
4240: unit is the measure (at all events by series of numbers progressing
4241: to infinity); and so far all logical estimation of magnitude is
4242: mathematical. But since the magnitude of the measure must then be
4243: assumed known, and this again is only to be estimated mathematically
4244: by means of numbers,--the unit of which must be another [smaller]
4245: measure,--we can never have a first or fundamental measure, and
4246: therefore can never have a definite concept of a given magnitude. So
4247: the estimation of the magnitude of the fundamental measure must consist
4248: in this, that we can immediately apprehend it in intuition and use it
4249: by the Imagination for the presentation of concepts of number. That
4250: is, all estimation of the magnitude of the objects of nature is in the
4251: end aesthetical (_i.e._ subjectively and not objectively determined).
4252: 
4253: Now for the mathematical estimation of magnitude there is, indeed, no
4254: maximum (for the power of numbers extends to infinity); but for its
4255: aesthetical estimation there is always a maximum, and of this I say
4256: that if it is judged as the absolute measure than which no greater is
4257: possible subjectively (for the judging subject), it brings with it the
4258: Idea of the sublime and produces that emotion which no mathematical
4259: estimation of its magnitude by means of numbers can bring about (except
4260: so far as the aesthetical fundamental measure remains vividly in the
4261: Imagination). For the former only presents relative magnitude by means
4262: of comparison with others of the same kind; but the latter presents
4263: magnitude absolutely, so far as the mind can grasp it in an intuition.
4264: 
4265: In receiving a quantum into the Imagination by intuition, in order
4266: to be able to use it for a measure or as a unit for the estimation
4267: of magnitude by means of numbers, there are two operations of
4268: the Imagination involved: _apprehension_ (_apprehensio_) and
4269: _comprehension_ (_comprehensio aesthetica_). As to apprehension there
4270: is no difficulty, for it can go on _ad infinitum_; but comprehension
4271: becomes harder the further apprehension advances, and soon attains to
4272: its maximum, viz. the aesthetically greatest fundamental measure for
4273: the estimation of magnitude. For when apprehension has gone so far that
4274: the partial representations of sensuous intuition at first apprehended
4275: begin to vanish in the Imagination, whilst this ever proceeds to the
4276: apprehension of others, then it loses as much on the one side as it
4277: gains on the other; and in comprehension there is a maximum beyond
4278: which it cannot go.
4279: 
4280: Hence can be explained what _Savary_[45] remarks in his account of
4281: Egypt, viz. that we must keep from going very near the Pyramids just
4282: as much as we keep from going too far from them, in order to get the
4283: full emotional effect from their size. For if we are too far away,
4284: the parts to be apprehended (the stones lying one over the other) are
4285: only obscurely represented, and the representation of them produces no
4286: effect upon the aesthetical judgement of the subject. But if we are
4287: very near, the eye requires some time to complete the apprehension of
4288: the tiers from the bottom up to the apex; and then the first tiers are
4289: always partly forgotten before the Imagination has taken in the last,
4290: and so the comprehension of them is never complete.--The same thing
4291: may sufficiently explain the bewilderment or, as it were, perplexity
4292: which, it is said, seizes the spectator on his first entrance into
4293: St. Peter’s at Rome. For there is here a feeling of the inadequacy
4294: of his Imagination for presenting the Ideas of a whole, wherein the
4295: Imagination reaches its maximum, and, in striving to surpass it, sinks
4296: back into itself, by which, however, a kind of emotional satisfaction
4297: is produced.
4298: 
4299: I do not wish to speak as yet of the ground of this satisfaction,
4300: which is bound up with a representation from which we should least
4301: of all expect it, viz. a representation which lets us remark its
4302: inadequacy and consequently its subjective want of purposiveness for
4303: the Judgement in the estimation of magnitude. I only remark that if
4304: the aesthetical judgement is pure (i.e. _mingled with no teleological
4305: judgement_ or judgement of Reason) and is to be given as a completely
4306: suitable example of the Critique of the _aesthetical_ Judgement, we
4307: must not exhibit the sublime in products of art (_e.g._ buildings,
4308: pillars, etc.) where human purpose determines the form as well as
4309: the size; nor yet in things of nature _the concepts of which bring
4310: with them a definite purpose_ (_e.g._ animals with a known natural
4311: destination); but in rude nature (and in this only in so far as it
4312: does not bring with it any charm or emotion produced by actual danger)
4313: merely as containing magnitude. For in this kind of representation
4314: nature contains nothing monstrous (either magnificent or horrible);
4315: the magnitude that is apprehended may be increased as much as you
4316: wish provided it can be comprehended in a whole by the Imagination.
4317: An object is _monstrous_ if by its size it destroys the purpose which
4318: constitutes the concept of it. But the mere presentation of a concept
4319: is called _colossal_, which is almost too great for any presentation
4320: (bordering on the relatively monstrous); because the purpose of
4321: the presentation of a concept is made harder [to realise] by the
4322: intuition of the object being almost too great for our faculty of
4323: apprehension.--A pure judgement upon the sublime must, however, have
4324: no purpose of the Object as its determining ground, if it is to be
4325: aesthetical and not mixed up with any judgement of Understanding or
4326: Reason.
4327: 
4328:        *       *       *       *       *
4329: 
4330: Because everything which is to give disinterested pleasure to the
4331: merely reflective Judgement must bring with the representation
4332: of it, subjective and, as subjective, universally valid
4333: purposiveness--although no purposiveness of the _form_ of the
4334: object lies (as in the case of the Beautiful) at the ground of the
4335: judgement--the question arises “what is this subjective purposiveness?”
4336: And how does it come to be prescribed as the norm by which a ground
4337: for universally valid satisfaction is supplied in the mere estimation
4338: of magnitude, even in that which is forced up to the point where our
4339: faculty of Imagination is inadequate for the presentation of the
4340: concept of magnitude?
4341: 
4342: In the process of combination requisite for the estimation of
4343: magnitude, the Imagination proceeds of itself to infinity without
4344: anything hindering it; but the Understanding guides it by means
4345: of concepts of number, for which the Imagination must furnish the
4346: schema. And in this procedure, as belonging to the logical estimation
4347: of magnitude, there is indeed something objectively purposive,--in
4348: accordance with the concept of a purpose (as all measurement is),--but
4349: nothing purposive and pleasing for the aesthetical Judgement. There is
4350: also in this designed purposiveness nothing which would force us to
4351: push the magnitude of the measure, and consequently the _comprehension_
4352: of the manifold in an intuition, to the bounds of the faculty of
4353: Imagination, or as far as ever this can reach in its presentations.
4354: For in the estimation of magnitude by the Understanding (Arithmetic)
4355: we only go to a certain point whether we push the comprehension of
4356: the units up to the number 10 (as in the decimal scale) or only up to
4357: 4 (as in the quaternary scale); the further production of magnitude
4358: proceeds by combination or, if the quantum is given in intuition, by
4359: apprehension, but merely by way of progression (not of comprehension)
4360: in accordance with an assumed principle of progression. In this
4361: mathematical estimation of magnitude the Understanding is equally
4362: served and contented whether the Imagination chooses for unit a
4363: magnitude that we can take in in a glance, _e.g._ a foot or rod, or a
4364: German mile or even the earth’s diameter,--of which the apprehension
4365: is indeed possible, but not the comprehension in an intuition of the
4366: Imagination (not possible by _comprehensio aesthetica_, although quite
4367: possible by _comprehensio logica_ in a concept of number). In both
4368: cases the logical estimation of magnitude goes on without hindrance to
4369: infinity.
4370: 
4371: But now the mind listens to the voice of Reason which, for every given
4372: magnitude,--even for those that can never be entirely apprehended,
4373: although (in sensible representation) they are judged as entirely
4374: given,--requires totality. Reason consequently desires comprehension in
4375: _one_ intuition, and so the _presentation_ of all these members of a
4376: progressively increasing series. It does not even exempt the infinite
4377: (space and past time) from this requirement; it rather renders it
4378: unavoidable to think the infinite (in the judgement of common Reason)
4379: as _entirely given_ (according to its totality).
4380: 
4381: But the infinite is absolutely (not merely comparatively) great.
4382: Compared with it everything else (of the same kind of magnitudes) is
4383: small. And what is most important is that to be able only to think it
4384: as _a whole_ indicates a faculty of mind which surpasses every standard
4385: of Sense. For [to represent it sensibly] would require a comprehension
4386: having for unit a standard bearing a definite relation, expressible
4387: in numbers, to the infinite; which is impossible. Nevertheless, _the
4388: bare capability of thinking_ this infinite without contradiction
4389: requires in the human mind a faculty itself supersensible. For it
4390: is only by means of this faculty and its Idea of a noumenon,--which
4391: admits of no intuition, but which yet serves as the substrate for the
4392: intuition of the world, as a mere phenomenon,--that the infinite of
4393: the world of sense, in the pure intellectual estimation of magnitude,
4394: can be _completely_ comprehended _under_ a concept, although in the
4395: mathematical estimation of magnitude by means of _concepts of number_
4396: it can never be completely thought. The faculty of being able to think
4397: the infinite of supersensible intuition as given (in its intelligible
4398: substrate), surpasses every standard of sensibility, and is great
4399: beyond all comparison even with the faculty of mathematical estimation;
4400: not of course in a theoretical point of view and on behalf of the
4401: cognitive faculty, but as an extension of the mind which feels itself
4402: able in another (practical) point of view to go beyond the limit of
4403: sensibility.
4404: 
4405: Nature is therefore sublime in those of its phenomena, whose intuition
4406: brings with it the Idea of their infinity. This last can only come by
4407: the inadequacy of the greatest effort of our Imagination to estimate
4408: the magnitude of an object. But now in mathematical estimation of
4409: magnitude the Imagination is equal to providing a sufficient measure
4410: for every object; because the numerical concepts of the Understanding,
4411: by means of progression, can make any measure adequate to any given
4412: magnitude. Therefore it must be the _aesthetical_ estimation of
4413: magnitude in which it is felt that the effort towards comprehension
4414: surpasses the power of the Imagination to grasp in a whole of intuition
4415: the progressive apprehension; and at the same time is perceived the
4416: inadequacy of this faculty, unbounded in its progress, for grasping
4417: and using, for the estimation of magnitude, a fundamental measure
4418: which could be made available by the Understanding with little
4419: trouble. Now the proper unchangeable fundamental measure of nature is
4420: its absolute whole; which, regarding nature as a phenomenon, would
4421: be infinity comprehended. But since this fundamental measure is a
4422: self-contradictory concept (on account of the impossibility of the
4423: absolute totality of an endless progress), that magnitude of a natural
4424: Object, on which the Imagination fruitlessly spends its whole faculty
4425: of comprehension, must carry our concept of nature to a supersensible
4426: substrate (which lies at its basis and also at the basis of our faculty
4427: of thought). As this, however, is great beyond all standards of sense,
4428: it makes us judge as _sublime_, not so much the object, as our own
4429: state of mind in the estimation of it.
4430: 
4431: Therefore, just as the aesthetical Judgement in judging the Beautiful
4432: refers the Imagination in its free play to the _Understanding_, in
4433: order to harmonise it with the _concepts_ of the latter in general
4434: (without any determination of them); so does the same faculty when
4435: judging a thing as Sublime refer itself to the _Reason_ in order that
4436: it may subjectively be in accordance with its _Ideas_ (no matter what
4437: they are):--_i.e._ that it may produce a state of mind conformable
4438: to them and compatible with that brought about by the influence of
4439: definite (practical) Ideas upon feeling.
4440: 
4441: We hence see also that true sublimity must be sought only in the mind
4442: of the [subject] judging, not in the natural Object, the judgement upon
4443: which occasions this state. Who would call sublime, _e.g._ shapeless
4444: mountain masses piled in wild disorder upon each other with their
4445: pyramids of ice, or the gloomy raging sea? But the mind feels itself
4446: elevated in its own judgement if, while contemplating them without
4447: any reference to their form, and abandoning itself to the Imagination
4448: and to the Reason--which although placed in combination with the
4449: Imagination without any definite purpose, merely extends it--it yet
4450: finds the whole power of the Imagination inadequate to its Ideas.
4451: 
4452: Examples of the mathematically Sublime of nature in mere intuition are
4453: all the cases in which we are given, not so much a larger numerical
4454: concept as a large unit for the measure of the Imagination (for
4455: shortening the numerical series). A tree, [the height of] which we
4456: estimate with reference to the height of a man, at all events gives
4457: a standard for a mountain; and if this were a mile high, it would
4458: serve as unit for the number expressive of the earth’s diameter, so
4459: that the latter might be made intuitible. The earth’s diameter [would
4460: supply a unit] for the known planetary system; this again for the
4461: Milky Way; and the immeasurable number of milky way systems called
4462: nebulae,--which presumably constitute a system of the same kind among
4463: themselves--lets us expect no bounds here. Now the Sublime in the
4464: aesthetical judging of an immeasurable whole like this lies not so much
4465: in the greatness of the number [of units], as in the fact that in our
4466: progress we ever arrive at yet greater units. To this the systematic
4467: division of the universe contributes, which represents every magnitude
4468: in nature as small in its turn; and represents our Imagination with
4469: its entire freedom from bounds, and with it Nature, as a mere nothing
4470: in comparison with the Ideas of Reason, if it is sought to furnish a
4471: presentation which shall be adequate to them.
4472: 
4473: 
4474: § 27. _Of the quality of the satisfaction in our judgements upon the
4475: Sublime_
4476: 
4477: The feeling of our incapacity to attain to an Idea, _which is a law for
4478: us_, is RESPECT. Now the Idea of the comprehension of every phenomenon
4479: that can be given us in the intuition of a whole, is an Idea prescribed
4480: to us by a law of Reason, which recognises no other measure, definite,
4481: valid for every one, and invariable, than the absolute whole. But
4482: our Imagination, even in its greatest efforts, in respect of that
4483: comprehension, which we expect from it, of a given object in a whole of
4484: intuition (and thus with reference to the presentation of the Idea of
4485: Reason), exhibits its own limits and inadequacy; although at the same
4486: time it shows that its destination is to make itself adequate to this
4487: Idea regarded as a law. Therefore the feeling of the Sublime in nature
4488: is respect for our own destination, which by a certain subreption we
4489: attribute to an Object of nature (conversion of respect for the Idea of
4490: humanity in our own subject into respect for the Object). This makes
4491: intuitively evident the superiority of the rational determination of
4492: our cognitive faculties to the greatest faculty of our Sensibility.
4493: 
4494: The feeling of the Sublime is therefore a feeling of pain, arising
4495: from the want of accordance between the aesthetical estimation of
4496: magnitude formed by the Imagination and the estimation of the same
4497: formed by Reason. There is at the same time a pleasure thus excited,
4498: arising from the correspondence with rational Ideas of this very
4499: judgement of the inadequacy of our greatest faculty of Sense; in so
4500: far as it is a law for us to strive after these Ideas. In fact it is
4501: for us a law (of Reason), and belongs to our destination, to estimate
4502: as small, in comparison with Ideas of Reason, everything which nature,
4503: regarded as an object of Sense, contains that is great for us; and
4504: that which arouses in us the feeling of this supersensible destination
4505: agrees with that law. Now the greatest effort of the Imagination in
4506: the presentation of the unit for the estimation of magnitude indicates
4507: a reference to something _absolutely great_; and consequently a
4508: reference to the law of Reason, which bids us take this alone as
4509: the supreme measure of magnitude. Therefore the inner perception of
4510: the inadequacy of all sensible standards for rational estimation of
4511: magnitude indicates a correspondence with rational laws; it involves a
4512: pain, which arouses in us the feeling of our supersensible destination,
4513: according to which it is purposive and therefore pleasurable to find
4514: every standard of Sensibility inadequate to the Ideas of Understanding.
4515: 
4516: The mind feels itself _moved_ in the representation of the Sublime
4517: in nature; whilst in aesthetical judgements about the Beautiful it
4518: is in _restful_ contemplation. This movement may (especially in
4519: its beginnings) be compared to a vibration, _i.e._ to a quickly
4520: alternating attraction towards, and repulsion from, the same Object.
4521: The transcendent (towards which the Imagination is impelled in its
4522: apprehension of intuition) is for the Imagination like an abyss in
4523: which it fears to lose itself; but for the rational Idea of the
4524: supersensible it is not transcendent but in conformity with law to
4525: bring about such an effort of the Imagination, and consequently here
4526: there is the same amount of attraction as there was of repulsion for
4527: the mere Sensibility. But the judgement itself always remains in this
4528: case only aesthetical, because--without having any determinate concept
4529: of the Object at its basis--it merely represents the subjective play
4530: of the mental powers (Imagination and Reason) as harmonious through
4531: their very contrast. For just as Imagination and _Understanding_, in
4532: judging of the Beautiful, generate a subjective purposiveness of the
4533: mental powers by means of their harmony, so [here[46]] Imagination and
4534: _Reason_ do so by means of their conflict. That is, they bring about a
4535: feeling that we possess pure self-subsistent Reason, or a faculty for
4536: the estimation of magnitude, whose pre-eminence can be made intuitively
4537: evident only by the inadequacy of that faculty [Imagination] which
4538: is itself unbounded in the presentation of magnitudes (of sensible
4539: objects).
4540: 
4541: The measurement of a space (regarded as apprehension) is at the same
4542: time a description of it, and thus an objective movement in the act
4543: of Imagination and a progress. On the other hand, the comprehension
4544: of the manifold in the unity,--not of thought but of intuition,--and
4545: consequently the comprehension of the successively apprehended
4546: [elements] in one glance, is a regress, which annihilates the condition
4547: of time in this progress of the Imagination and makes _coexistence_
4548: intuitible.[47] It is therefore (since the time-series is a condition
4549: of the internal sense and of an intuition) a subjective movement of
4550: the Imagination, by which it does violence to the internal sense;
4551: this must be the more noticeable, the greater the quantum is which the
4552: Imagination comprehends in one intuition. The effort, therefore, to
4553: receive in one single intuition a measure for magnitudes that requires
4554: an appreciable time to apprehend, is a kind of representation, which,
4555: subjectively considered, is contrary to purpose: but objectively, as
4556: requisite for the estimation of magnitude, it is purposive. Thus that
4557: very violence which is done to the subject through the Imagination is
4558: judged as purposive _in reference to the whole determination_ of the
4559: mind.
4560: 
4561: The _quality_ of the feeling of the Sublime is that it is a feeling
4562: of pain in reference to the faculty by which we judge aesthetically
4563: of an object, which pain, however, is represented at the same time as
4564: purposive. This is possible through the fact that the very incapacity
4565: in question discovers the consciousness of an unlimited faculty of
4566: the same subject, and that the mind can only judge of the latter
4567: aesthetically by means of the former.
4568: 
4569: In the logical estimation of magnitude the impossibility of ever
4570: arriving at absolute totality, by means of the progress of the
4571: measurement of things of the sensible world in time and space, was
4572: cognised as objective, _i.e._ as an impossibility of _thinking_ the
4573: infinite as entirely given; and not as merely subjective or that there
4574: was only an incapacity to _grasp_ it. For there we have not to do with
4575: the degree of comprehension in an intuition, regarded as a measure,
4576: but everything depends on a concept of number. But in aesthetical
4577: estimation of magnitude the concept of number must disappear or be
4578: changed, and the comprehension of the Imagination in reference to the
4579: unit of measure (thus avoiding the concepts of a law of the successive
4580: production of concepts of magnitude) is alone purposive for it.--If now
4581: a magnitude almost reaches the limit of our faculty of comprehension
4582: in an intuition, and yet the Imagination is invited by means of
4583: numerical magnitudes (in respect of which we are conscious that our
4584: faculty is unbounded) to aesthetical comprehension in a greater unit,
4585: then we mentally feel ourselves confined aesthetically within bounds.
4586: But nevertheless the pain in regard to the necessary extension of the
4587: Imagination for accordance with that which is unbounded in our faculty
4588: of Reason, viz. the Idea of the absolute whole, and consequently the
4589: very unpurposiveness of the faculty of Imagination for rational Ideas
4590: and the arousing of them, are represented as purposive. Thus it is that
4591: the aesthetical judgement itself is subjectively purposive for the
4592: Reason as the source of Ideas, _i.e._ as the source of an intellectual
4593: comprehension for which all aesthetical comprehension is small; and
4594: there accompanies the reception of an object as sublime a pleasure,
4595: which is only possible through the medium of a pain.
4596: 
4597: 
4598: B.--OF THE DYNAMICALLY SUBLIME IN NATURE
4599: 
4600: 
4601: § 28. _Of Nature regarded as Might_
4602: 
4603: _Might_ is that which is superior to great hindrances. It is called
4604: _dominion_ if it is superior to the resistance of that which itself
4605: possesses might. Nature considered in an aesthetical judgement as might
4606: that has no dominion over us, is _dynamically sublime_.
4607: 
4608: If nature is to be judged by us as dynamically sublime, it must be
4609: represented as exciting fear (although it is not true conversely
4610: that every object which excites fear is regarded in our aesthetical
4611: judgement as sublime). For in aesthetical judgements (without the aid
4612: of concepts) superiority to hindrances can only be judged according
4613: to the greatness of the resistance. Now that which we are driven to
4614: resist is an evil, and, if we do not find our faculties a match for it,
4615: is an object of fear. Hence nature can be regarded by the aesthetical
4616: Judgement as might, and consequently as dynamically sublime, only so
4617: far as it is considered an object of fear.
4618: 
4619: But we can regard an object as _fearful_, without being afraid _of_
4620: it; viz. if we judge of it in such a way that we merely _think_ a case
4621: in which we would wish to resist it, and yet in which all resistance
4622: would be altogether vain. Thus the virtuous man fears God without being
4623: afraid of Him; because to wish to resist Him and His commandments, he
4624: thinks is a case as to which _he_ need not be anxious. But in every
4625: such case that he thinks as not impossible, he cognises Him as fearful.
4626: 
4627: He who fears can form no judgement about the Sublime in nature; just
4628: as he who is seduced by inclination and appetite can form no judgement
4629: about the Beautiful. The former flies from the sight of an object which
4630: inspires him with awe; and it is impossible to find satisfaction in
4631: a terror that is seriously felt. Hence the pleasurableness arising
4632: from the cessation of an uneasiness is _a state of joy_. But this, on
4633: account of the deliverance from danger [which is involved], is a state
4634: of joy conjoined with the resolve not to expose ourselves to the danger
4635: again; we cannot willingly look back upon our sensations [of danger],
4636: much less seek the occasion for them again.
4637: 
4638: Bold, overhanging, and as it were threatening, rocks; clouds piled up
4639: in the sky, moving with lightning flashes and thunder peals; volcanoes
4640: in all their violence of destruction; hurricanes with their track
4641: of devastation; the boundless ocean in a state of tumult; the lofty
4642: waterfall of a mighty river, and such like; these exhibit our faculty
4643: of resistance as insignificantly small in comparison with their might.
4644: But the sight of them is the more attractive, the more fearful it
4645: is, provided only that we are in security; and we readily call these
4646: objects sublime, because they raise the energies of the soul above
4647: their accustomed height, and discover in us a faculty of resistance of
4648: a quite different kind, which gives us courage to measure ourselves
4649: against the apparent almightiness of nature.
4650: 
4651: Now, in the immensity of nature, and in the inadequacy of our faculties
4652: for adopting a standard proportionate to the aesthetical estimation of
4653: the magnitude of its _realm_, we find our own limitation; although at
4654: the same time in our rational faculty we find a different, non-sensuous
4655: standard, which has that infinity itself under it as a unit, and in
4656: comparison with which everything in nature is small. Thus in our mind
4657: we find a superiority to nature even in its immensity. And so also
4658: the irresistibility of its might, while making us recognise our own
4659: [physical[48]] impotence, considered as beings of nature, discloses
4660: to us a faculty of judging independently of, and a superiority over,
4661: nature; on which is based a kind of self-preservation, entirely
4662: different from that which can be attacked and brought into danger by
4663: external nature. Thus, humanity in our person remains unhumiliated,
4664: though the individual might have to submit to this dominion. In this
4665: way nature is not judged to be sublime in our aesthetical judgements,
4666: in so far as it excites fear; but because it calls up that power in
4667: us (which is not nature) of regarding as small the things about which
4668: we are solicitous (goods, health, and life), and of regarding its
4669: might (to which we are no doubt subjected in respect of these things),
4670: as nevertheless without any dominion over us and our personality to
4671: which we must bow where our highest fundamental propositions, and
4672: their assertion or abandonment, are concerned. Therefore nature is
4673: here called sublime merely because it elevates the Imagination to a
4674: presentation of those cases in which the mind can make felt the proper
4675: sublimity of its destination, in comparison with nature itself.
4676: 
4677: This estimation of ourselves loses nothing through the fact that
4678: we must regard ourselves as safe in order to feel this inspiriting
4679: satisfaction; and that hence, as there is no seriousness in the
4680: danger, there might be also (as might seem to be the case) just as
4681: little seriousness in the sublimity of our spiritual faculty. For
4682: the satisfaction here concerns only the _destination_ of our faculty
4683: which discloses itself in such a case, so far as the tendency to this
4684: destination lies in our nature, whilst its development and exercise
4685: remain incumbent and obligatory. And in this there is truth, however
4686: conscious the man may be of his present actual powerlessness, when he
4687: stretches his reflection so far.
4688: 
4689: No doubt this principle seems to be too far-fetched and too subtly
4690: reasoned, and consequently seems to go beyond the scope of an
4691: aesthetical judgement; but observation of men proves the opposite, and
4692: shows that it may lie at the root of the most ordinary judgements,
4693: although we are not always conscious of it. For what is that which is,
4694: even to the savage, an object of the greatest admiration? It is a man
4695: who shrinks from nothing, who fears nothing, and therefore does not
4696: yield to danger, but rather goes to face it vigorously with the fullest
4697: deliberation. Even in the most highly civilised state this peculiar
4698: veneration for the soldier remains, though only under the condition
4699: that he exhibit all the virtues of peace, gentleness, compassion, and
4700: even a becoming care for his own person; because even by these it
4701: is recognised that his mind is unsubdued by danger. Hence whatever
4702: disputes there may be about the superiority of the respect which is
4703: to be accorded them, in the comparison of a statesman and a general,
4704: the aesthetical judgement decides for the latter. War itself, if it
4705: is carried on with order and with a sacred respect for the rights of
4706: citizens, has something sublime in it, and makes the disposition of the
4707: people who carry it on thus, only the more sublime, the more numerous
4708: are the dangers to which they are exposed, and in respect of which
4709: they behave with courage. On the other hand, a long peace generally
4710: brings about a predominant commercial spirit, and along with it, low
4711: selfishness, cowardice, and effeminacy, and debases the disposition of
4712: the people.[49]
4713: 
4714: It appears to conflict with this solution of the concept of the
4715: sublime, so far as sublimity is ascribed to might, that we are
4716: accustomed to represent God as presenting Himself in His wrath and
4717: yet in His sublimity, in the tempest, the storm, the earthquake, etc.;
4718: and that it would be foolish and criminal to imagine a superiority of
4719: our minds over these works of His, and, as it seems, even over the
4720: designs of such might. Hence it would appear that no feeling of the
4721: sublimity of our own nature, but rather subjection, abasement, and a
4722: feeling of complete powerlessness, is a fitting state of mind before
4723: the manifestation of such an object, and this is generally bound up
4724: with the Idea of it during natural phenomena of this kind. Generally in
4725: religion, prostration, adoration with bent head, with contrite, anxious
4726: demeanour and voice, seems to be the only fitting behaviour in presence
4727: of the Godhead; and hence most peoples have adopted and still observe
4728: it. But this state of mind is far from being necessarily bound up with
4729: the Idea of the _sublimity_ of a religion and its object. The man who
4730: is actually afraid, because he finds reasons for fear in himself,
4731: whilst conscious by his culpable disposition of offending against a
4732: Might whose will is irresistible and at the same time just, is not in
4733: the frame of mind for admiring the divine greatness. For this a mood of
4734: calm contemplation and a quite free judgement are needed. Only if he is
4735: conscious of an upright disposition pleasing to God do those operations
4736: of might serve to awaken in him the Idea of the sublimity of this
4737: Being, for then he recognises in himself a sublimity of disposition
4738: conformable to His will; and thus he is raised above the fear of such
4739: operations of nature, which he no longer regards as outbursts of His
4740: wrath. Even humility, in the shape of a stern judgement upon his own
4741: faults,--which otherwise, with a consciousness of good intentions,
4742: could be easily palliated from the frailty of human nature,--is a
4743: sublime state of mind, consisting in a voluntary subjection of himself
4744: to the pain of remorse, in order that its causes may be gradually
4745: removed. In this way religion is essentially distinguished from
4746: superstition. The latter establishes in the mind, not reverence for the
4747: Sublime, but fear and apprehension of the all-powerful Being to whose
4748: will the terrified man sees himself subject, without according Him any
4749: high esteem. From this nothing can arise but a seeking of favour, and
4750: flattery, instead of a religion which consists in a good life.[50]
4751: 
4752: Sublimity, therefore, does not reside in anything of nature, but only
4753: in our mind, in so far as we can become conscious that we are superior
4754: to nature within, and therefore also to nature without us (so far
4755: as it influences us). Everything that excites this feeling in us,
4756: _e.g._ the _might_ of nature which calls forth our forces, is called
4757: then (although improperly) sublime. Only by supposing this Idea in
4758: ourselves, and in reference to it, are we capable of attaining to the
4759: Idea of the sublimity of that Being, which produces respect in us, not
4760: merely by the might that it displays in nature, but rather by means
4761: of the faculty which resides in us of judging it fearlessly and of
4762: regarding our destination as sublime in respect of it.
4763: 
4764: 
4765: § 29. _Of the modality of the judgement upon the sublime in nature_
4766: 
4767: There are numberless beautiful things in nature about which we can
4768: assume and even expect, without being far mistaken, the harmony of
4769: every one’s judgement with our own. But in respect of our judgement
4770: upon the sublime in nature, we cannot promise ourselves so easily
4771: the accordance of others. For a far greater culture, as well of the
4772: aesthetical Judgement as of the cognitive faculties which lie at its
4773: basis, seems requisite in order to be able to pass judgement on this
4774: pre-eminent quality of natural objects.
4775: 
4776: That the mind be attuned to feel the sublime postulates a
4777: susceptibility of the mind for Ideas. For in the very inadequacy of
4778: nature to these latter, and thus only by presupposing them and by
4779: straining the Imagination to use nature as a schema for them, is to
4780: be found that which is terrible to sensibility and yet is attractive.
4781: [It is attractive] because Reason exerts a dominion over sensibility
4782: in order to extend it in conformity with its own realm (the practical)
4783: and to make it look out into the Infinite, which is for it an abyss. In
4784: fact, without development of moral Ideas, that which we, prepared by
4785: culture, call sublime, presents itself to the uneducated man merely as
4786: terrible. In the indications of the dominion of nature in destruction,
4787: and in the great scale of its might, in comparison with which his own
4788: is a vanishing quantity, he will only see the misery, danger, and
4789: distress which surround the man who is exposed to it. So the good,
4790: and indeed intelligent, Savoyard peasant (as Herr von _Saussure_[51]
4791: relates) unhesitatingly called all lovers of snow-mountains fools. And
4792: who knows, whether he would have been so completely wrong, if Saussure
4793: had undertaken the danger to which he exposed himself merely, as most
4794: travellers do, from amateur curiosity, or that he might be able to give
4795: a pathetic account of them? But his design was the instruction of men;
4796: and this excellent man gave the readers of his Travels, soul-stirring
4797: sensations such as he himself had, into the bargain.
4798: 
4799: But although the judgement upon the Sublime in nature needs culture
4800: (more than the judgement upon the Beautiful), it is not therefore
4801: primarily produced by culture and introduced in a merely conventional
4802: way into society. Rather has it root in human nature, even in that
4803: which, alike with common Understanding, we can impute to and expect of
4804: every one, viz. in the tendency to the feeling for (practical) Ideas,
4805: _i.e._ to the moral feeling.
4806: 
4807: Hereon is based the necessity of that agreement of the judgement of
4808: others about the sublime with our own which we include in the latter.
4809: For just as we charge with want of _taste_ the man who is indifferent
4810: when passing judgement upon an object of nature that we regard as
4811: beautiful; so we say of him who remains unmoved in the presence of that
4812: which we judge to be sublime, he has no _feeling_. But we claim both
4813: from every man, and we presuppose them in him if he has any culture at
4814: all; only with the difference, that we expect the former directly of
4815: every one, because in it the Judgement refers the Imagination merely to
4816: the Understanding, the faculty of concepts; but the latter, because
4817: in it the Imagination is related to the Reason, the faculty of Ideas,
4818: only under a subjective presupposition (which, however, we believe we
4819: are authorised in imputing to every one), viz. the presupposition of
4820: the moral feeling [in man.[52]] Thus it is that we ascribe necessity to
4821: this aesthetical judgement also.
4822: 
4823: In this modality of aesthetical judgements, viz. in the necessity
4824: claimed for them, lies an important moment of the Critique of
4825: Judgement. For it enables us to recognise in them an _a priori_
4826: principle, and raises them out of empirical psychology, in which
4827: otherwise they would remain buried amongst the feelings of
4828: gratification and grief (only with the unmeaning addition of being
4829: called _finer_ feelings). Thus it enables us too to place the Judgement
4830: among those faculties that have _a priori_ principles at their basis,
4831: and so to bring it into Transcendental Philosophy.
4832: 
4833: 
4834: 
4835: 
4836: GENERAL REMARK UPON THE EXPOSITION OF THE AESTHETICAL REFLECTIVE
4837: JUDGEMENT
4838: 
4839: 
4840: In reference to the feeling of pleasure an object is to be classified
4841: as either _pleasant_, or _beautiful_, or _sublime_, or _good_
4842: (absolutely), (_jucundum_, _pulchrum_, _sublime_, _honestum_).
4843: 
4844: The _pleasant_, as motive of desire, is always of one and the same
4845: kind, no matter whence it comes and however specifically different
4846: the representation (of sense, and sensation objectively considered)
4847: may be. Hence in judging its influence on the mind, account is taken
4848: only of the number of its charms (simultaneous and successive), and
4849: so only of the mass, as it were, of the pleasant sensation; and this
4850: can be made intelligible only by _quantity_. It has no reference
4851: to culture, but belongs to mere enjoyment.--On the other hand, the
4852: _beautiful_ requires the representation of a certain _quality_ of
4853: the Object, that can be made intelligible and reduced to concepts
4854: (although it is not so reduced in an aesthetical judgement); and it
4855: cultivates us, in that it teaches us to attend to the purposiveness
4856: in the feeling of pleasure.--The _sublime_ consists merely in the
4857: _relation_ by which the sensible in the representation of nature is
4858: judged available for a possible supersensible use.--The _absolutely
4859: good_, subjectively judged according to the feeling that it inspires
4860: (the Object of the moral feeling), as capable of determining the powers
4861: of the subject through the representation of an _absolutely compelling_
4862: law, is specially distinguished by the _modality_ of a necessity that
4863: rests _a priori_ upon concepts. This necessity involves not merely
4864: a _claim_, but a _command_ for the assent of every one, and belongs
4865: in itself to the pure intellectual, rather than to the aesthetical
4866: Judgement; and is by a determinant and not a mere reflective judgement
4867: ascribed not to Nature but to Freedom. But the _determinability of
4868: the subject_ by means of this Idea, and especially of a subject
4869: that can feel _hindrances_ in sensibility, and at the same time its
4870: superiority to them by their subjugation involving a _modification of
4871: its state_--_i.e._ the moral feeling,--is yet so far cognate to the
4872: aesthetical Judgement and its formal conditions that it can serve to
4873: represent the conformity to law of action from duty as aesthetical,
4874: _i.e._ as sublime or even as beautiful, without losing its purity. This
4875: would not be so, if we were to put it in natural combination with the
4876: feeling of the pleasant.
4877: 
4878: If we take the result of the foregoing exposition of the two kinds
4879: of aesthetical judgements, there arise therefrom the following short
4880: explanations:
4881: 
4882: The _Beautiful_ is what pleases in the mere judgement (and therefore
4883: not by the medium of sensation in accordance with a concept of the
4884: Understanding). It follows at once from this that it must please apart
4885: from all interest.
4886: 
4887: The _Sublime_ is what pleases immediately through its opposition to the
4888: interest of sense.
4889: 
4890: Both, as explanations of aesthetical universally valid judging,
4891: are referred to subjective grounds; in the one case to grounds of
4892: sensibility, in favour of the contemplative Understanding; in the other
4893: case _in opposition to_ sensibility, but on behalf of the purposes
4894: of practical Reason. Both, however, united in the same subject, are
4895: purposive in reference to the moral feeling. The Beautiful prepares
4896: us to love disinterestedly something, even nature itself; the Sublime
4897: prepares us to esteem something highly even in opposition to our own
4898: (sensible) interest.
4899: 
4900: We may describe the Sublime thus: it is an object (of nature)
4901: _the representation of which determines the mind to think the
4902: unattainability of nature regarded as a presentation of Ideas_.
4903: 
4904: Literally taken and logically considered, Ideas cannot be presented.
4905: But if we extend our empirical representative faculty (mathematically
4906: or dynamically) to the intuition of nature, Reason inevitably
4907: intervenes, as the faculty expressing the independence of absolute
4908: totality,[53] and generates the effort of the mind, vain though it
4909: be, to make the representation of the senses adequate to this. This
4910: effort,--and the feeling of the unattainability of the Idea by means
4911: of the Imagination,--is itself a presentation of the subjective
4912: purposiveness of our mind in the employment of the Imagination for
4913: its supersensible destination; and forces us, subjectively, to
4914: _think_ nature itself in its totality as a presentation of something
4915: supersensible, without being able _objectively_ to arrive at this
4916: presentation.
4917: 
4918: For we soon see that nature in space and time entirely lacks the
4919: unconditioned, and, consequently, that absolute magnitude, which yet is
4920: desired by the most ordinary Reason. It is by this that we are reminded
4921: that we only have to do with nature as phenomenon, and that it must
4922: be regarded as the mere presentation of a nature in itself (of which
4923: Reason has the Idea). But this Idea of the supersensible, which we can
4924: no further determine,--so that we cannot _know_ but only _think_ nature
4925: as its presentation,--is awakened in us by means of an object, whose
4926: aesthetical appreciation strains the Imagination to its utmost bounds,
4927: whether of extension (mathematical) or of its might over the mind
4928: (dynamical). And this judgement is based upon a feeling of the mind’s
4929: destination, which entirely surpasses the realm of the former (_i.e._
4930: upon the moral feeling), in respect of which the representation of the
4931: object is judged as subjectively purposive.
4932: 
4933: In fact, a feeling for the Sublime in nature cannot well be thought
4934: without combining therewith a mental disposition which is akin to the
4935: Moral. And although the immediate pleasure in the Beautiful of nature
4936: likewise presupposes and cultivates a certain _liberality_ in our
4937: mental attitude, _i.e._ a satisfaction independent of mere sensible
4938: enjoyment, yet freedom is thus represented as in _play_ rather than
4939: in that law-directed _occupation_ which is the genuine characteristic
4940: of human morality, in which Reason must exercise dominion over
4941: Sensibility. But in aesthetical judgements upon the Sublime this
4942: dominion is represented as exercised by the Imagination, regarded as an
4943: instrument of Reason.
4944: 
4945: The satisfaction in the Sublime of nature is then only _negative_
4946: (whilst that in the Beautiful is _positive_); viz. a feeling that the
4947: Imagination is depriving itself of its freedom, while it is purposively
4948: determined according to a different law from that of its empirical
4949: employment. It thus acquires an extension and a might greater than it
4950: sacrifices,--the ground of which, however, is concealed from itself;
4951: whilst yet it _feels_ the sacrifice or the deprivation and, at the
4952: same time, the cause to which it is subjected. _Astonishment_, that
4953: borders upon terror, the dread and the holy awe which seizes the
4954: observer at the sight of mountain peaks rearing themselves to heaven,
4955: deep chasms and streams raging therein, deep-shadowed solitudes that
4956: dispose one to melancholy meditations--this, in the safety in which we
4957: know ourselves to be, is not actual fear, but only an attempt to feel
4958: fear by the aid of the Imagination; that we may feel the might of this
4959: faculty in combining with the mind’s repose the mental movement thereby
4960: excited, and being thus superior to internal nature,--and therefore
4961: to external,--so far as this can have any influence on our feeling of
4962: well-being. For the Imagination by the laws of Association makes our
4963: state of contentment dependent on physical [causes]; but it also,
4964: by the principles of the Schematism of the Judgement (being so far,
4965: therefore, ranked under freedom), is the instrument of Reason and its
4966: Ideas, and, as such, has might to maintain our independence of natural
4967: influences, to regard as small what in reference to them is great, and
4968: so to place the absolutely great only in the proper destination of the
4969: subject. The raising of this reflection of the aesthetical Judgement
4970: so as to be adequate to Reason (though without a definite concept of
4971: Reason) represents the object as subjectively purposive, even by the
4972: objective want of accordance between the Imagination in its greatest
4973: extension and the Reason (as the faculty of Ideas).
4974: 
4975: We must here, generally, attend to what has been already noted, that
4976: in the Transcendental Aesthetic of Judgement we must speak solely of
4977: pure aesthetical judgements; consequently our examples are not to be
4978: taken from such beautiful or sublime objects of Nature as presuppose
4979: the concept of a purpose. For, if so, the purposiveness would be
4980: either teleological, or would be based on mere sensations of an object
4981: (gratification or grief); and thus would be in the former case not
4982: aesthetical, in the latter not merely formal. If then we call the sight
4983: of the starry heaven _sublime_, we must not place at the basis of our
4984: judgement concepts of worlds inhabited by rational beings, and regard
4985: the bright points, with which we see the space above us filled, as
4986: their suns moving in circles purposively fixed with reference to them;
4987: but we must regard it, just as we see it, as a distant, all-embracing
4988: vault. Only under such a representation can we range that sublimity
4989: which a pure aesthetical judgement ascribes to this object. And in
4990: the same way, if we are to call the sight of the ocean sublime, we
4991: must not _think_ of it as we [ordinarily] do, endowed as we are with
4992: all kinds of knowledge (not contained, however, in the immediate
4993: intuition). For example, we sometimes think of the ocean as a vast
4994: kingdom of aquatic creatures; or as the great source of those vapours
4995: that fill the air with clouds for the benefit of the land; or again
4996: as an element which, though dividing continents from each other, yet
4997: promotes the greatest communication between them: but these furnish
4998: merely teleological judgements. To call the ocean sublime we must
4999: regard it as poets do, merely by what strikes the eye; if it is at
5000: rest, as a clear mirror of water only bounded by the heaven; if it is
5001: restless, as an abyss threatening to overwhelm everything. The like is
5002: to be said of the Sublime and Beautiful in the human figure. We must
5003: not regard as the determining grounds of our judgement the concepts
5004: of the purposes which all our limbs serve, and we must not allow this
5005: coincidence to _influence_ our aesthetical judgement (for then it would
5006: no longer be pure); although it is certainly a necessary condition of
5007: aesthetical satisfaction that there should be no conflict between them.
5008: Aesthetical purposiveness is the conformity to law of the Judgement in
5009: its _freedom_. The satisfaction in the object depends on the relation
5010: in which we wish to place the Imagination; always provided that it by
5011: itself entertains the mind in free occupation. If, on the other hand,
5012: the judgement be determined by anything else,--whether sensation or
5013: concept,--although it may be conformable to law, it cannot be the act
5014: of a _free_ Judgement.
5015: 
5016: If then we speak of intellectual beauty or sublimity, these expressions
5017: are, _first_, not quite accurate, because beauty and sublimity are
5018: aesthetical modes of representation, which would not be found in us at
5019: all if we were pure intelligences (or even regarded ourselves as such
5020: in thought). _Secondly_, although both, as objects of an intellectual
5021: (moral) satisfaction, are so far compatible with aesthetical
5022: satisfaction that they _rest_ upon no interest, yet they are difficult
5023: to unite with it, because they are meant to _produce_ an interest.
5024: This, if its presentation is to harmonise with the satisfaction in the
5025: aesthetical judgement, could only arise by means of a sensible interest
5026: that we combine with it in the presentation; and thus damage would be
5027: done to the intellectual purposiveness, and it would lose its purity.
5028: 
5029: The object of a pure and unconditioned intellectual satisfaction is
5030: the Moral Law in that might which it exercises in us over all mental
5031: motives _that precede it_. This might only makes itself aesthetically
5032: known to us through sacrifices (which causing a feeling of deprivation,
5033: though on behalf of internal freedom, in return discloses in us an
5034: unfathomable depth of this supersensible faculty, with consequences
5035: extending beyond our ken); thus the satisfaction on the aesthetical
5036: side (in relation to sensibility) is negative, _i.e._ against this
5037: interest, but regarded from the intellectual side it is positive and
5038: combined with an interest. Hence it follows that the intellectual,
5039: in itself purposive, (moral) good, aesthetically judged, must be
5040: represented as sublime rather than beautiful, so that it rather awakens
5041: the feeling of respect (which disdains charm) than that of love and
5042: familiar inclination; for human nature does not attach itself to this
5043: good spontaneously, but only by the authority which Reason exercises
5044: over Sensibility. Conversely also, that which we call sublime in
5045: nature, whether external or internal (_e.g._ certain affections), is
5046: only represented as a might in the mind to overcome [_certain_][54]
5047: hindrances of the Sensibility by means of moral fundamental
5048: propositions, and only thus does it interest.
5049: 
5050: I will dwell a moment on this latter point. The Idea of the Good
5051: conjoined with affection is called _enthusiasm_. This state of mind
5052: seems to be sublime, to the extent that we commonly assert that
5053: nothing great could be done without it. Now every affection[55] is
5054: blind, either in the choice of its purpose, or, if this be supplied
5055: by Reason, in its accomplishment; for it is a mental movement which
5056: makes it impossible to exercise a free deliberation about fundamental
5057: propositions so as to determine ourselves thereby. It can therefore in
5058: no way deserve the approval of the Reason. Nevertheless, aesthetically,
5059: enthusiasm is sublime, because it is a tension of forces produced
5060: by Ideas, which give an impulse to the mind, that operates far more
5061: powerfully and lastingly than the impulse arising from sensible
5062: representations. But (which seems strange) the _absence of affection_
5063: (_apatheia, phlegma in significatu bono_) in a mind that vigorously
5064: follows its unalterable principles is sublime, and in a far preferable
5065: way, because it has also on its side the satisfaction of pure
5066: Reason.[56] It is only a mental state of this kind that is called
5067: noble; and this expression is subsequently applied to things, _e.g._ a
5068: building, a garment, literary style, bodily presence, etc., when these
5069: do not so much arouse _astonishment_ (the affection produced by the
5070: representation of novelty exceeding our expectations), as _admiration_
5071: (astonishment that does not cease when the novelty disappears); and
5072: this is the case when Ideas agree in their presentation undesignedly
5073: and artlessly with the aesthetical satisfaction.
5074: 
5075: Every affection of the STRENUOUS kind (viz. that excites the
5076: consciousness of our power to overcome every obstacle--_animi strenui_)
5077: is _aesthetically sublime_, _e.g._ wrath, even despair (_i.e._ the
5078: despair of _indignation_, not of _faintheartedness_). But affections of
5079: the LANGUID kind (which make the very effort of resistance an object
5080: of pain--_animum languidum_) have nothing _noble_ in themselves, but
5081: they may be reckoned under the sensuously beautiful. _Emotions_,
5082: which may rise to the strength of affections, are very different.
5083: We have both _spirited_ and _tender_ emotions. The latter, if they
5084: rise to the height of affections, are worthless; the propensity to
5085: them is called _sentimentality_. A sympathetic grief that will not
5086: admit of consolation, or one referring to imaginary evils to which
5087: we deliberately surrender ourselves--being deceived by fancy--as if
5088: they were actual, indicates and produces a tender,[57] though weak,
5089: soul--which shows a beautiful side and which can be called fanciful,
5090: though not enthusiastic. Romances, lacrymose plays, shallow moral
5091: precepts, which toy with (falsely) so-called moral dispositions, but
5092: in fact make the heart languid, insensible to the severe precept of
5093: duty, and incapable of all respect for the worth of humanity in our
5094: own person, and for the rights of men (a very different thing from
5095: their happiness), and in general incapable of all steady principle;
5096: even a religious discourse,[58] which recommends a cringing, abject
5097: seeking of favour and ingratiation of ourselves, which proposes the
5098: abandonment of all confidence in our own faculties in opposition to
5099: the evil within us, instead of a sturdy resolution to endeavour to
5100: overcome our inclinations by means of those powers which with all our
5101: frailty yet remain to us; that false humility which sets the only
5102: way of pleasing the Supreme Being in self-depreciation, in whining
5103: hypocritical repentance and in a mere passive state of mind--these are
5104: not compatible with any frame of mind that can be counted beautiful,
5105: still less with one which is to be counted sublime.
5106: 
5107: But even stormy movements of mind which may be connected under the
5108: name of edification with Ideas of religion, or--as merely belonging
5109: to culture--with Ideas containing a social interest, can in no way,
5110: however they strain the Imagination, lay claim to the honour of
5111: being _sublime_ presentations, unless they leave after them a mental
5112: mood which, although only indirectly, has influence upon the mind’s
5113: consciousness of its strength, and its resolution in reference to that
5114: which involves pure intellectual purposiveness (the supersensible). For
5115: otherwise all these emotions belong only to _motion_, which one would
5116: fain enjoy for the sake of health. The pleasant exhaustion, consequent
5117: upon such disturbance produced by the play of the affections, is an
5118: enjoyment of our well-being arising from the restored equilibrium of
5119: the various vital forces. This in the end amounts to the same thing as
5120: that state which Eastern voluptuaries find so delightful, when they
5121: get their bodies as it were kneaded and all their muscles and joints
5122: softly pressed and bent; only that in this case the motive principle
5123: is for the most part external, in the other case it is altogether
5124: internal. Many a man believes himself to be edified by a sermon, when
5125: indeed there is no edification at all (no system of good maxims); or
5126: to be improved by a tragedy, when he is only glad at his ennui being
5127: happily dispelled. So the Sublime must always have reference to the
5128: _disposition_, _i.e._ to the maxims which furnish to the intellectual
5129: [part] and to the Ideas of Reason a superiority over sensibility.
5130: 
5131: We need not fear that the feeling of the sublime will lose by so
5132: abstract a mode of presentation,--which is quite negative in respect
5133: of what is sensible,--for the Imagination, although it finds nothing
5134: beyond the sensible to which it can attach itself, yet feels itself
5135: unbounded by this removal of its limitations; and thus that very
5136: abstraction is a presentation of the Infinite, which can be nothing
5137: but a mere negative presentation, but which yet expands the soul.
5138: Perhaps there is no sublimer passage in the Jewish Law than the
5139: command, _Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor the
5140: likeness of anything which is in heaven or on the earth or under the
5141: earth_, etc. This command alone can explain the enthusiasm that the
5142: Jewish people in their moral period felt for their religion, when they
5143: compared themselves with other peoples; or explain the pride which
5144: Mahommedanism inspires. The same is true of the moral law and of the
5145: tendency to morality in us. It is quite erroneous to fear that if we
5146: deprive this [tendency] of all that can recommend it to sense it will
5147: only involve a cold lifeless assent and no moving force or emotion. It
5148: is quite the other way, for where the senses see nothing more before
5149: them, and the unmistakable and indelible Idea of morality remains,
5150: it would be rather necessary to moderate the impetus of an unbounded
5151: Imagination, to prevent it from rising to enthusiasm, than through fear
5152: of the powerlessness of these Ideas to seek aid for them in images and
5153: childish ritual. Thus governments have willingly allowed religion to be
5154: abundantly provided with the latter accessories; and seeking thereby
5155: to relieve their subjects of trouble, they have also sought to deprive
5156: them of the faculty of extending their spiritual powers beyond the
5157: limits that are arbitrarily assigned to them, and by means of which
5158: they can be the more easily treated as mere passive[59] beings.
5159: 
5160: This pure, elevating, merely negative presentation of morality brings
5161: with it, on the other hand, no danger of _fanaticism_, which is _a
5162: delusion that we can will ourselves to see something beyond all bounds
5163: of sensibility_, _i.e._ to dream in accordance with fundamental
5164: propositions (or to go mad with Reason); and this is so just because
5165: this presentation is merely negative. For the _inscrutableness of the
5166: Idea of Freedom_ quite cuts it off from any positive presentation; but
5167: the moral law is in itself sufficiently and originally determinant
5168: in us, so that it does not permit us to cast a glance at any ground
5169: of determination external to itself. If enthusiasm is comparable to
5170: _madness_, fanaticism is comparable to _monomania_; of which the latter
5171: is least of all compatible with the sublime, because in its detail it
5172: is ridiculous. In enthusiasm, regarded as an affection, the Imagination
5173: is without bridle; in fanaticism, regarded as an inveterate, brooding
5174: passion, it is without rule. The first is a transitory accident which
5175: sometimes befalls the soundest Understanding; the second is a disease
5176: which unsettles it.
5177: 
5178: _Simplicity_ (purposiveness without art) is as it were the style of
5179: Nature in the sublime, and so also of Morality which is a second
5180: (supersensible) nature; of which we only know the laws without being
5181: able to reach by intuition that supersensible faculty in ourselves
5182: which contains the ground of the legislation.
5183: 
5184: Now the satisfaction in the Beautiful, like that in the Sublime,
5185: is not alone distinguishable from other aesthetical judgements by
5186: its universal _communicability_, but also because, through this
5187: very property, it acquires an interest in reference to society (in
5188: which this communication is possible). We must, however, remark that
5189: _separation from all society_ is regarded as sublime, if it rests
5190: upon Ideas that overlook all sensible interest. To be sufficient for
5191: oneself, and consequently to have no need of society, without at the
5192: same time being unsociable, _i.e._ without flying from it, is something
5193: bordering on the sublime; as is any dispensing with wants. On the other
5194: hand, to fly from men from _misanthropy_, because we bear ill-will to
5195: them, or from _anthropophoby_ (shyness), because we fear them as foes,
5196: is partly hateful, partly contemptible. There is indeed a misanthropy
5197: (very improperly so-called), the tendency to which frequently appears
5198: with old age in many right-thinking men; which is philanthropic enough
5199: as far as _goodwill_ to men is concerned, but which through long and
5200: sad experience is far removed from _satisfaction_ with men. Evidence of
5201: this is afforded by the propensity to solitude, the fantastic wish for
5202: a secluded country seat, or (in the case of young persons) by the dream
5203: of the happiness of passing one’s life with a little family upon some
5204: island unknown to the rest of the world; a dream of which story-tellers
5205: or writers of Robinsonades know how to make good use. Falsehood,
5206: ingratitude, injustice, the childishness of the purposes regarded by
5207: ourselves as important and great, in the pursuit of which men inflict
5208: upon each other all imaginable evils, are so contradictory to the Idea
5209: of what men might be if they would, and conflict so with our lively
5210: wish to see them better, that, in order that we may not hate them
5211: (since we cannot love them), the renunciation of all social joys seems
5212: but a small sacrifice. This sadness--not the sadness (of which sympathy
5213: is the cause) for the evils which fate brings upon others,--but for
5214: those things which men do to one another (which depends upon an
5215: antipathy in fundamental propositions), is sublime, because it rests
5216: upon Ideas, whilst the former can only count as beautiful.--The
5217: brilliant and thorough _Saussure_,[60] in his account of his Alpine
5218: travels, says of one of the Savoy mountains, called _Bonhomme_, “There
5219: reigns there a certain _insipid sadness_.” He therefore recognised an
5220: _interesting_ sadness, that the sight of a solitude might inspire, to
5221: which men might wish to transport themselves that they might neither
5222: hear nor experience any more of the world; which, however, would not
5223: be quite so inhospitable that it would offer only an extremely painful
5224: retreat.--I make this remark solely with the design of indicating
5225: again that even depression (not dejected sadness) may be counted among
5226: the _sturdy_ affections, if it has its ground in moral Ideas. But if it
5227: is grounded on sympathy and, as such, is amiable, it belongs merely to
5228: the _languid_ affections. [I make this remark] to call attention to the
5229: state of mind which is _sublime_ only in the first case.

5232: 
5233: We can now compare the above Transcendental Exposition of aesthetical
5234: judgements with the Physiological worked out by _Burke_ and by many
5235: clear-headed men among us, in order to see whither a merely empirical
5236: exposition of the Sublime and Beautiful leads. _Burke_, who deserves
5237: to be regarded as the most important author who adopts this mode of
5238: treatment, infers by this method “that the feeling of the Sublime
5239: rests on the impulse towards self-preservation and on _fear_, _i.e._
5240: on a pain, which not going so far as actually to derange the parts of
5241: the body, produces movements which, since they purify the finer or
5242: grosser vessels of dangerous or troublesome stoppages, are capable
5243: of exciting pleasant sensations; not indeed pleasure, but a kind of
5244: satisfying horror, a certain tranquillity tinged with terror.”[61] The
5245: Beautiful, which he founded on love (which he wishes to keep quite
5246: separate from desire), he reduces to “the relaxing, slackening, and
5247: enervating of the fibres of the body, and a consequent weakening,
5248: languor, and exhaustion, a fainting, dissolving, and melting away for
5249: enjoyment.”[62] And he confirms this explanation not only by cases in
5250: which the Imagination in combination with the Understanding can excite
5251: in us the feeling of the Beautiful or of the Sublime, but by cases in
5252: which it is combined with sensation.--As psychological observations,
5253: these analyses of the phenomena of our mind are exceedingly beautiful,
5254: and afford rich material for the favourite investigations of empirical
5255: anthropology. It is also not to be denied that all representations
5256: in us, whether, objectively viewed, they are merely sensible or are
5257: quite intellectual, may yet subjectively be united to gratification
5258: or grief, however imperceptible either may be; because they all
5259: affect the feeling of life, and none of them, so far as it is a
5260: modification of the subject, can be indifferent. And so, as Epicurus
5261: maintained, all _gratification_ or _grief_ may ultimately be corporeal,
5262: whether it arises from the representations of the Imagination or the
5263: Understanding; because life without a feeling of bodily organs would be
5264: merely a consciousness of existence, without any feeling of well-being
5265: or the reverse, _i.e._ of the furthering or the checking of the vital
5266: powers. For the mind is by itself alone life (the principle of life),
5267: and hindrances or furtherances must be sought outside it and yet in
5268: the man, consequently in union with his body.
5269: 
5270: If, however, we place the satisfaction in the object altogether in
5271: the fact that it gratifies us by charm or emotion, we must not assume
5272: that any _other_ man agrees with the aesthetical judgement which _we_
5273: pass; for as to these each one rightly consults his own individual
5274: sensibility. But in that case all censorship of taste would disappear,
5275: except indeed the example afforded by the accidental agreement of
5276: others in their judgements were regarded as _commanding_ our assent;
5277: and this principle we should probably resist, and should appeal to the
5278: natural right of subjecting the judgement, which rests on the immediate
5279: feeling of our own well-being, to our own sense and not to that of any
5280: other man.
5281: 
5282: If then the judgement of taste is not to be valid merely
5283: _egoistically_, but according to its inner nature,--_i.e._ on account
5284: of itself and not on account of the examples that others give of their
5285: taste,--to be necessarily valid _pluralistically_, if we regard it
5286: as a judgement which may exact the adhesion of every one; then there
5287: must lie at its basis some _a priori_ principle (whether objective or
5288: subjective) to which we can never attain by seeking out the empirical
5289: laws of mental changes. For these only enable us to know how we judge,
5290: but do not prescribe to us how we ought to judge. They do not supply an
5291: _unconditioned_ command,[63] such as judgements of taste presuppose,
5292: inasmuch as they require that the satisfaction be _immediately_
5293: connected with the representation. Thus the empirical exposition of
5294: aesthetical judgements may be a beginning of a collection of materials
5295: for a higher investigation; but a transcendental discussion of this
5296: faculty is also possible, and is an essential part of the Critique of
5297: Taste. For if it had not _a priori_ principles, it could not possibly
5298: pass sentence on the judgements of others, and it could not approve or
5299: blame them with any appearance of right.
5300: 
5301: The remaining part of the Analytic of the Aesthetical Judgement
5302: contains first the
5303: 
5304: 
5305: DEDUCTION OF [PURE[64]] AESTHETICAL JUDGEMENTS
5306: 
5307: § 30. _The Deduction of aesthetical judgements on the objects of nature
5308: must not be directed to what we call Sublime in nature, but only to the
5309: Beautiful._
5310: 
5311: The claim of an aesthetical judgement to universal validity for every
5312: subject requires, as a judgement resting on some _a priori_ principle,
5313: a Deduction (or legitimatising of its pretensions) in addition to its
5314: Exposition; if it is concerned with satisfaction or dissatisfaction
5315: in the _form of the Object_. Of this kind are judgements of taste
5316: about the Beautiful in Nature. For in that case the purposiveness
5317: has its ground in the Object and in its figure, although it does not
5318: indicate the reference of this to other objects according to concepts
5319: (for a cognitive judgement), but merely has to do in general with the
5320: apprehension of this form, so far as it shows itself conformable in the
5321: mind to the _faculty_ of concepts and to that of their presentation
5322: (which is identical with that of apprehension). We can thus, in respect
5323: of the Beautiful in nature, suggest many questions touching the cause
5324: of this purposiveness of their forms, _e.g._ to explain why nature has
5325: scattered abroad beauty with such profusion, even in the depth of the
5326: ocean, where the human eye (for which alone that purposiveness exists)
5327: but seldom penetrates.
5328: 
5329: But the Sublime in nature--if we are passing upon it a pure aesthetical
5330: judgement, not mixed up with any concepts of perfection or objective
5331: purposiveness, in which case it would be a teleological judgement--may
5332: be regarded as quite formless or devoid of figure, and yet as the
5333: object of a pure satisfaction; and it may display a subjective
5334: purposiveness in the given representation. And we ask if, for an
5335: aesthetical judgement of this kind,--over and above the Exposition
5336: of what is thought in it,--a Deduction also of its claim to any
5337: (subjective) _a priori_ principle may be demanded?
5338: 
5339: To which we may answer that the Sublime in nature is improperly so
5340: called, and that properly speaking the word should only be applied
5341: to a state of mind, or rather to its foundation in human nature. The
5342: apprehension of an otherwise formless and unpurposive object gives
5343: merely the occasion, through which we become conscious of such a state;
5344: the object is thus _employed_ as subjectively purposive, but is not
5345: judged as such _in itself_ and on account of its form (it is, as it
5346: were, a _species finalis accepta, non data_). Hence our Exposition of
5347: judgements concerning the Sublime in nature was at the same time their
5348: Deduction. For when we analysed the reflection of the Judgement in such
5349: acts, we found in them a purposive relation of the cognitive faculties,
5350: which must be ascribed ultimately to the faculty of purposes (the
5351: will), and hence is itself purposive _a priori_. This then immediately
5352: involves the Deduction, _i.e._ the justification of the claim of such a
5353: judgement to universal and necessary validity.
5354: 
5355: We shall therefore only have to seek for the deduction of judgements
5356: of Taste, _i.e._ of judgements about the Beauty of natural things;
5357: we shall thus treat satisfactorily the problem with which the whole
5358: faculty of aesthetical Judgement is concerned.

5363: A Deduction, _i.e._ the guarantee of the legitimacy of a class
5364: of judgements, is only obligatory if the judgement lays claim to
5365: necessity. This it does, if it demands even subjective universality or
5366: the agreement of every one, although it is not a judgement of cognition
5367: but only one of pleasure or pain in a given object; _i.e._ it assumes a
5368: subjective purposiveness thoroughly valid for every one, which must not
5369: be based on any concept of the thing, because the judgement is one of
5370: taste.
5371: 
5372: We have before us in the latter case no cognitive judgement--neither a
5373: theoretical one based on the concept of a _Nature_ in general formed
5374: by the Understanding, nor a (pure) practical one based on the Idea of
5375: _Freedom_, as given _a priori_ by Reason. Therefore we have to justify
5376: _a priori_ the validity neither of a judgement which represents what
5377: a thing is, nor of one which prescribes that I ought to do something
5378: in order to produce it. We have merely to prove for the Judgement
5379: generally the _universal validity_ of a singular judgement that
5380: expresses the subjective purposiveness of an empirical representation
5381: of the form of an object; in order to explain how it is possible that
5382: a thing can please in the mere act of judging it (without sensation or
5383: concept), and how the satisfaction of one man can be proclaimed as a
5384: rule for every other; just as the act of judging of an object for the
5385: sake of a _cognition_ in general has universal rules.
5386: 
5387: If now this universal validity is not to be based on any collecting of
5388: the suffrages of others, or on any questioning of them as to the kind
5389: of sensations they have, but is to rest, as it were, on an autonomy of
5390: the judging subject in respect of the feeling of pleasure (in the given
5391: representation), _i.e._ on his own taste, and yet is not to be derived
5392: from concepts; then a judgement like this--such as the judgement of
5393: taste is, in fact--has a twofold logical peculiarity. _First_, there is
5394: its _a priori_ universal validity, which is not a logical universality
5395: in accordance with concepts, but the universality of a singular
5396: judgement. _Secondly_, it has a necessity (which must always rest on
5397: _a priori_ grounds), which however does not depend on any _a priori_
5398: grounds of proof, through the representation of which the assent that
5399: every one concedes to the judgement of taste could be exacted.
5400: 
5401: The solution of these logical peculiarities, wherein a judgement
5402: of taste is different from all cognitive judgements--if we at the
5403: outset abstract from all content, viz. from the feeling of pleasure,
5404: and merely compare the aesthetical form with the form of objective
5405: judgements as logic prescribes it--is sufficient by itself for the
5406: deduction of this singular faculty. We shall then represent and
5407: elucidate by examples these characteristic properties of taste.
5408: 
5409: 
5410: § 32. _First peculiarity of the judgement of Taste_
5411: 
5412: The judgement of taste determines its object in respect of satisfaction
5413: (in its beauty) with an accompanying claim for the assent of _every
5414: one_, just as if it were objective.
5415: 
5416: To say that “this flower is beautiful” is the same as to assert its
5417: proper claim to satisfy every one. By the pleasantness of its smell
5418: it has no such claim. A smell which one man enjoys gives another a
5419: headache. Now what are we to presume from this except that beauty is
5420: to be regarded as a property of the flower itself, which does not
5421: accommodate itself to any diversity of persons or of their sensitive
5422: organs, but to which these must accommodate themselves if they are to
5423: pass any judgement upon it? And yet this is not so. For a judgement
5424: of taste consists in calling a thing beautiful just because of that
5425: characteristic in respect of which it accommodates itself to our mode
5426: of apprehension.
5427: 
5428: Moreover, it is required of every judgement which is to prove the
5429: taste of the subject, that the subject shall judge by himself, without
5430: needing to grope about empirically among the judgements of others, and
5431: acquaint himself previously as to their satisfaction or dissatisfaction
5432: with the same object; thus his judgement should be pronounced _a
5433: priori_, and not be a mere imitation because the thing actually gives
5434: universal pleasure. One would think, however, that an _a priori_
5435: judgement must contain a concept of the Object, for the cognition of
5436: which it contains the principle; but the judgement of taste is not
5437: based upon concepts at all, and is in general not a cognitive but an
5438: aesthetical judgement.
5439: 
5440: Thus a young poet does not permit himself to be dissuaded from his
5441: conviction that his poem is beautiful, by the judgement of the public
5442: or of his friends; and if he gives ear to them he does so, not because
5443: he now judges differently, but because, although (in regard to him)
5444: the whole public has false taste, in his desire for applause he finds
5445: reason for accommodating himself to the common error (even against his
5446: judgement). It is only at a later time, when his Judgement has been
5447: sharpened by exercise, that he voluntarily departs from his former
5448: judgements; just as he proceeds with those of his judgements which rest
5449: upon Reason. Taste [merely][65] claims autonomy. To make the judgements
5450: of others the determining grounds of his own would be heteronomy.
5451: 
5452: That we, and rightly, recommend the works of the ancients as models
5453: and call their authors classical, thus forming among writers a kind
5454: of noble class who give laws to the people by their example, seems
5455: to indicate _a posteriori_ sources of taste, and to contradict the
5456: autonomy of taste in every subject. But we might just as well say
5457: that the old mathematicians,--who are regarded up to the present day
5458: as supplying models not easily to be dispensed with for the supreme
5459: profundity and elegance of their synthetical methods,--prove that our
5460: Reason is only imitative, and that we have not the faculty of producing
5461: from it in combination with intuition rigid proofs by means of the
5462: construction of concepts.[66] There is no use of our powers, however
5463: free, no use of Reason itself (which must create all its judgements
5464: _a priori_ from common sources) which would not give rise to faulty
5465: attempts, if every subject had always to begin anew from the rude basis
5466: of his natural state, and if others had not preceded him with their
5467: attempts. Not that these make mere imitators of those who come after
5468: them, but rather by their procedure they put others on the track of
5469: seeking in themselves principles and so of pursuing their own course,
5470: often a better one. Even in religion--where certainly every one has
5471: to derive the rule of his conduct from himself, because he remains
5472: responsible for it and cannot shift the blame of his transgressions
5473: upon others, whether his teachers or his predecessors--there is never
5474: as much accomplished by means of universal precepts, either obtained
5475: from priests or philosophers or got from oneself, as by means of
5476: an example of virtue or holiness which, exhibited in history, does
5477: not dispense with the autonomy of virtue based on the proper and
5478: original Idea of morality (_a priori_), or change it into a mechanical
5479: imitation. _Following_, involving something precedent, not “imitation,”
5480: is the right expression for all influence that the products of an
5481: exemplary author may have upon others. And this only means that we
5482: draw from the same sources as our predecessor did, and learn from him
5483: only the way to avail ourselves of them. But of all faculties and
5484: talents Taste, because its judgement is not determinable by concepts
5485: and precepts, is just that one which most needs examples of what has
5486: in the progress of culture received the longest approval; that it may
5487: not become again uncivilised and return to the crudeness of its first
5488: essays.
5489: 
5490: 
5491: § 33. _Second peculiarity of the judgement of Taste_
5492: 
5493: The judgement of taste is not determinable by grounds of proof, just as
5494: if it were merely _subjective_.
5495: 
5496: If a man, _in the first place_, does not find a building, a prospect,
5497: or a poem beautiful, a hundred voices all highly praising it will not
5498: force his inmost agreement. He may indeed feign that it pleases him in
5499: order that he may not be regarded as devoid of taste; he may even begin
5500: to doubt whether he has formed his taste on a knowledge of a sufficient
5501: number of objects of a certain kind (just as one, who believes that
5502: he recognises in the distance as a forest, something which all others
5503: regard as a town, doubts the judgement of his own sight). But he
5504: clearly sees that the agreement of others gives no valid proof of the
5505: judgement about beauty. Others might perhaps see and observe for him;
5506: and what many have seen in one way, although he believes that he has
5507: seen it differently, might serve him as an adequate ground of proof
5508: of a theoretical and consequently logical judgement. But that a thing
5509: has pleased others could never serve as the basis of an aesthetical
5510: judgement. A judgement of others which is unfavourable to ours may
5511: indeed rightly make us scrutinise our own with care, but it can never
5512: convince us of its incorrectness. There is therefore no empirical
5513: _ground of proof_ which would force a judgement of taste upon any one.
5514: 
5515: Still less, _in the second place_, can an _a priori_ proof determine
5516: according to definite rules a judgement about beauty. If a man reads
5517: me a poem of his or brings me to a play, which does not after all suit
5518: my taste, he may bring forward in proof of the beauty of his poem
5519: _Batteux_[67] or _Lessing_ or still more ancient and famous critics
5520: of taste, and all the rules laid down by them; certain passages which
5521: displease me may agree very well with rules of beauty (as they have
5522: been put forth by these writers and are universally recognised): but
5523: I stop my ears, I will listen to no arguments and no reasoning; and I
5524: will rather assume that these rules of the critics are false, or at
5525: least that they do not apply to the case in question, than admit that
5526: my judgement should be determined by grounds of proof _a priori_. For
5527: it is to be a judgement of Taste and not of Understanding or Reason.
5528: 
5529: It seems that this is one of the chief reasons why this aesthetical
5530: faculty of judgement has been given the name of Taste. For though a
5531: man enumerate to me all the ingredients of a dish, and remark that
5532: each is separately pleasant to me and further extol with justice the
5533: wholesomeness of this particular food--yet am I deaf to all these
5534: reasons; I try the dish with _my_ tongue and my palate, and thereafter
5535: (and not according to universal principles) do I pass my judgement.
5536: 
5537: In fact the judgement of Taste always takes the form of a singular
5538: judgement about an Object. The Understanding can form a universal
5539: judgement by comparing the Object in point of the satisfaction it
5540: affords with the judgement of others upon it: _e.g._ “all tulips are
5541: beautiful.” But then this is not a judgement of taste but a logical
5542: judgement, which takes the relation of an Object to taste as the
5543: predicate of things of a certain species. That judgement, however, in
5544: which I find an individual given tulip beautiful, _i.e._ in which
5545: I find my satisfaction in it to be universally valid, is alone a
5546: judgement of taste. Its peculiarity consists in the fact that, although
5547: it has merely subjective validity, it claims the assent of _all_
5548: subjects, exactly as it would do if it were an objective judgement
5549: resting on grounds of knowledge, that could be established by a proof.
5550: 
5551: 
5552: § 34. _There is no objective principle of Taste possible_
5553: 
5554: By a principle of taste I mean a principle under the condition of
5555: which we could subsume the concept of an object and thus infer by
5556: means of a syllogism that the object is beautiful. But that is
5557: absolutely impossible. For I must feel the pleasure immediately in the
5558: representation of the object, and of that I can be persuaded by no
5559: grounds of proof whatever. Although, as _Hume_ says,[68] all critics
5560: can reason more plausibly than cooks, yet the same fate awaits them.
5561: They cannot expect the determining ground of their judgement [to be
5562: derived] from the force of the proofs, but only from the reflection
5563: of the subject upon its own proper state (of pleasure or pain), all
5564: precepts and rules being rejected.
5565: 
5566: But although critics can and ought to pursue their reasonings so that
5567: our judgements of taste may be corrected and extended, it is not with
5568: a view to set forth the determining ground of this kind of aesthetical
5569: judgements in a universally applicable formula, which is impossible;
5570: but rather to investigate the cognitive faculties and their exercise in
5571: these judgements, and to explain by examples the reciprocal subjective
5572: purposiveness, the form of which, as has been shown above, in a given
5573: representation, constitutes the beauty of the object. Therefore the
5574: Critique of Taste is only subjective as regards the representation
5575: through which an Object is given to us; viz. it is the art or science
5576: of reducing to rules the reciprocal relation between the Understanding
5577: and the Imagination in the given representation (without reference
5578: to any preceding sensation or concept). That is, it is the art or
5579: science of reducing to rules their accordance or discordance, and of
5580: determining them with regard to their conditions. It is an _art_, if
5581: it only shows this by examples; it is a _science_ if it derives the
5582: possibility of such judgements from the nature of these faculties,
5583: as cognitive faculties in general. We have here, in Transcendental
5584: Criticism, only to do with the latter. It should develop and justify
5585: the subjective principle of taste, as an _a priori_ principle of
5586: the Judgement. This Critique, as an art, merely seeks to apply, in
5587: the judging of objects, the physiological (here psychological), and
5588: therefore empirical rules, according to which taste actually proceeds
5589: (without taking any account of their possibility); and it criticises
5590: the products of beautiful art just as, regarded as a science, it
5591: criticises the faculty by which they are judged.
5592: 
5593: 
5594: § 35. _The principle of Taste is the subjective principle of Judgement
5595: in general_
5596: 
5597: The judgement of taste is distinguished from a logical judgement in
5598: this, that the latter subsumes a representation under the concept
5599: of the Object, while the former does not subsume it under any
5600: concept; because otherwise the necessary universal agreement [in
5601: these judgements] would be capable of being enforced by proofs.
5602: Nevertheless it is like the latter in this, that it claims universality
5603: and necessity, though not according to concepts of the Object, and
5604: consequently a merely subjective necessity. Now, because the concepts
5605: in a judgement constitute its content (what belongs to the cognition
5606: of the Object), but the judgement of taste is not determinable by
5607: concepts, it is based only on the subjective formal condition of a
5608: judgement in general. The subjective condition of all judgements is
5609: the faculty of Judgement itself. This when used with reference to a
5610: representation by which an object is given, requires the accordance
5611: of two representative powers: viz. Imagination (for the intuition and
5612: comprehension of the manifold) and Understanding (for the concept as
5613: a representation of the unity of this comprehension). Now because no
5614: concept of the Object lies here at the basis of the judgement, it can
5615: only consist in the subsumption of the Imagination itself (in the case
5616: of a representation by which an object is given) under the conditions
5617: that the Understanding requires to pass from intuition to concepts.
5618: That is, because the freedom of the Imagination consists in the fact
5619: that it schematises without any concept, the judgement of taste must
5620: rest on a mere sensation of the reciprocal activity of the Imagination
5621: in its _freedom_ and the Understanding with its _conformity to law_.
5622: It must therefore rest on a feeling, which makes us judge the object
5623: by the purposiveness of the representation (by which an object is
5624: given) in respect of the furtherance of the cognitive faculty in its
5625: free play. Taste, then, as subjective Judgement, contains a principle
5626: of subsumption, not of intuitions under concepts, but of the _faculty_
5627: of intuitions or presentations (_i.e._ the Imagination) under the
5628: _faculty_ of the concepts (_i.e._ the Understanding); so far as the
5629: former _in its freedom_ harmonises with the latter _in its conformity
5630: to law_.
5631: 
5632: In order to discover this ground of legitimacy by a Deduction of the
5633: judgements of taste we can only take as a clue the formal peculiarities
5634: of this kind of judgements, and consequently can only consider their
5635: logical form.
5636: 
5637: 
5638: § 36. _Of the problem of a Deduction of judgements of Taste_
5639: 
5640: The concept of an Object in general can immediately be combined with
5641: the perception of an object, containing its empirical predicates, so
5642: as to form a cognitive judgement; and it is thus that a judgement
5643: of experience is produced.[69] At the basis of this lie _a priori_
5644: concepts of the synthetical unity of the manifold of intuition, by
5645: which the manifold is thought as the determination of an Object. These
5646: concepts (the Categories) require a Deduction, which is given in the
5647: Critique of pure Reason; and by it we can get the solution of the
5648: problem, how are synthetical _a priori_ cognitive judgements possible?
5649: This problem concerns then the _a priori_ principles of the pure
5650: Understanding and its theoretical judgements.
5651: 
5652: But with a perception there can also be combined a feeling of pleasure
5653: (or pain) and a satisfaction, that accompanies the representation
5654: of the Object and serves instead of its predicate; thus there can
5655: result an aesthetical non-cognitive judgement. At the basis of
5656: such a judgement--if it is not a mere judgement of sensation but a
5657: formal judgement of reflection, which imputes the same satisfaction
5658: necessarily to every one,--must lie some _a priori_ principle; which
5659: may be merely subjective (if an objective one should prove impossible
5660: for judgements of this kind), but also as such may need a Deduction,
5661: that we may thereby comprehend how an aesthetical judgement can lay
5662: claim to necessity. On this is founded the problem with which we are
5663: now occupied, how are judgements of taste possible? This problem
5664: then has to do with the _a priori_ principles of the pure faculty of
5665: Judgement in _aesthetical_ judgements; _i.e._ judgements in which it
5666: has not (as in theoretical ones) merely to subsume under objective
5667: concepts of Understanding, and in which it is subject to a law, but in
5668: which it is, itself, subjectively, both object and law.
5669: 
5670: This problem then may be thus represented: how is a judgement possible,
5671: in which merely from _our own_ feeling of pleasure in an object,
5672: independently of its concept, we judge that this pleasure attaches to
5673: the representation of the same Object _in every other subject_, and
5674: that _a priori_ without waiting for the accordance of others?
5675: 
5676: It is easy to see that judgements of taste are synthetical, because
5677: they go beyond the concept and even beyond the intuition of the
5678: Object, and add to that intuition as predicate something that is not a
5679: cognition, viz. a feeling of pleasure (or pain). Although the predicate
5680: (of the _personal_ pleasure bound up with the representation) is
5681: empirical, nevertheless, as concerns the required assent of _every one_
5682: the judgements are _a priori_, or desire to be regarded as such; and
5683: this is already involved in the expressions of this claim. Thus this
5684: problem of the Critique of Judgement belongs to the general problem of
5685: transcendental philosophy, how are synthetical _a priori_ judgements
5686: possible?
5687: 
5688: 
5689: § 37. _What is properly asserted a priori of an object in a judgement
5690: of Taste_
5691: 
5692: That the representation of an object is immediately bound up with
5693: pleasure can only be internally perceived, and if we did not wish to
5694: indicate anything more than this it would give a merely empirical
5695: judgement. For I cannot combine a definite feeling (of pleasure or
5696: pain) with any representation except where there is at bottom an _a
5697: priori_ principle in the Reason determining the Will. In that case the
5698: pleasure (in the moral feeling) is the consequence of the principle,
5699: but cannot be compared with the pleasure in taste, because it requires
5700: a definite concept of a law; and the latter pleasure, on the contrary,
5701: must be bound up with the mere act of judging, prior to all concepts.
5702: Hence also all judgements of taste are singular judgements, because
5703: they do not combine their predicate of satisfaction with a concept,
5704: but with a given individual empirical representation.
5705: 
5706: And so it is not the pleasure, but the _universal validity of this
5707: pleasure_, perceived as mentally bound up with the mere judgement upon
5708: an object, which is represented _a priori_ in a judgement of taste as
5709: a universal rule for the Judgement and valid for every one. It is an
5710: empirical judgement [to say] that I perceive and judge an object with
5711: pleasure. But it is an _a priori_ judgement [to say] that I find it
5712: beautiful, _i.e._ I attribute this satisfaction necessarily to every
5713: one.
5714: 
5715: 
5716: § 38. _Deduction of judgements of Taste_
5717: 
5718: If it be admitted that in a pure judgement of taste the satisfaction
5719: in the object is combined with the mere act of judging its form, it is
5720: nothing else than its subjective purposiveness for the Judgement which
5721: we feel to be mentally combined with the representation of the object.
5722: The Judgement, as regards the formal rules of its action, apart from
5723: all matter (whether sensation or concept), can only be directed to the
5724: subjective conditions of its employment in general (it is applied[70]
5725: neither to a particular mode of sense nor to a particular concept of
5726: the Understanding); and consequently to that subjective [element] which
5727: we can presuppose in all men (as requisite for possible cognition in
5728: general). Thus the agreement of a representation with these conditions
5729: of the Judgement must be capable of being assumed as valid _a priori_
5730: for every one. _I.e._ we may rightly impute to every one the pleasure
5731: or the subjective purposiveness of the representation for the relation
5732: between the cognitive faculties in the act of judging a sensible object
5733: in general.[71]
5734: 
5735: 
5736: _Remark_
5737: 
5738: This Deduction is thus easy, because it has no need to justify the
5739: objective reality of any concept, for Beauty is not a concept of the
5740: Object and the judgement of taste is not cognitive. It only maintains
5741: that we are justified in presupposing universally in every man those
5742: subjective conditions of the Judgement which we find in ourselves; and
5743: further, that we have rightly subsumed the given Object under these
5744: conditions. The latter has indeed unavoidable difficulties which do
5745: not beset the logical Judgement. There we subsume under concepts,
5746: but in the aesthetical Judgement under a merely sensible relation
5747: between the Imagination and Understanding mutually harmonising in
5748: the representation of the form of the Object,--in which case the
5749: subsumption may easily be fallacious. Yet the legitimacy of the
5750: claim of the Judgement in counting upon universal assent is not thus
5751: annulled; it reduces itself merely to the correctness of the principle
5752: of judging validly for every one from subjective grounds. For as to
5753: the difficulty or doubt concerning the correctness of the subsumption
5754: under that principle, it makes the legitimacy of the claim of an
5755: aesthetical judgement in general to such validity and the principle
5756: of the same, as little doubtful, as the like faulty (though neither
5757: so commonly nor readily faulty) subsumption of the logical Judgement
5758: under its principle can make the latter, an objective principle,
5759: doubtful. But if the question were to be, how is it possible to assume
5760: nature _a priori_ to be a complex of objects of taste? this problem
5761: has reference to Teleology, because it must be regarded as a purpose
5762: of nature essentially belonging to its concept to exhibit forms that
5763: are purposive for our Judgement. But the correctness of this latter
5764: assumption is very doubtful, whereas the efficacy of natural beauties
5765: is patent to experience.
5766: 
5767: 
5768: § 39. _Of the communicability of a Sensation_
5769: 
5770: If sensation, as the real in perception, is related to knowledge, it
5771: is called sensation of the senses; and its specific quality may be
5772: represented as generally communicable in a uniform way, if we assume
5773: that every one has senses like our own. But this cannot at all be
5774: presupposed of any single sensation. To a man who is deficient in the
5775: sense of smell, this kind of sensation cannot be communicated; and
5776: even if it is not wholly deficient, we cannot be certain that he gets
5777: exactly the same sensation from a flower that we have. But even more
5778: must we represent men as differing in respect of the _pleasantness_
5779: or _unpleasantness_ involved in the sensation from the same object of
5780: sense; and it is absolutely not to be required that every man should
5781: take pleasure in the same objects. Pleasure of this kind, because it
5782: comes into the mind through the senses, in respect of which therefore
5783: we are passive, we may call the pleasure of _enjoyment_.
5784: 
5785: Satisfaction in an action because of its moral character is on the
5786: other hand not the pleasure of enjoyment, but of spontaneity and its
5787: accordance with the Idea of its destination. But this feeling, called
5788: moral, requires concepts, and presents not free purposiveness, but
5789: purposiveness that is conformable to law; it therefore admits of being
5790: universally communicated only by means of Reason, and, if the pleasure
5791: is to be homogeneous for every one, by very definite practical concepts
5792: of Reason.
5793: 
5794: Pleasure in the Sublime in nature, regarded as a pleasure of rational
5795: contemplation, also makes claim to universal participation; but
5796: it presupposes, besides, a different feeling, viz. that of our
5797: supersensible destination, which, however obscurely, has a moral
5798: foundation. But that other men will take account of it, and will find
5799: a satisfaction in the consideration of the wild greatness of nature
5800: (that certainly cannot be ascribed to its aspect, which is rather
5801: terrifying), I am not absolutely justified in supposing. Nevertheless,
5802: in consideration of the fact that on every suitable occasion regard
5803: should be had to these moral dispositions, I can impute such
5804: satisfaction to every man, but only by means of the moral law which on
5805: its side again is based on concepts of Reason.
5806: 
5807: On the contrary, pleasure in the Beautiful is neither a pleasure
5808: of enjoyment nor of a law-abiding activity, nor even of rational
5809: contemplation in accordance with Ideas, but of mere reflection. Without
5810: having as rule any purpose or fundamental proposition, this pleasure
5811: accompanies the ordinary apprehension of an object by the Imagination,
5812: as faculty of intuition, in relation with the Understanding, as faculty
5813: of concepts, by means of a procedure of the Judgement which it must
5814: also exercise on behalf of the commonest experience; only that in
5815: the latter case it is in order to perceive an empirical objective
5816: concept, in the former case (in aesthetical judgements) merely to
5817: perceive the accordance of the representation with the harmonious
5818: (subjectively purposive) activity of both cognitive faculties in their
5819: freedom, _i.e._ to feel with pleasure the mental state produced by
5820: the representation. This pleasure must necessarily depend for every
5821: one on the same conditions, for they are subjective conditions of the
5822: possibility of a cognition in general; and the proportion between
5823: these cognitive faculties requisite for Taste is also requisite for
5824: that ordinary sound Understanding which we have to presuppose in
5825: every one. Therefore he who judges with taste (if only he does not go
5826: astray in this act of consciousness and mistake matter for form or
5827: charm for beauty) may impute to every one subjective purposiveness,
5828: _i.e._ his satisfaction in the Object, and may assume his feeling to be
5829: universally communicable and that without the mediation of concepts.
5830: 
5831: 
5832: § 40. _Of Taste as a kind of_ sensus communis
5833: 
5834: We often give to the Judgement, if we are considering the result rather
5835: than the act of its reflection, the name of a sense, and we speak of
5836: a sense of truth, or of a sense of decorum, of justice, etc. And yet
5837: we know, or at least we ought to know, that these concepts cannot
5838: have their place in Sense, and further, that Sense has not the least
5839: capacity for expressing universal rules; but that no representation
5840: of truth, fitness, beauty, or justice, and so forth, could come into
5841: our thoughts if we could not rise beyond Sense to higher faculties
5842: of cognition. _The common Understanding of men_, which, as the mere
5843: sound (not yet cultivated) Understanding, we regard as the least to
5844: be expected from any one claiming the name of man, has therefore the
5845: doubtful honour of being given the name of common sense (_sensus
5846: communis_); and in such a way that by the name _common_ (not merely
5847: in our language, where the word actually has a double signification,
5848: but in many others) we understand _vulgar_, that which is everywhere
5849: met with, the possession of which indicates absolutely no merit or
5850: superiority.
5851: 
5852: But under the _sensus communis_ we must include the Idea of a
5853: _communal_ sense, _i.e._ of a faculty of judgement, which in its
5854: reflection takes account (_a priori_) of the mode of representation
5855: of all other men in thought; in order _as it were_ to compare its
5856: judgement with the collective Reason of humanity, and thus to escape
5857: the illusion arising from the private conditions that could be so
5858: easily taken for objective, which would injuriously affect the
5859: judgement. This is done by comparing our judgement with the possible
5860: rather than the actual judgements of others, and by putting ourselves
5861: in the place of any other man, by abstracting from the limitations
5862: which contingently attach to our own judgement. This, again, is
5863: brought about by leaving aside as much as possible the matter of our
5864: representative state, _i.e._ sensation, and simply having respect to
5865: the formal peculiarities of our representation or representative state.
5866: Now this operation of reflection seems perhaps too artificial to be
5867: attributed to the faculty called _common_ sense; but it only appears
5868: so, when expressed in abstract formulae. In itself there is nothing
5869: more natural than to abstract from charm or emotion if we are seeking a
5870: judgement that is to serve as a universal rule.
5871: 
5872: The following Maxims of common human Understanding do not properly
5873: come in here, as parts of the Critique of Taste; but yet they may
5874: serve to elucidate its fundamental propositions. They are: 1° to
5875: think for oneself; 2° to put ourselves in thought in the place of
5876: every one else; 3° always to think consistently. The first is the
5877: maxim of _unprejudiced_ thought; the second of _enlarged_ thought;
5878: the third of _consecutive_ thought.[72] The first is the maxim of a
5879: Reason never _passive_. The tendency to such passivity, and therefore
5880: to heteronomy of the Reason, is called _prejudice_; and the greatest
5881: prejudice of all is to represent nature as not subject to the rules
5882: that the Understanding places at its basis by means of its own
5883: essential law, _i.e._ is _superstition_. Deliverance from superstition
5884: is called _enlightenment_;[73] because although this name belongs to
5885: deliverance from prejudices in general, yet superstition specially
5886: (_in sensu eminenti_) deserves to be called a prejudice. For the
5887: blindness in which superstition places us, which it even imposes on
5888: us as an obligation, makes the need of being guided by others, and
5889: the consequent passive state of our Reason, peculiarly noticeable. As
5890: regards the second maxim of the mind, we are otherwise wont to call
5891: him limited (_borné_, the opposite of _enlarged_) whose talents attain
5892: to no great use (especially as regards intensity). But here we are not
5893: speaking of the faculty of cognition, but of the _mode of thought_
5894: which makes a purposive use thereof. However small may be the area
5895: or the degree to which a man’s natural gifts reach, yet it indicates
5896: a man of _enlarged thought_ if he disregards the subjective private
5897: conditions of his own judgement, by which so many others are confined,
5898: and reflects upon it from a _universal standpoint_ (which he can only
5899: determine by placing himself at the standpoint of others). The third
5900: maxim, viz. that of _consecutive_ thought, is the most difficult to
5901: attain, and can only be attained by the combination of both the former,
5902: and after the constant observance of them has grown into a habit. We
5903: may say that the first of these maxims is the maxim of Understanding,
5904: the second of Judgement, and the third of Reason.
5905: 
5906: I take up again the threads interrupted by this digression, and I say
5907: that Taste can be called _sensus communis_ with more justice than sound
5908: Understanding can; and that the aesthetical Judgement rather than the
5909: intellectual may bear the name of a communal sense,[74] if we are
5910: willing to use the word “sense” of an effect of mere reflection upon
5911: the mind: for then we understand by sense the feeling of pleasure. We
5912: could even define Taste as the faculty of judging of that which makes
5913: _universally communicable_, without the mediation of a concept, our
5914: feeling in a given representation.
5915: 
5916: The skill that men have in communicating their thoughts requires also
5917: a relation between the Imagination and the Understanding in order to
5918: associate intuitions with concepts, and concepts again with those
5919: concepts, which then combine in a cognition. But in that case the
5920: agreement of the two mental powers is _according to law_, under the
5921: constraint of definite concepts. Only where the Imagination in its
5922: freedom awakens the Understanding, and is put by it into regular play
5923: without the aid of concepts, does the representation communicate itself
5924: not as a thought but as an internal feeling of a purposive state of the
5925: mind.
5926: 
5927: Taste is then the faculty of judging _a priori_ of the communicability
5928: of feelings that are bound up with a given representation (without the
5929: mediation of a concept).
5930: 
5931: If we could assume that the mere universal communicability of a feeling
5932: must carry in itself an interest for us with it (which, however, we are
5933: not justified in concluding from the character of a merely reflective
5934: Judgement), we should be able to explain why the feeling in the
5935: judgement of taste comes to be imputed to every one, so to speak, as a
5936: duty.
5937: 
5938: 
5939: § 41. _Of the empirical interest in the Beautiful_
5940: 
5941: That the judgement of taste by which something is declared beautiful
5942: must have no interest _as its determining ground_ has been sufficiently
5943: established above. But it does not follow that after it has been
5944: given as a pure aesthetical judgement, no interest can be combined
5945: with it. This combination, however, can only be indirect, _i.e._ taste
5946: must first of all be represented as combined with something else, in
5947: order that we may unite with the satisfaction of mere reflection upon
5948: an object a _pleasure in its existence_ (as that wherein all interest
5949: consists). For here also in aesthetical judgements what we say in
5950: cognitive judgements (of things in general) is valid; _a posse ad esse
5951: non valet consequentia_. This something else may be empirical, viz. an
5952: inclination proper to human nature, or intellectual, as the property
5953: of the Will of being capable of _a priori_ determination by Reason.
5954: Both these involve a satisfaction in the presence of an Object, and so
5955: can lay the foundation for an interest in what has by itself pleased
5956: without reference to any interest whatever.
5957: 
5958: Empirically the Beautiful interests only in _society_. If we admit
5959: the impulse to society as natural to man, and his fitness for it, and
5960: his propension towards it, _i.e._ _sociability_, as a requisite for
5961: man as a being destined for society, and so as a property belonging
5962: to _humanity_, we cannot escape from regarding taste as a faculty for
5963: judging everything in respect of which we can communicate our _feeling_
5964: to all other men, and so as a means of furthering that which every
5965: one’s natural inclination desires.
5966: 
5967: A man abandoned by himself on a desert island would adorn neither his
5968: hut nor his person; nor would he seek for flowers, still less would he
5969: plant them, in order to adorn himself therewith. It is only in society
5970: that it occurs to him to be not merely a man, but a refined man after
5971: his kind (the beginning of civilisation). For such do we judge him to
5972: be who is both inclined and apt to communicate his pleasure to others,
5973: and who is not contented with an Object if he cannot feel satisfaction
5974: in it in common with others. Again, every one expects and requires from
5975: every one else this reference to universal communication [of pleasure],
5976: as it were from an original compact dictated by humanity itself. Thus,
5977: doubtless, in the beginning only those things which attracted the
5978: senses, _e.g._ colours for painting oneself (roucou among the Carabs
5979: and cinnabar among the Iroquois), flowers, mussel shells, beautiful
5980: feathers, etc.,--but in time beautiful forms also (_e.g._ in their
5981: canoes, and clothes, etc.), which bring with them no gratification, or
5982: satisfaction of enjoyment--were important in society, and were combined
5983: with great interest. Until at last civilisation, having reached its
5984: highest point, makes out of this almost the main business of refined
5985: inclination; and sensations are only regarded as of worth in so far as
5986: they can be universally communicated. Here, although the pleasure which
5987: every one has in such an object is inconsiderable and in itself without
5988: any marked interest, yet the Idea of its universal communicability
5989: increases its worth in an almost infinite degree.
5990: 
5991: But this interest that indirectly attaches to the Beautiful through
5992: our inclination to society, and consequently is empirical, is of no
5993: importance for us here; because we have only to look to what may have
5994: a reference, although only indirectly, to the judgement of taste _a
5995: priori_. For if even in this form an interest bound up therewith should
5996: discover itself, taste would discover a transition of our judging
5997: faculty from sense-enjoyment to moral feeling; and so not only would
5998: we be the better guided in employing taste purposively, but there
5999: would be thus presented a link in the chain of the human faculties _a
6000: priori_, on which all legislation must depend. We can only say thus
6001: much about the empirical interest in objects of taste and in taste
6002: itself. Since it is subservient to inclination, however refined the
6003: latter may be, it may easily be confounded with all the inclinations
6004: and passions, which attain their greatest variety and highest degree in
6005: society; and the interest in the Beautiful, if it is grounded thereon,
6006: can only furnish a very ambiguous transition from the Pleasant to the
6007: Good. But whether this can or cannot be furthered by taste, taken in
6008: its purity, is what we now have to investigate.
6009: 
6010: 
6011: § 42. _Of the intellectual interest in the Beautiful_
6012: 
6013: With the best intentions those persons who refer all activities, to
6014: which their inner natural dispositions impel men, to the final purpose
6015: of humanity, viz. the morally good, have regarded the taking an
6016: interest in the Beautiful in general as a mark of good moral character.
6017: But it is not without reason that they have been contradicted by others
6018: who rely on experience; for this shows that connoisseurs in taste,
6019: not only often but generally, are given up to idle, capricious, and
6020: mischievous passions, and that they could perhaps make less claim than
6021: others to any pre-eminent attachment to moral principles. Thus it would
6022: seem that the feeling for the Beautiful is not only (as actually is
6023: the case) specifically different from the Moral feeling; but that the
6024: interest which can be bound up with it is hardly compatible with moral
6025: interest, and certainly has no inner affinity therewith.
6026: 
6027: Now I admit at once that the interest in the _Beautiful of Art_ (under
6028: which I include the artificial use of natural beauties for adornment
6029: and so for vanity) furnishes no proof whatever of a disposition
6030: attached to the morally good or even inclined thereto. But on the
6031: other hand, I maintain that to take an _immediate interest_ in the
6032: Beauty of Nature (not merely to have taste in judging it) is always
6033: a mark of a good soul; and that when this interest is habitual it at
6034: least indicates a frame of mind favourable to the moral feeling, if it
6035: is voluntarily bound up with the _contemplation of nature_. It is to
6036: be remembered, however, that I here speak strictly of the beautiful
6037: _forms_ of Nature, and I set aside the _charms_, that she is wont to
6038: combine so abundantly with them; because, though the interest in the
6039: latter is indeed immediate, it is only empirical.
6040: 
6041: He who by himself (and without any design of communicating his
6042: observations to others) regards the beautiful figure of a wild flower,
6043: a bird, an insect, etc., with admiration and love--who would not
6044: willingly miss it in Nature, although it may bring him some hurt, who
6045: still less wants any advantage from it--_he_ takes an immediate and
6046: also an intellectual interest in the beauty of Nature. _I.e._ it is not
6047: merely the form of the product of nature which pleases him, but its
6048: very presence pleases him, the charms of sense having no share in this
6049: pleasure and no purpose whatever being combined with it.
6050: 
6051: But it is noteworthy that if we secretly deceived this lover of the
6052: beautiful by planting in the ground artificial flowers (which can be
6053: manufactured exactly like natural ones), or by placing artificially
6054: carved birds on the boughs of trees, and he discovered the deceit, the
6055: immediate interest that he previously took in them would disappear
6056: at once; though, perhaps, a different interest, viz. the interest of
6057: vanity in adorning his chamber with them for the eyes of others, would
6058: take its place. This thought then must accompany our intuition and
6059: reflection on beauty, viz. that nature has produced it; and on this
6060: alone is based the immediate interest that we take in it. Otherwise,
6061: there remains a mere judgement of taste, either devoid of all interest,
6062: or bound up with a mediate interest, viz. in that it has reference to
6063: society; which latter [interest] furnishes no certain indications of a
6064: morally good disposition.
6065: 
6066: This superiority of natural to artificial beauty in that it alone
6067: arouses an immediate interest, although as regards form the first
6068: may be surpassed by the second, harmonises with the refined and
6069: well-grounded habit of thought of all men who have cultivated their
6070: moral feeling. If a man who has taste enough to judge of the products
6071: of beautiful Art with the greatest accuracy and refinement willingly
6072: leaves a chamber where are to be found those beauties that minister to
6073: vanity or to any social joys, and turns to the beautiful in Nature in
6074: order to find, as it were, delight for his spirit in a train of thought
6075: that he can never completely evolve, we will regard this choice of his
6076: with veneration, and attribute to him a beautiful soul, to which no
6077: connoisseur or lover [of Art] can lay claim on account of the interest
6078: he takes in his [artistic] objects.--What now is the difference in
6079: our estimation of these two different kinds of Objects, which in the
6080: judgement of mere taste it is hard to compare in point of superiority?
6081: 
6082: We have a faculty of mere aesthetical Judgement by which we judge forms
6083: without the aid of concepts, and find a satisfaction in this mere act
6084: of judgement; this we make into a rule for every one, without this
6085: judgement either being based on or producing any interest.--On the
6086: other hand, we have also a faculty of intellectual Judgement which
6087: determines an _a priori_ satisfaction for the mere forms of practical
6088: maxims (so far as they are in themselves qualified for universal
6089: legislation); this we make into a law for every one, without our
6090: judgement being based on any interest whatever, _though in this case
6091: it produces such an interest_. The pleasure or pain in the former
6092: judgement is called that of taste, in the latter, that of moral feeling.
6093: 
6094: But it also interests Reason that the Ideas (for which in moral feeling
6095: it arouses an immediate interest) should have objective reality; _i.e._
6096: that nature should at least show a trace or give an indication that
6097: it contains in itself some ground for assuming a regular agreement of
6098: its products with our entirely disinterested satisfaction (which we
6099: recognise _a priori_ as a law for every one, without being able to base
6100: it upon proofs). Hence Reason must take an interest in every expression
6101: on the part of nature of an agreement of this kind. Consequently, the
6102: mind cannot ponder upon the beauty of _Nature_ without finding itself
6103: at the same time interested therein. But this interest is akin to
6104: moral, and he who takes such an interest in the beauties of nature
6105: can do so only in so far as he previously has firmly established his
6106: interest in the morally good. If, therefore, the beauty of Nature
6107: interests a man immediately we have reason for attributing to him, at
6108: least, a basis for a good moral disposition.
6109: 
6110: It will be said that this account of aesthetical judgements, as akin
6111: to the moral feeling, seems far too studied to be regarded as the
6112: true interpretation of that cipher through which Nature speaks to us
6113: figuratively in her beautiful forms. However, in the first place,
6114: this immediate interest in the beautiful is actually not common; but
6115: is peculiar to those whose mental disposition either has already been
6116: cultivated in the direction of the good or is eminently susceptible
6117: of such cultivation. In that case the analogy between the pure
6118: judgement of taste which, independently of any interest, causes us to
6119: feel a satisfaction, and also represents it _a priori_ as suitable
6120: to humanity in general, and the moral judgement that does the same
6121: thing from concepts without any clear, subtle, and premeditated
6122: reflection--this analogy leads to a similar immediate interest in the
6123: objects of the former as in those of the latter; only that in the
6124: one case the interest is free, in the other it is based on objective
6125: laws. To this is to be added our admiration for Nature, which displays
6126: itself in its beautiful products as Art, not merely by chance, but
6127: as it were designedly, in accordance with a regular arrangement, and
6128: as purposiveness without purpose. This latter, as we never meet with
6129: it outside ourselves, we naturally seek in ourselves; and, in fact,
6130: in that which constitutes the ultimate purpose of our being, viz.
6131: our moral destination. (Of this question as to the ground of the
6132: possibility of such natural purposiveness we shall first speak in the
6133: Teleology.)
6134: 
6135: It is easy to explain why the satisfaction in the pure aesthetical
6136: judgement in the case of beautiful Art is not combined with an
6137: immediate interest as it is in the case of beautiful Nature. For the
6138: former is either such an imitation of the latter that it reaches the
6139: point of deception and then produces the same effect as natural beauty
6140: (for which it is taken); or it is an art obviously directed designedly
6141: to our satisfaction. In the latter case the satisfaction in the product
6142: would, it is true, be brought about immediately by taste, but it would
6143: be only a mediate interest in the cause lying at its root, viz. an art
6144: that can only interest by means of its purpose and never in itself.
6145: It will, perhaps, be said that this is also the case, if an Object
6146: of nature interests us by its beauty only so far as it is associated
6147: with a moral Idea. But it is not the Object itself which immediately
6148: interests us, but its character in virtue of which it is qualified for
6149: such association, which therefore essentially belongs to it.
6150: 
6151: The charms in beautiful Nature, which are so often found, as it
6152: were, blended with beautiful forms, may be referred to modifications
6153: either of light (colours) or of sound (tones). For these are the only
6154: sensations that imply not merely a sensible feeling but also reflection
6155: upon the form of these modifications of Sense; and thus they involve
6156: in themselves as it were a language by which nature speaks to us,
6157: which thus seems to have a higher sense. Thus the white colour of
6158: lilies seems to determine the mind to Ideas of innocence; and the seven
6159: colours in order from the red to the violet seem to suggest the Ideas
6160: of (1) Sublimity, (2) Intrepidity, (3) Candour, (4) Friendliness, (5)
6161: Modesty, (6) Constancy, (7) Tenderness. The song of birds proclaims
6162: gladsomeness and contentment with existence. At least so we interpret
6163: nature, whether it have this design or not. But the interest which
6164: we here take in beauty has only to do with the beauty of Nature; it
6165: vanishes altogether as soon as we notice that we are deceived and
6166: that it is only Art--vanishes so completely that taste can no longer
6167: find the thing beautiful or sight find it charming. What is more
6168: highly praised by poets than the bewitching and beautiful note of the
6169: nightingale in a lonely copse on a still summer evening by the soft
6170: light of the moon? And yet we have instances of a merry host, where no
6171: such songster was to be found, deceiving to their great contentment
6172: the guests who were staying with him to enjoy the country air, by
6173: hiding in a bush a mischievous boy who knew how to produce this sound
6174: exactly like nature (by means of a reed or a tube in his mouth). But
6175: as soon as we are aware that it is a cheat, no one will remain long
6176: listening to the song which before was counted so charming. And it is
6177: just the same with the songs of all other birds. It must be Nature or
6178: be regarded as Nature, if we are to take an immediate _interest_ in the
6179: Beautiful as such; and still more is this the case if we can require
6180: that others should take an interest in it too. This happens as a matter
6181: of fact when we regard as coarse and ignoble the mental attitude of
6182: those persons who have no _feeling_ for beautiful Nature (for thus we
6183: describe a susceptibility to interest in its contemplation), and who
6184: confine themselves to eating and drinking--to the mere enjoyments of
6185: sense.
6186: 
6187: 
6188: § 43. _Of Art in general_
6189: 
6190: (1). _Art_ is distinguished from Nature, as doing (_facere_) is
6191: distinguished from acting or working generally (_agere_), and as the
6192: product or result of the former is distinguished as _work_ (_opus_)
6193: from the working (_effectus_) of the latter.
6194: 
6195: By right we ought only to describe as Art, production through freedom,
6196: _i.e._ through a will that places Reason at the basis of its actions.
6197: For although we like to call the product of bees (regularly built
6198: cells of wax) a work of art, this is only by way of analogy: as soon
6199: as we feel that this work of theirs is based on no proper rational
6200: deliberation, we say that it is a product of Nature (of instinct), and
6201: as Art only ascribe it to their Creator.
6202: 
6203: If, as sometimes happens, in searching through a bog we come upon a bit
6204: of shaped wood, we do not say: this is a product of Nature, but, of
6205: Art. Its producing cause has conceived a purpose to which the bit of
6206: wood owes its form. Elsewhere too we should see art in everything which
6207: is made so that a representation of it in its cause must have preceded
6208: its actuality (as even in the case of the bees), though the effect
6209: could not have been _thought_ by the cause. But if we call anything
6210: absolutely a work of art in order to distinguish it from a natural
6211: effect, we always understand by that a work of man.
6212: 
6213: (2). _Art_ regarded as human skill differs from _science_ (as _can_
6214: from _know_) as a practical faculty does from a theoretical, as Technic
6215: does from Theory (as mensuration from geometry). And so what we _can_
6216: do, as soon as we merely _know_ what ought to be done and therefore
6217: are sufficiently cognisant of the desired effect, is not called
6218: Art. Only that which a man, even if he knows it completely, may not
6219: therefore have the skill to accomplish, belongs to Art. _Camper_[75]
6220: describes very exactly how the best shoes must be made, but he
6221: certainly could not make one.[76]
6222: 
6223: (3). _Art_ also differs from _handicraft_; the first is called _free_,
6224: the other may be called mercenary. We regard the first as if it could
6225: only prove purposive as play, _i.e._ as occupation that is pleasant in
6226: itself. But the second is regarded as if it could only be compulsorily
6227: imposed upon one as work, _i.e._ as occupation which is unpleasant (a
6228: trouble) in itself, and which is only attractive on account of its
6229: effect (_e.g._ the wage). Whether or not in the graded list of the
6230: professions we ought to count watchmakers as artists, but smiths only
6231: as handicraftsmen, would require another point of view from which to
6232: judge than that which we are here taking up; viz. [we should have to
6233: consider] the proportion of talents which must be assumed requisite in
6234: these several occupations. Whether or not, again, under the so-called
6235: seven free arts some may be included which ought to be classed as
6236: sciences, and many that are akin rather to handicraft, I shall not
6237: here discuss. But it is not inexpedient to recall that in all free
6238: arts there is yet requisite something compulsory, or, as it is called,
6239: _mechanism_, without which the _spirit_, which must be free in art and
6240: which alone inspires the work, would have no body and would evaporate
6241: altogether; _e.g._ in poetry there must be an accuracy and wealth of
6242: language, and also prosody and metre. [It is not inexpedient, I say,
6243: to recall this], for many modern educators believe that the best way
6244: to produce a free art is to remove it from all constraint, and thus to
6245: change it from work into mere play.
6246: 
6247: 
6248: § 44. _Of beautiful Art_
6249: 
6250: There is no Science of the Beautiful, but only a Critique of it; and
6251: there is no such thing as beautiful Science, but only beautiful Art.
6252: For as regards the first point, if it could be decided scientifically,
6253: _i.e._ by proofs, whether a thing was to be regarded as beautiful or
6254: not, the judgement upon beauty would belong to science and would not
6255: be a judgement of taste. And as far as the second point is concerned,
6256: a science which should be beautiful as such is a nonentity. For if
6257: in such a science we were to ask for grounds and proofs, we would be
6258: put off with tasteful phrases (bon-mots).--The source of the common
6259: expression, _beautiful science_, is without doubt nothing else than
6260: this, as it has been rightly remarked, that for beautiful art in its
6261: entire completeness much science is requisite; _e.g._ a knowledge
6262: of ancient languages, a learned familiarity with classical authors,
6263: history, a knowledge of antiquities, etc. And hence these historical
6264: sciences, because they form the necessary preparation and basis for
6265: beautiful art, and also partly because under them is included the
6266: knowledge of the products of beautiful art (rhetoric and poetry), have
6267: come to be called beautiful sciences by a confusion of words.
6268: 
6269: If art which is adequate to the _cognition_ of a possible object
6270: performs the actions requisite therefore merely in order to make it
6271: actual, it is _mechanical_ art; but if it has for its immediate design
6272: the feeling of pleasure, it is called _aesthetical_ art. This is again
6273: either _pleasant_ or _beautiful_. It is the first, if its purpose is
6274: that the pleasure should accompany the representations [of the object]
6275: regarded as mere _sensations_; it is the second if they are regarded as
6276: _modes of cognition_.
6277: 
6278: Pleasant arts are those that are directed merely to enjoyment. Of
6279: this class are all those charming arts that can gratify a company at
6280: table; _e.g._ the art of telling stories in an entertaining way, of
6281: starting the company in frank and lively conversation, of raising them
6282: by jest and laugh to a certain pitch of merriment;[77] when, as people
6283: say, there may be a great deal of gossip at the feast, but no one
6284: will be answerable for what he says, because they are only concerned
6285: with momentary entertainment, and not with any permanent material
6286: for reflection or subsequent discussion. (Among these are also to be
6287: reckoned the way of arranging the table for enjoyment, and, at great
6288: feasts, the management of the music. This latter is a wonderful thing.
6289: It is meant to dispose to gaiety the minds of the guests, regarded
6290: solely as a pleasant noise, without any one paying the least attention
6291: to its composition; and it favours the free conversation of each
6292: with his neighbour.) Again, to this class belong all games which
6293: bring with them no further interest than that of making the time pass
6294: imperceptibly.
6295: 
6296: On the other hand, beautiful art is a mode of representation which is
6297: purposive for itself, and which, although devoid of [definite] purpose,
6298: yet furthers the culture of the mental powers in reference to social
6299: communication.
6300: 
6301: The universal communicability of a pleasure carries with it in its very
6302: concept that the pleasure is not one of enjoyment, from mere sensation,
6303: but must be derived from reflection; and thus aesthetical art, as
6304: the art of beauty, has for standard the reflective Judgement and not
6305: sensation.
6306: 
6307: 
6308: § 45. _Beautiful Art is an art, in so far as it seems like nature_
6309: 
6310: In a product of beautiful art we must become conscious that it is Art
6311: and not Nature; but yet the purposiveness in its form must seem to be
6312: as free from all constraint of arbitrary rules as if it were a product
6313: of mere nature. On this feeling of freedom in the play of our cognitive
6314: faculties, which must at the same time be purposive, rests that
6315: pleasure which alone is universally communicable, without being based
6316: on concepts. Nature is beautiful because it looks like Art; and Art can
6317: only be called beautiful if we are conscious of it as Art while yet it
6318: looks like Nature.
6319: 
6320: For whether we are dealing with natural or with artificial beauty we
6321: can say generally: _That is beautiful which pleases in the mere act of
6322: judging it_ (not in the sensation of it, or by means of a concept). Now
6323: art has always a definite design of producing something. But if this
6324: something were bare sensation (something merely subjective), which is
6325: to be accompanied with pleasure, the product would please in the act
6326: of judgement only by mediation of sensible feeling. And again, if the
6327: design were directed towards the production of a definite Object, then,
6328: if this were attained by art, the Object would only please by means of
6329: concepts. But in both cases the art would not please _in the mere act
6330: of judging_; _i.e._ it would not please as beautiful, but as mechanical.
6331: 
6332: Hence the purposiveness in the product of beautiful art, although it
6333: is designed, must not seem to be designed; _i.e._ beautiful art must
6334: _look_ like nature, although we are conscious of it as art. But a
6335: product of art appears like nature when, although its agreement with
6336: the rules, according to which alone the product can become what it
6337: ought to be, is _punctiliously_ observed, yet this is not _painfully_
6338: apparent; [the form of the schools does not obtrude itself][78]--it
6339: shows no trace of the rule having been before the eyes of the artist
6340: and having fettered his mental powers.
6341: 
6342: 
6343: § 46. _Beautiful Art is the art of genius_
6344: 
6345: _Genius_ is the talent (or natural gift) which gives the rule to Art.
6346: Since talent, as the innate productive faculty of the artist, belongs
6347: itself to Nature, we may express the matter thus: _Genius_ is the
6348: innate mental disposition (_ingenium_) _through which_ Nature gives the
6349: rule to Art.
6350: 
6351: Whatever may be thought of this definition, whether it is merely
6352: arbitrary or whether it is adequate to the concept that we are
6353: accustomed to combine with the word _genius_ (which is to be examined
6354: in the following paragraphs), we can prove already beforehand that
6355: according to the signification of the word here adopted, beautiful arts
6356: must necessarily be considered as arts of _genius_.
6357: 
6358: For every art presupposes rules by means of which in the first instance
6359: a product, if it is to be called artistic, is represented as possible.
6360: But the concept of beautiful art does not permit the judgement upon the
6361: beauty of a product to be derived from any rule, which has a _concept_
6362: as its determining ground, and therefore has at its basis a concept
6363: of the way in which the product is possible. Therefore, beautiful art
6364: cannot itself devise the rule according to which it can bring about its
6365: product. But since at the same time a product can never be called Art
6366: without some precedent rule, Nature in the subject must (by the harmony
6367: of its faculties) give the rule to Art; _i.e._ beautiful Art is only
6368: possible as a product of Genius.
6369: 
6370: We thus see (1) that genius is a _talent_ for producing that for which
6371: no definite rule can be given; it is not a mere aptitude for what can
6372: be learnt by a rule. Hence _originality_ must be its first property.
6373: (2) But since it also can produce original nonsense, its products
6374: must be models, _i.e._ _exemplary_; and they consequently ought not
6375: to spring from imitation, but must serve as a standard or rule of
6376: judgement for others. (3) It cannot describe or indicate scientifically
6377: how it brings about its products, but it gives the rule just as nature
6378: does. Hence the author of a product for which he is indebted to his
6379: genius does not himself know how he has come by his Ideas; and he has
6380: not the power to devise the like at pleasure or in accordance with a
6381: plan, and to communicate it to others in precepts that will enable them
6382: to produce similar products. (Hence it is probable that the word genius
6383: is derived from _genius_, that peculiar guiding and guardian spirit
6384: given to a man at his birth, from whose suggestion these original
6385: Ideas proceed.) (4) Nature by the medium of genius does not prescribe
6386: rules to Science, but to Art; and to it only in so far as it is to be
6387: beautiful Art.
6388: 
6389: 
6390: § 47. _Elucidation and confirmation of the above explanation of Genius_
6391: 
6392: Every one is agreed that genius is entirely opposed to the _spirit of
6393: imitation_. Now since learning is nothing but imitation, it follows
6394: that the greatest ability and teachableness (capacity) regarded _quâ_
6395: teachableness, cannot avail for genius. Even if a man thinks or invents
6396: for himself, and does not merely take in what others have taught,
6397: even if he discovers many things in art and science, this is not the
6398: right ground for calling such a (perhaps great) _head_, a genius (as
6399: opposed to him who because he can only learn and imitate is called a
6400: _shallow-pate_). For even these things could be learned, they lie in
6401: the natural path of him who investigates and reflects according to
6402: rules; and they do not differ specifically from what can be acquired
6403: by industry through imitation. Thus we can readily learn all that
6404: _Newton_ has set forth in his immortal work on the Principles of
6405: Natural Philosophy, however great a head was required to discover it;
6406: but we cannot learn to write spirited poetry, however express may be
6407: the precepts of the art and however excellent its models. The reason
6408: is that _Newton_ could make all his steps, from the first elements
6409: of geometry to his own great and profound discoveries, intuitively
6410: plain and definite as regards consequence, not only to himself but
6411: to every one else. But a _Homer_ or a _Wieland_ cannot show how his
6412: Ideas, so rich in fancy and yet so full of thought, come together in
6413: his head, simply because he does not know and therefore cannot teach
6414: others. In Science then the greatest discoverer only differs in degree
6415: from his laborious imitator and pupil; but he differs specifically
6416: from him whom Nature has gifted for beautiful Art. And in this there
6417: is no depreciation of those great men to whom the human race owes so
6418: much gratitude, as compared with nature’s favourites in respect of
6419: the talent for beautiful art. For in the fact that the former talent
6420: is directed to the ever-advancing greater perfection of knowledge and
6421: every advantage depending on it, and at the same time to the imparting
6422: this same knowledge to others--in this it has a great superiority
6423: over [the talent of] those who deserve the honour of being called
6424: geniuses. For art stands still at a certain point; a boundary is set to
6425: it beyond which it cannot go, which presumably has been reached long
6426: ago and cannot be extended further. Again, artistic skill cannot be
6427: communicated; it is imparted to every artist immediately by the hand
6428: of nature; and so it dies with him, until nature endows another in the
6429: same way, so that he only needs an example in order to put in operation
6430: in a similar fashion the talent of which he is conscious.
6431: 
6432: If now it is a natural gift which must prescribe its rule to art (as
6433: beautiful art), of what kind is this rule? It cannot be reduced to
6434: a formula and serve as a precept, for then the judgement upon the
6435: beautiful would be determinable according to concepts; but the rule
6436: must be abstracted from the fact, _i.e._ from the product, on which
6437: others may try their own talent by using it as a model, not to be
6438: _copied_ but to be _imitated_. How this is possible is hard to explain.
6439: The Ideas of the artist excite like Ideas in his pupils if nature has
6440: endowed them with a like proportion of their mental powers. Hence
6441: models of beautiful art are the only means of handing down these Ideas
6442: to posterity. This cannot be done by mere descriptions, especially not
6443: in the case of the arts of speech, and in this latter classical models
6444: are only to be had in the old dead languages, now preserved only as
6445: “the learned languages.”
6446: 
6447: Although mechanical and beautiful art are very different, the first
6448: being a mere art of industry and learning and the second of genius, yet
6449: there is no beautiful art in which there is not a mechanical element
6450: that can be comprehended by rules and followed accordingly, and in
6451: which therefore there must be something _scholastic_ as an essential
6452: condition. For [in every art] some purpose must be conceived; otherwise
6453: we could not ascribe the product to art at all, and it would be a mere
6454: product of chance. But in order to accomplish a purpose, definite rules
6455: from which we cannot dispense ourselves are requisite. Now since the
6456: originality of the talent constitutes an essential (though not the
6457: only) element in the character of genius, shallow heads believe that
6458: they cannot better show themselves to be full-blown geniuses than by
6459: throwing off the constraint of all rules; they believe, in effect, that
6460: one could make a braver show on the back of a wild horse than on the
6461: back of a trained animal. Genius can only furnish rich _material_ for
6462: products of beautiful art; its execution and its _form_ require talent
6463: cultivated in the schools, in order to make such a use of this material
6464: as will stand examination by the Judgement. But it is quite ridiculous
6465: for a man to speak and decide like a genius in things which require
6466: the most careful investigation by Reason. One does not know whether to
6467: laugh more at the impostor who spreads such a mist round him that we
6468: cannot clearly use our Judgement and so use our Imagination the more,
6469: or at the public which naïvely imagines that his inability to cognise
6470: clearly and to comprehend the masterpiece before him arises from new
6471: truths crowding in on him in such abundance that details (duly weighed
6472: definitions and accurate examination of fundamental propositions) seem
6473: but clumsy work.
6474: 
6475: 
6476: § 48. _Of the relation of Genius to Taste_
6477: 
6478: For _judging_ of beautiful objects as such, _taste_ is requisite;
6479: but for beautiful art, _i.e._ for the _production_ of such objects,
6480: _genius_ is requisite.
6481: 
6482: If we consider genius as the talent for beautiful art (which the
6483: special meaning of the word implies) and in this point of view analyse
6484: it into the faculties which must concur to constitute such a talent, it
6485: is necessary in the first instance to determine exactly the difference
6486: between natural beauty, the judging of which requires only Taste, and
6487: artificial beauty, whose possibility (to which reference must be made
6488: in judging such an object) requires Genius.
6489: 
6490: A natural beauty is a _beautiful thing_; artificial beauty is a
6491: _beautiful representation_ of a thing.
6492: 
6493: In order to judge of a natural beauty as such I need not have
6494: beforehand a concept of what sort of thing the object is to be; _i.e._
6495: I need not know its material purposiveness (the purpose), but its mere
6496: form pleases by itself in the act of judging it without any knowledge
6497: of the purpose. But if the object is given as a product of art, and as
6498: such is to be declared beautiful, then, because art always supposes a
6499: purpose in the cause (and its causality), there must be at bottom in
6500: the first instance a concept of what the thing is to be. And as the
6501: agreement of the manifold in a thing with its inner destination, its
6502: purpose, constitutes the perfection of the thing, it follows that in
6503: judging of artificial beauty the perfection of the thing must be taken
6504: into account; but in judging of natural beauty (as _such_) there is no
6505: question at all about this.--It is true that in judging of objects of
6506: nature, especially objects endowed with life, _e.g._ a man or a horse,
6507: their objective purposiveness also is commonly taken into consideration
6508: in judging of their beauty; but then the judgement is no longer purely
6509: aesthetical, _i.e._ a mere judgement of taste. Nature is no longer
6510: judged inasmuch as it appears like art, but in so far as it _is_ actual
6511: (although superhuman) art; and the teleological judgement serves as the
6512: basis and condition of the aesthetical, as a condition to which the
6513: latter must have respect. In such a case, _e.g._ if it is said “that is
6514: a beautiful woman,” we think nothing else than this: nature represents
6515: in her figure the purposes in view in the shape of a woman’s figure.
6516: For we must look beyond the mere form to a concept, if the object
6517: is to be thought in such a way by means of a logically conditioned
6518: aesthetical judgement.
6519: 
6520: Beautiful art shows its superiority in this, that it describes as
6521: beautiful things which may be in nature ugly or displeasing.[79]
6522: The Furies, diseases, the devastations of war, etc., may [even
6523: regarded as calamitous],[80] be described as very beautiful, and even
6524: represented in a picture. There is only one kind of ugliness which
6525: cannot be represented in accordance with nature, without destroying
6526: all aesthetical satisfaction and consequently artificial beauty;
6527: viz. that which excites _disgust_. For in this peculiar sensation,
6528: which rests on mere imagination, the object is represented as it
6529: were obtruding itself for our enjoyment while we strive against it
6530: with all our might. And the artistic representation of the object
6531: is no longer distinguished from the nature of the object itself in
6532: our sensation, and thus it is impossible that it can be regarded as
6533: beautiful. The art of sculpture again, because in its products art is
6534: almost interchangeable with nature, excludes from its creations the
6535: immediate representation of ugly objects; _e.g._ it represents death
6536: by a beautiful genius, the warlike spirit by Mars, and permits [all
6537: such things] to be represented only by an allegory or attribute[81]
6538: that has a pleasing effect, and thus only indirectly by the aid of the
6539: interpretation of Reason, and not for the mere aesthetical Judgement.
6540: 
6541: So much for the beautiful representation of an object, which is
6542: properly only the form of the presentation of a concept, and the means
6543: by which the latter is communicated universally.--But to give this form
6544: to the product of beautiful art, mere taste is requisite. By taste,
6545: after he has exercised and corrected it by manifold examples from art
6546: or nature, the artist checks his work; and after many, often toilsome,
6547: attempts to content taste he finds the form which satisfies him. Hence
6548: this form is not, as it were, a thing of inspiration or the result of a
6549: free swing of the mental powers, but of a slow and even painful process
6550: of improvement, by which he seeks to render it adequate to his thought,
6551: without detriment to the freedom of the play of his powers.
6552: 
6553: But taste is merely a judging and not a productive faculty; and what
6554: is appropriate to it is not therefore a work of beautiful art. It
6555: may be only a product belonging to useful and mechanical art or even
6556: to science, produced according to definite rules that can be learned
6557: and must be exactly followed. But the pleasing form that is given to
6558: it is only the vehicle of communication, and a mode, as it were, of
6559: presenting it, in respect of which we remain free to a certain extent,
6560: although it is combined with a definite purpose. Thus we desire that
6561: table appointments, a moral treatise, even a sermon, should have
6562: in themselves this form of beautiful art, without it seeming to be
6563: _sought_: but we do not therefore call these things works of beautiful
6564: art. Under the latter class are reckoned a poem, a piece of music, a
6565: picture gallery, etc.; and in some would-be works of beautiful art
6566: we find genius without taste, while in others we find taste without
6567: genius.
6568: 
6569: 
6570: § 49. _Of the faculties of the mind that constitute Genius_
6571: 
6572: We say of certain products of which we expect that they should at
6573: least in part appear as beautiful art, they are without _spirit_[82];
6574: although we find nothing to blame in them on the score of taste. A poem
6575: may be very neat and elegant, but without spirit. A history may be
6576: exact and well arranged, but without spirit. A festal discourse may be
6577: solid and at the same time elaborate, but without spirit. Conversation
6578: is often not devoid of entertainment, but yet without spirit: even of
6579: a woman we say that she is pretty, an agreeable talker, and courteous,
6580: but without spirit. What then do we mean by spirit?
6581: 
6582: _Spirit_, in an aesthetical sense, is the name given to the animating
6583: principle of the mind. But that whereby this principle animates the
6584: soul, the material which it applies to that [purpose], is that which
6585: puts the mental powers purposively into swing, _i.e._ into such a
6586: play as maintains itself and strengthens the [mental] powers in their
6587: exercise.
6588: 
6589: Now I maintain that this principle is no other than the faculty of
6590: presenting _aesthetical Ideas_. And by an aesthetical Idea I understand
6591: that representation of the Imagination which occasions much thought,
6592: without, however, any definite thought, _i.e._ any _concept_, being
6593: capable of being adequate to it; it consequently cannot be completely
6594: compassed and made intelligible by language.--We easily see that it is
6595: the counterpart (pendant) of a _rational Idea_, which conversely is a
6596: concept to which no _intuition_ (or representation of the Imagination)
6597: can be adequate.
6598: 
6599: The Imagination (as a productive faculty of cognition) is very powerful
6600: in creating another nature, as it were, out of the material that
6601: actual nature gives it. We entertain ourselves with it when experience
6602: proves too commonplace, and by it we remould experience, always indeed
6603: in accordance with analogical laws, but yet also in accordance with
6604: principles which occupy a higher place in Reason (laws too which are
6605: just as natural to us as those by which Understanding comprehends
6606: empirical nature). Thus we feel our freedom from the law of association
6607: (which attaches to the empirical employment of Imagination), so that
6608: the material which we borrow from nature in accordance with this law
6609: can be worked up into something different which surpasses nature.
6610: 
6611: Such representations of the Imagination we may call _Ideas_, partly
6612: because they at least strive after something which lies beyond the
6613: bounds of experience, and so seek to approximate to a presentation of
6614: concepts of Reason (intellectual Ideas), thus giving to the latter the
6615: appearance of objective reality,--but especially because no concept can
6616: be fully adequate to them as internal intuitions. The poet ventures to
6617: realise to sense, rational Ideas of invisible beings, the kingdom of
6618: the blessed, hell, eternity, creation, etc.; or even if he deals with
6619: things of which there are examples in experience,--_e.g._ death, envy
6620: and all vices, also love, fame, and the like,--he tries, by means of
6621: Imagination, which emulates the play of Reason in its quest after a
6622: maximum, to go beyond the limits of experience and to present them
6623: to Sense with a completeness of which there is no example in nature.
6624: It is, properly speaking, in the art of the poet, that the faculty
6625: of aesthetical Ideas can manifest itself in its full measure. But
6626: this faculty, considered in itself, is properly only a talent (of the
6627: Imagination).
6628: 
6629: If now we place under a concept a representation of the Imagination
6630: belonging to its presentation, but which occasions solely by itself
6631: more thought than can ever be comprehended in a definite concept,
6632: and which therefore enlarges aesthetically the concept itself in an
6633: unbounded fashion,--the Imagination is here creative, and it brings
6634: the faculty of intellectual Ideas (the Reason) into movement; _i.e._ a
6635: movement, occasioned by a representation, towards more thought (though
6636: belonging, no doubt, to the concept of the object) than can be grasped
6637: in the representation or made clear.
6638: 
6639: Those forms which do not constitute the presentation of a given concept
6640: itself but only, as approximate representations of the Imagination,
6641: express the consequences bound up with it and its relationship to
6642: other concepts, are called (aesthetical) _attributes_ of an object,
6643: whose concept as a rational Idea cannot be adequately presented.
6644: Thus Jupiter’s eagle with the lightning in its claws is an attribute
6645: of the mighty king of heaven, as the peacock is of its magnificent
6646: queen. They do not, like _logical attributes_, represent what lies in
6647: our concepts of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but something
6648: different, which gives occasion to the Imagination to spread itself
6649: over a number of kindred representations, that arouse more thought
6650: than can be expressed in a concept determined by words. They furnish
6651: an _aesthetical Idea_, which for that rational Idea takes the place
6652: of logical presentation; and thus as their proper office they enliven
6653: the mind by opening out to it the prospect into an illimitable field
6654: of kindred representations. But beautiful art does this not only in
6655: the case of painting or sculpture (in which the term “attribute” is
6656: commonly employed): poetry and rhetoric also get the spirit that
6657: animates their works simply from the aesthetical attributes of the
6658: object, which accompany the logical and stimulate the Imagination, so
6659: that it thinks more by their aid, although in an undeveloped way, than
6660: could be comprehended in a concept and therefore in a definite form of
6661: words.-- For the sake of brevity I must limit myself to a few examples
6662: only.
6663: 
6664: When the great King[83] in one of his poems expresses himself as
6665: follows:
6666: 
6667:     “Oui, finissons sans trouble et mourons sans regrets,
6668:     En laissant l’univers comblé de nos bienfaits.
6669:     Ainsi l’astre du jour au bout de sa carrière,
6670:     Répand sur l’horizon une douce lumière;
6671:     Et les derniers rayons qu’il darde dans les airs,
6672:     Sont les derniers soupirs qu’il donne à l’univers;”
6673: 
6674: he quickens his rational Idea of a cosmopolitan disposition at the end
6675: of life by an attribute which the Imagination (in remembering all the
6676: pleasures of a beautiful summer day that are recalled at its close
6677: by a serene evening) associates with that representation, and which
6678: excites a number of sensations and secondary representations for which
6679: no expression is found. On the other hand, an intellectual concept may
6680: serve conversely as an attribute for a representation of sense and
6681: so can quicken this latter by means of the Idea of the supersensible;
6682: but only by the aesthetical [element], that subjectively attaches to
6683: the concept of the latter, being here employed. Thus, for example, a
6684: certain poet[84] says, in his description of a beautiful morning:
6685: 
6686:           “The sun arose
6687:     As calm from virtue springs.”
6688: 
6689: The consciousness of virtue, even if one only places oneself in
6690: thought in the position of a virtuous man, diffuses in the mind a
6691: multitude of sublime and restful feelings and a boundless prospect of
6692: a joyful future, to which no expression measured by a definite concept
6693: completely attains.[85]
6694: 
6695: In a word the aesthetical Idea is a representation of the Imagination
6696: associated with a given concept, which is bound up with such a
6697: multiplicity of partial representations in its free employment, that
6698: for it no expression marking a definite concept can be found; and such
6699: a representation, therefore, adds to a concept much ineffable thought,
6700: the feeling of which quickens the cognitive faculties, and with
6701: language, which is the mere letter, binds up spirit also.
6702: 
6703: The mental powers, therefore, whose union (in a certain relation)
6704: constitutes _genius_ are Imagination and Understanding. In the
6705: employment of the Imagination for cognition it submits to the
6706: constraint of the Understanding and is subject to the limitation of
6707: being conformable to the concept of the latter. On the other hand, in
6708: an aesthetical point of view it is free to furnish unsought, over and
6709: above that agreement with a concept, abundance of undeveloped material
6710: for the Understanding; to which the Understanding paid no regard in its
6711: concept, but which it applies, though not objectively for cognition,
6712: yet subjectively to quicken the cognitive powers and therefore also
6713: indirectly to cognitions. Thus genius properly consists in the happy
6714: relation [between these faculties], which no science can teach and no
6715: industry can learn, by which Ideas are found for a given concept; and
6716: on the other hand, we thus find for these Ideas the _expression_, by
6717: means of which the subjective state of mind brought about by them,
6718: as an accompaniment of the concept, can be communicated to others.
6719: The latter talent is properly speaking what is called spirit; for
6720: to express the ineffable element in the state of mind implied by a
6721: certain representation and to make it universally communicable--whether
6722: the expression be in speech or painting or statuary--this requires
6723: a faculty of seizing the quickly passing play of Imagination and of
6724: unifying it in a concept (which is even on that account original
6725: and discloses a new rule that could not have been inferred from any
6726: preceding principles or examples), that can be communicated without any
6727: constraint [of rules].[86]
6728: 
6729:        *       *       *       *       *
6730: 
6731: If after this analysis we look back to the explanation given above
6732: of what is called _genius_, we find: _first_, that it is a talent for
6733: Art, not for Science, in which clearly known rules must go beforehand
6734: and determine the procedure. _Secondly_, as an artistic talent it
6735: presupposes a definite concept of the product, as the purpose, and
6736: therefore Understanding; but it also presupposes a representation
6737: (although an indeterminate one) of the material, _i.e._ of the
6738: intuition, for the presentment of this concept; and, therefore, a
6739: relation between the Imagination and the Understanding. _Thirdly_, it
6740: shows itself not so much in the accomplishment of the proposed purpose
6741: in a presentment of a definite _concept_, as in the enunciation or
6742: expression of _aesthetical Ideas_, which contain abundant material for
6743: that very design; and consequently it represents the Imagination as
6744: free from all guidance of rules and yet as purposive in reference to
6745: the presentment of the given concept. Finally, in the _fourth_ place,
6746: the unsought undesigned subjective purposiveness in the free accordance
6747: of the Imagination with the legality of the Understanding presupposes
6748: such a proportion and disposition of these faculties as no following of
6749: rules, whether of science or of mechanical imitation, can bring about,
6750: but which only the nature of the subject can produce.
6751: 
6752: In accordance with these suppositions genius is the exemplary
6753: originality of the natural gifts of a subject in the _free_ employment
6754: of his cognitive faculties. In this way the product of a genius (as
6755: regards what is to be ascribed to genius and not to possible learning
6756: or schooling) is an example, not to be imitated (for then that which
6757: in it is genius and constitutes the spirit of the work would be lost),
6758: but to be followed, by another genius; whom it awakens to a feeling of
6759: his own originality and whom it stirs so to exercise his art in freedom
6760: from the constraint of rules, that thereby a new rule is gained for
6761: art, and thus his talent shows itself to be exemplary. But because a
6762: genius is a favourite of nature and must be regarded by us as a rare
6763: phenomenon, his example produces for other good heads a school, _i.e._
6764: a methodical system of teaching according to rules, so far as these can
6765: be derived from the peculiarities of the products of his spirit. For
6766: such persons beautiful art is so far imitation, to which nature through
6767: the medium of a genius supplied the rule.
6768: 
6769: But this imitation becomes a mere _aping_, if the scholar _copies_
6770: everything down to the deformities, which the genius must have let
6771: pass only because he could not well remove them without weakening his
6772: Idea. This mental characteristic is meritorious only in the case of
6773: a genius. A certain _audacity_ in expression--and in general many a
6774: departure from common rules--becomes him well, but it is in no way
6775: worthy of imitation; it always remains a fault in itself which we
6776: must seek to remove, though the genius is as it were privileged to
6777: commit it, because the inimitable rush of his spirit would suffer
6778: from over-anxious carefulness. _Mannerism_ is another kind of aping,
6779: viz. of mere _peculiarity_ (originality) in general; by which a man
6780: separates himself as far as possible from imitators, without however
6781: possessing the talent to be at the same time _exemplary_.--There
6782: are indeed in general two ways (_modi_) in which such a man may put
6783: together his notions of expressing himself; the one is called a
6784: _manner_ (_modus aestheticus_), the other a _method_ (_modus logicus_).
6785: They differ in this, that the former has no other standard than the
6786: _feeling_ of unity in the presentment, but the latter follows definite
6787: _principles_; hence the former alone avails for beautiful art. But an
6788: artistic product is said to show _mannerism_ only when the exposition
6789: of the artist’s Idea is _founded_ on its very singularity, and is not
6790: made appropriate to the Idea itself. The ostentatious (_précieux_),
6791: contorted, and affected [manner, adopted] to differentiate oneself from
6792: ordinary persons (though devoid of spirit) is like the behaviour of a
6793: man of whom we say, that he hears himself talk, or who stands and moves
6794: about as if he were on a stage in order to be stared at; this always
6795: betrays a bungler.
6796: 
6797: 
6798: § 50. _Of the combination of Taste with Genius in the products of
6799: beautiful Art_
6800: 
6801: To ask whether it is more important for the things of beautiful art
6802: that Genius or Taste should be displayed, is the same as to ask whether
6803: in it more depends on Imagination or on Judgement. Now, since in
6804: respect of the first an art is rather said to be _full of spirit_, but
6805: only deserves to be called a _beautiful_ art on account of the second;
6806: this latter is at least, as its indispensable condition (_conditio sine
6807: qua non_), the most important thing to which one has to look in the
6808: judging of art as beautiful art. Abundance and originality of Ideas
6809: are less necessary to beauty than the accordance of the Imagination in
6810: its freedom with the conformity to law of the Understanding. For all
6811: the abundance of the former produces in lawless freedom nothing but
6812: nonsense; on the other hand, the Judgement is the faculty by which it
6813: is adjusted to the Understanding.
6814: 
6815: Taste, like the Judgement in general, is the discipline (or training)
6816: of Genius; it clips its wings closely, and makes it cultured and
6817: polished; but, at the same time, it gives guidance as to where and
6818: how far it may extend itself, if it is to remain purposive. And while
6819: it brings clearness and order into the multitude of the thoughts, it
6820: makes the Ideas susceptible of being permanently and, at the same time,
6821: universally assented to, and capable of being followed by others, and
6822: of an ever-progressive culture. If, then, in the conflict of these two
6823: properties in a product something must be sacrificed, it should be
6824: rather on the side of genius; and the Judgement, which in the things of
6825: beautiful art gives its decision from its own proper principles, will
6826: rather sacrifice the freedom and wealth of the Imagination than permit
6827: anything prejudicial to the Understanding.
6828: 
6829: For beautiful art, therefore, _Imagination_, _Understanding_, _Spirit_,
6830: and _Taste_ are requisite.[87]
6831: 
6832: 
6833: § 51. _Of the division of the beautiful arts_
6834: 
6835: We may describe beauty in general (whether natural or artificial) as
6836: the _expression_ of aesthetical Ideas; only that in beautiful Art this
6837: Idea must be occasioned by a concept of the Object; whilst in beautiful
6838: Nature the mere reflection upon a given intuition, without any concept
6839: of what the object is to be, is sufficient for the awakening and
6840: communicating of the Idea of which that Object is regarded as the
6841: _expression_.
6842: 
6843: If, then, we wish to make a division of the beautiful arts, we
6844: cannot choose a more convenient principle, at least tentatively,
6845: than the analogy of art with the mode of expression of which men
6846: avail themselves in speech, in order to communicate to one another
6847: as perfectly as possible not merely their concepts but also their
6848: sensations.[88]--This is done by _word_, _deportment_, and _tone_
6849: (articulation, gesticulation, and modulation). It is only by the
6850: combination of these three kinds of expression that communication
6851: between the speaker [and his hearers] can be complete. For thus
6852: thought, intuition, and sensation are transmitted to others
6853: simultaneously and conjointly.
6854: 
6855: There are, therefore, only three kinds of beautiful arts; the arts of
6856: _speech_, the _formative_ arts, and the art of the _play of sensations_
6857: (as external sensible impressions). We may also arrange a division by
6858: dichotomy; thus beautiful art may be divided into the art of expression
6859: of thoughts and of intuitions; and these further subdivided in
6860: accordance with their form or their matter (sensation). But this would
6861: appear to be too abstract, and not so accordant with ordinary concepts.
6862: 
6863: (1) The arts of SPEECH are _rhetoric_ and _poetry_. _Rhetoric_ is the
6864: art of carrying on a serious business of the Understanding as if it
6865: were a free play of the Imagination; _poetry_, the art of conducting a
6866: free play of the Imagination as if it were a serious business of the
6867: Understanding.
6868: 
6869: The _orator_, then, promises a serious business, and in order to
6870: entertain his audience conducts it as if it were a mere _play_ with
6871: Ideas. The _poet_ merely promises an entertaining play with Ideas,
6872: and yet it has the same effect upon the Understanding as if he had
6873: only intended to carry on its business. The combination and harmony of
6874: both cognitive faculties, Sensibility and Understanding, which cannot
6875: dispense with one another, but which yet cannot well be united without
6876: constraint and mutual prejudice, must appear to be undesigned and so
6877: to be brought about by themselves: otherwise it is not _beautiful_
6878: art. Hence, all that is studied and anxious must be avoided in it, for
6879: beautiful art must be free art in a double sense. It is not a work like
6880: that of a tradesman, the magnitude of which can be judged, exacted, or
6881: paid for, according to a definite standard; and again, though the mind
6882: is occupied, still it feels itself contented and stimulated, without
6883: looking to any other purpose (independently of reward.)
6884: 
6885: The orator therefore gives something which he does not promise, viz.
6886: an entertaining play of the Imagination; but he also fails to supply
6887: what he did promise, which is indeed his announced business, viz. the
6888: purposive occupation of the Understanding. On the other hand, the poet
6889: promises little and announces a mere play with Ideas; but he supplies
6890: something which is worth occupying ourselves with, because he provides
6891: in this play food for the Understanding, and by the aid of Imagination
6892: gives life to his concepts. [Thus the orator on the whole gives less,
6893: the poet more, than he promises.][89]
6894: 
6895: (2) The FORMATIVE arts, or those by which expression is found for Ideas
6896: in _sensible intuition_ (not by representations of mere Imagination
6897: that are aroused by words), are either arts of _sensible truth_ or
6898: of _sensible illusion_. The former is called _Plastic_, the latter
6899: _Painting_. Both express Ideas by figures in space; the former makes
6900: figures cognisable by two senses, sight and touch (although not by
6901: the latter as far as beauty is concerned); the latter only by one,
6902: the first of these. The aesthetical Idea (the archetype or original
6903: image) is fundamental for both in the Imagination, but the figure which
6904: expresses this (the ectype or copy) is either given in its bodily
6905: extension (as the object itself exists), or as it paints itself on the
6906: eye (according to its appearance when projected on a flat surface). In
6907: the first case[90] the condition given to reflection may be either the
6908: reference to an actual purpose or only the semblance of it.
6909: 
6910: To _Plastic_, the first kind of beautiful formative Art, belong
6911: _Sculpture_ and _Architecture_. The _first_ presents corporeally
6912: concepts of things, _as they might have existed in nature_ (though
6913: as beautiful art it has regard to aesthetical purposiveness). The
6914: _second_ is the art of presenting concepts of things that are possible
6915: _only through Art_, and whose form has for its determining ground not
6916: nature but an arbitrary purpose, with the view of presenting them with
6917: aesthetical purposiveness. In the latter the chief point is a certain
6918: _use_ of the artistic object, by which condition the aesthetical Ideas
6919: are limited. In the former the main design is the mere _expression_ of
6920: aesthetical Ideas. Thus statues of men, gods, animals, etc., are of
6921: the first kind; but temples, splendid buildings for public assemblies,
6922: even dwelling-houses, triumphal arches, columns, mausoleums, and the
6923: like, erected in honourable remembrance, belong to Architecture. Indeed
6924: all house furniture (upholsterer’s work and such like things which are
6925: for use) may be reckoned under this art; because the suitability of a
6926: product for a certain use is the essential thing in an _architectural
6927: work_. On the other hand, a mere _piece of sculpture_, which is simply
6928: made for show and which is to please in itself, is as a corporeal
6929: presentation a mere imitation of nature, though with a reference to
6930: aesthetical Ideas; in it _sensible truth_ is not to be carried so far
6931: that the product ceases to look like art and looks like a product of
6932: the elective will.
6933: 
6934: _Painting_, as the second kind of formative art, which presents a
6935: _sensible illusion_ artificially combined with Ideas, I would divide
6936: into the art of the beautiful _depicting of nature_ and that of the
6937: beautiful _arrangement of its products_. The first is _painting
6938: proper_, the second is the art of _landscape gardening_. The first
6939: gives only the illusory appearance of corporeal extension; the second
6940: gives this in accordance with truth, but only the appearance of
6941: utility and availableness for other purposes than the mere play of
6942: the Imagination in the contemplation of its forms.[91] This latter is
6943: nothing else than the ornamentation of the soil with a variety of
6944: those things (grasses, flowers, shrubs, trees, even ponds, hillocks,
6945: and dells) which nature presents to an observer, only arranged
6946: differently and in conformity with certain Ideas. But, again, the
6947: beautiful arrangement of corporeal things is only apparent to the
6948: eye, like painting; the sense of touch cannot supply any intuitive
6949: presentation of such a form. Under painting in the wide sense I would
6950: reckon the decoration of rooms by the aid of tapestry, bric-a-brac, and
6951: all beautiful furniture which is merely available to be _looked_ at;
6952: and the same may be said of the art of tasteful dressing (with rings,
6953: snuff-boxes, etc.). For a bed of various flowers, a room filled with
6954: various ornaments (including under this head even ladies’ finery), make
6955: at a fête a kind of picture; which, like pictures properly so-called
6956: (that are not intended to _teach_ either history or natural science),
6957: has in view merely the entertainment of the Imagination in free play
6958: with Ideas, and the occupation of the aesthetical Judgement without
6959: any definite purpose. The detailed work in all this decoration may be
6960: quite distinct in the different cases and may require very different
6961: artists; but the judgement of taste upon whatever is beautiful in
6962: these various arts is always determined in the same way: viz. it only
6963: judges the forms (without any reference to a purpose) as they present
6964: themselves to the eye either singly or in combination, according to the
6965: effect they produce upon the Imagination.--But that formative art may
6966: be compared (by analogy) with deportment in speech is justified by the
6967: fact that the spirit of the artist supplies by these figures a bodily
6968: expression to his thought and its mode, and makes the thing itself as
6969: it were speak in mimic language. This is a very common play of our
6970: fancy, which attributes to lifeless things a spirit suitable to their
6971: form by which they speak to us.
6972: 
6973: (3) The art of the BEAUTIFUL PLAY OF SENSATIONS (externally
6974: stimulated), which admits at the same time of universal communication,
6975: can be concerned with nothing else than the proportion of the
6976: different degrees of the disposition (tension) of the sense, to which
6977: the sensation belongs, _i.e._ with its tone. In this far-reaching
6978: signification of the word it may be divided into the artistic play of
6979: the sensations of hearing and sight, _i.e._ into _Music_ and the _Art
6980: of colour_.--It is noteworthy that these two senses, besides their
6981: susceptibility for impressions so far as these are needed to gain
6982: concepts of external objects, are also capable of a peculiar sensation
6983: bound up therewith, of which we cannot strictly decide whether it is
6984: based on sense or reflection. This susceptibility may sometimes be
6985: wanting, although in other respects the sense, as regards its use for
6986: the cognition of Objects, is not at all deficient but is peculiarly
6987: fine. That is, we cannot say with certainty whether colours or tones
6988: (sounds) are merely pleasant sensations or whether they form in
6989: themselves a beautiful play of sensations, and as such bring with them
6990: in aesthetical judgement a satisfaction in their form. If we think
6991: of the velocity of the vibrations of light, or in the second case
6992: of the air, which probably far surpasses all our faculty of judging
6993: immediately in perception the time interval between them, we must
6994: believe that it is only the _effect_ of these vibrations upon the
6995: elastic parts of our body that is felt, but that the _time interval_
6996: between them is not remarked or brought into judgement; and thus that
6997: only pleasantness and not beauty of composition is bound up with
6998: colours and tones. But on the other hand, _first_, we think of the
6999: mathematical [element] which enables us to pronounce on the proportion
7000: between these oscillations in music and thus to judge of them; and by
7001: analogy with which we easily may judge of the distinctions between
7002: colours. _Secondly_, we recall instances (although they are rare) of
7003: men who with the best sight in the world cannot distinguish colours,
7004: and with the sharpest hearing cannot distinguish tones; whilst for
7005: those who can do this the perception of an altered quality (not merely
7006: of the degree of sensation) in the different intensities in the scale
7007: of colours and tones is definite; and further, the very number of these
7008: is fixed by _intelligible_ differences. Thus we may be compelled to see
7009: that both kinds of sensations are to be regarded not as mere sensible
7010: impressions, but as the effects of a judgement passed upon the form
7011: in the play of divers sensations. The difference in our definition,
7012: according as we adopt the one or the other opinion in judging of the
7013: grounds of Music, would be just this: either, as we have done, we
7014: must explain it as the beautiful play of sensations (of hearing), or
7015: else as a play of _pleasant_ sensations. According to the former mode
7016: of explanation music is represented altogether as a _beautiful_ art;
7017: according to the latter, as a _pleasant_ art (at least in part).
7018: 
7019: 
7020: § 52. _Of the combination of beautiful arts in one and the same product_
7021: 
7022: Rhetoric may be combined with a pictorial presentation of its subjects
7023: and objects in a _theatrical piece_; poetry may be combined with music
7024: in a _song_, and this again with pictorial (theatrical) presentation in
7025: an _opera_; the play of sensations in music may be combined with the
7026: play of figures in the _dance_, and so on. Even the presentation of
7027: the sublime, so far as it belongs to beautiful art, may combine with
7028: beauty in a _tragedy in verse_, in a _didactic poem_, in an _oratorio_;
7029: and in these combinations beautiful art is yet more artistic. Whether
7030: it is also more beautiful may in some of these cases be doubted (since
7031: so many different kinds of satisfaction cross one another). Yet in
7032: all beautiful art the essential thing is the form, which is purposive
7033: as regards our observation and judgement, where the pleasure is at
7034: the same time cultivation and disposes the spirit to Ideas, and
7035: consequently makes it susceptible of still more of such pleasure and
7036: entertainment. The essential element is not the matter of sensation
7037: (charm or emotion), which has only to do with enjoyment; this leaves
7038: behind nothing in the Idea, and it makes the spirit dull, the object
7039: gradually distasteful, and the mind, on account of its consciousness of
7040: a disposition that conflicts with purpose in the judgement of Reason,
7041: discontented with itself and peevish.
7042: 
7043: If the beautiful arts are not brought into more or less close
7044: combination with moral Ideas, which alone bring with them a
7045: self-sufficing satisfaction, this latter fate must ultimately be
7046: theirs. They then serve only as a distraction, of which we are the
7047: more in need the more we avail ourselves of them to disperse the
7048: discontent of the mind with itself; so that we thus render ourselves
7049: ever more useless and ever more discontented. The beauties of nature
7050: are generally of most benefit in this point of view, if we are early
7051: accustomed to observe, appreciate, and admire them.
7052: 
7053: 
7054: § 53. _Comparison of the respective aesthetical worth of the beautiful
7055: arts_
7056: 
7057: Of all the arts _poetry_ (which owes its origin almost entirely to
7058: genius and will least be guided by precept or example) maintains
7059: the first rank. It expands the mind by setting the Imagination at
7060: liberty; and by offering within the limits of a given concept amid
7061: the unbounded variety of possible forms accordant therewith, that
7062: which unites the presentment of this concept with a wealth of thought,
7063: to which no verbal expression is completely adequate; and so rising
7064: aesthetically to Ideas. It strengthens the mind by making it feel its
7065: faculty--free, spontaneous and independent of natural determination--of
7066: considering and judging nature as a phenomenon in accordance with
7067: aspects which it does not present in experience either for Sense or
7068: Understanding, and therefore of using it on behalf of, and as a sort
7069: of schema for, the supersensible. It plays with illusion, which it
7070: produces at pleasure, but without deceiving by it; for it declares
7071: its exercise to be mere play, which however can be purposively used
7072: by the Understanding.--Rhetoric, in so far as this means the art of
7073: persuasion, _i.e._ of deceiving by a beautiful show (_ars oratoria_),
7074: and not mere elegance of speech (eloquence and style), is a Dialectic,
7075: which borrows from poetry only so much as is needful to win minds
7076: to the side of the orator before they have formed a judgement, and
7077: to deprive them of their freedom; it cannot therefore be recommended
7078: either for the law courts or for the pulpit. For if we are dealing
7079: with civil law, with the rights of individual persons, or with lasting
7080: instruction and determination of people’s minds to an accurate
7081: knowledge and a conscientious observance of their duty, it is unworthy
7082: of so important a business to allow a trace of any exuberance of wit
7083: and imagination to appear, and still less any trace of the art of
7084: talking people over and of captivating them for the advantage of any
7085: chance person. For although this art may sometimes be directed to
7086: legitimate and praiseworthy designs, it becomes objectionable, when in
7087: this way maxims and dispositions are spoiled in a subjective point of
7088: view, though the action may objectively be lawful. It is not enough to
7089: do what is right; we should practise it solely on the ground that it
7090: is right. Again, the mere concept of this species of matters of human
7091: concern, when clear and combined with a lively presentation of it in
7092: examples, without any offence against the rules of euphony of speech
7093: or propriety of expression, has by itself for Ideas of Reason (which
7094: collectively constitute eloquence), sufficient influence upon human
7095: minds; so that it is not needful to add the machinery of persuasion,
7096: which, since it can be used equally well to beautify or to hide vice
7097: and error, cannot quite lull the secret suspicion that one is being
7098: artfully overreached. In poetry everything proceeds with honesty and
7099: candour. It declares itself to be a mere entertaining play of the
7100: Imagination, which wishes to proceed as regards form in harmony with
7101: the laws of the Understanding; and it does not desire to steal upon
7102: and ensnare the Understanding by the aid of sensible presentation.[92]
7103: 
7104: After poetry, _if we are to deal with charm and mental movement_, I
7105: would place that art which comes nearest to the art of speech and can
7106: very naturally be united with it, viz. _the art of tone_. For although
7107: it speaks by means of mere sensations without concepts, and so does
7108: not, like poetry, leave anything over for reflection, it yet moves
7109: the mind in a greater variety of ways and more intensely, although
7110: only transitorily. It is, however, rather enjoyment than culture (the
7111: play of thought that is incidentally excited by its means is merely
7112: the effect of a kind of mechanical association); and in the judgement
7113: of Reason it has less worth than any other of the beautiful arts.
7114: Hence, like all enjoyment, it desires constant change, and does not
7115: bear frequent repetition without producing weariness. Its charm, which
7116: admits of universal communication, appears to rest on this, that every
7117: expression of speech has in its context a tone appropriate to the
7118: sense. This tone indicates more or less an affection of the speaker,
7119: and produces it also in the hearer; which affection excites in its
7120: turn in the hearer the Idea that is expressed in speech by the tone
7121: in question. Thus as modulation is as it were a universal language of
7122: sensations intelligible to every man, the art of tone employs it by
7123: itself alone in its full force, viz. as a language of the affections,
7124: and thus communicates universally according to the laws of association
7125: the aesthetical Ideas naturally combined therewith. Now these
7126: aesthetical Ideas are not concepts or determinate thoughts. Hence the
7127: form of the composition of these sensations (harmony and melody) only
7128: serves instead of the form of language, by means of their proportionate
7129: accordance, to express the aesthetical Idea of a connected whole of an
7130: unspeakable wealth of thought, corresponding to a certain theme which
7131: produces the dominating affection in the piece. This can be brought
7132: mathematically under certain rules, because it rests in the case of
7133: tones on the relation between the number of vibrations of the air in
7134: the same time, so far as these tones are combined simultaneously or
7135: successively. To this mathematical form, although not represented by
7136: determinate concepts, alone attaches the satisfaction that unites
7137: the mere reflection upon such a number of concomitant or consecutive
7138: sensations with this their play, as a condition of its beauty valid for
7139: every man. It is this alone which permits Taste to claim in advance a
7140: rightful authority over every one’s judgement.
7141: 
7142: But in the charm and mental movement produced by Music, Mathematic
7143: has certainly not the slightest share. It is only the indispensable
7144: condition (_conditio sine qua non_) of that proportion of the
7145: impressions in their combination and in their alternation by which
7146: it becomes possible to gather them together and prevent them from
7147: destroying one another, and to harmonise them so as to produce a
7148: continual movement and animation of the mind, by means of affections
7149: consonant therewith, and thus a delightful personal enjoyment.
7150: 
7151: If, on the other hand, we estimate the worth of the Beautiful Arts
7152: by the culture they supply to the mind, and take as a standard
7153: the expansion of the faculties which must concur in the Judgement
7154: for cognition, Music will have the lowest place among them (as
7155: it has perhaps the highest among those arts which are valued for
7156: their pleasantness), because it merely plays with sensations. The
7157: formative arts are far before it in this point of view; for in putting
7158: the Imagination in a free play, which is also accordant with the
7159: Understanding, they at the same time carry on a serious business.
7160: This they do by producing a product that serves for concepts as a
7161: permanent self-commendatory vehicle for promoting their union with
7162: sensibility and thus, as it were, the urbanity of the higher cognitive
7163: powers. These two species of art take quite different courses; the
7164: first proceeds from sensations to indeterminate Ideas, the second
7165: from determinate Ideas to sensations. The latter produce _permanent_,
7166: the former only _transitory_ impressions. The Imagination can recall
7167: the one and entertain itself pleasantly therewith; but the other
7168: either vanish entirely, or if they are recalled involuntarily by the
7169: Imagination they are rather wearisome than pleasant.[93] Besides,
7170: there attaches to Music a certain want of urbanity from the fact
7171: that, chiefly from the character of its instruments, it extends its
7172: influence further than is desired (in the neighbourhood), and so as it
7173: were obtrudes itself, and does violence to the freedom of others who
7174: are not of the musical company. The Arts which appeal to the eyes do
7175: not do this; for we need only turn our eyes away, if we wish to avoid
7176: being impressed. The case of music is almost like that of the delight
7177: derived from a smell that diffuses itself widely. The man who pulls his
7178: perfumed handkerchief out of his pocket attracts the attention of all
7179: round him, even against their will, and he forces them, if they are to
7180: breathe at all, to enjoy the scent; hence this habit has gone out of
7181: fashion.[94]
7182: 
7183: Among the formative arts I would give the palm to painting; partly
7184: because as the art of delineation it lies at the root of all the other
7185: formative arts, and partly because it can penetrate much further
7186: into the region of Ideas, and can extend the field of intuition in
7187: conformity with them further than the others can.
7188: 
7189: 
7190: § 54. _Remark_
7191: 
7192: As we have often shown, there is an essential difference between _what
7193: satisfies simply in the act of judging it_, and that which _gratifies_
7194: (pleases in sensation). We cannot ascribe the latter to every one,
7195: as we can the former. Gratification (the causes of which may even
7196: be situate in Ideas) appears always to consist in a feeling of the
7197: furtherance of the whole life of the man, and consequently, also of his
7198: bodily well-being, _i.e._ his health; so that _Epicurus_, who gave out
7199: that all gratification was at bottom bodily sensation, may, perhaps,
7200: not have been wrong, but only misunderstood himself when he reckoned
7201: intellectual and even practical satisfaction under gratification. If we
7202: have this distinction in view we can explain how a gratification may
7203: dissatisfy the man who sensibly feels it (_e.g._ the joy of a needy but
7204: well-meaning man at becoming the heir of an affectionate but penurious
7205: father); or how a deep grief may satisfy the person experiencing it
7206: (the sorrow of a widow at the death of her excellent husband); or how
7207: a gratification can in addition satisfy (as in the sciences that we
7208: pursue); or how a grief (_e.g._ hatred, envy, revenge) can moreover
7209: dissatisfy. The satisfaction or dissatisfaction here depends on Reason,
7210: and is the same as _approbation_ or _disapprobation_; but gratification
7211: and grief can only rest on the feeling or prospect of a possible (on
7212: whatever grounds) _well-being_ or _its opposite_.
7213: 
7214: All changing free play of sensations (that have no design at their
7215: basis) gratifies, because it promotes the feeling of health. In the
7216: judgement of Reason we may or may not have any satisfaction in its
7217: object or even in this gratification; and this latter may rise to the
7218: height of an affection, although we take no interest in the object,
7219: at least none that is proportionate to the degree of the affection.
7220: We may subdivide this free play of sensations into the _play of
7221: fortune_ [games of chance], the _play of tone_ [music], and the _play
7222: of thought_ [wit]. The _first_ requires an _interest_, whether of
7223: vanity or of selfishness; which, however, is not nearly so great as the
7224: interest that attaches to the way in which we are striving to procure
7225: it. The _second_ requires merely the change of _sensations_, all of
7226: which have a relation to affection, though they have not the degree of
7227: affection, and excite aesthetical Ideas. The _third_ springs merely
7228: from the change of representations in the Judgement; by it, indeed, no
7229: thought that brings an interest with it is produced, but yet the mind
7230: is animated thereby.
7231: 
7232: How much gratification games must afford, without any necessity of
7233: placing at their basis an interested design, all our evening parties
7234: show; for hardly any of them can be carried on without a game. But the
7235: affections of hope, fear, joy, wrath, scorn, are put in play by them,
7236: alternating every moment; and they are so vivid that by them, as by
7237: a kind of internal motion, all the vital processes of the body seem
7238: to be promoted, as is shown by the mental vivacity excited by them,
7239: although nothing is gained or learnt thereby. But as the beautiful does
7240: not enter into games of chance, we will here set them aside. On the
7241: other hand, music and that which excites laughter are two different
7242: kinds of play with aesthetical Ideas, or with representations of the
7243: Understanding through which ultimately nothing is thought; and yet
7244: they can give lively gratification merely by their changes. Thus we
7245: recognise pretty clearly that the animation in both cases is merely
7246: bodily, although it is excited by Ideas of the mind; and that the
7247: feeling of health produced by a motion of the intestines corresponding
7248: to the play in question makes up that whole gratification of a gay
7249: party, which is regarded as so refined and so spiritual. It is not the
7250: judging the harmony in tones or sallies of wit,--which serves only
7251: in combination with their beauty as a necessary vehicle,--but the
7252: furtherance of the vital bodily processes, the affection that moves
7253: the intestines and the diaphragm, in a word, the feeling of health
7254: (which without such inducements one does not feel) that makes up the
7255: gratification felt by us; so that we can thus reach the body through
7256: the soul and use the latter as the physician of the former.
7257: 
7258: In music this play proceeds from bodily sensations to aesthetical Ideas
7259: (the Objects of our affections), and then from these back again to the
7260: body with redoubled force. In the case of jokes (the art of which,
7261: just like music, should rather be reckoned as pleasant than beautiful)
7262: the play begins with the thoughts which together occupy the body, so
7263: far as they admit of sensible expression; and as the Understanding
7264: stops suddenly short at this presentment, in which it does not find
7265: what it expected, we feel the effect of this slackening in the body
7266: by the oscillation of the organs, which promotes the restoration of
7267: equilibrium and has a favourable influence upon health.
7268: 
7269: In everything that is to excite a lively convulsive laugh there must
7270: be something absurd (in which the Understanding, therefore, can find
7271: no satisfaction). _Laughter is an affection arising from the sudden
7272: transformation of a strained expectation into nothing._[95] This
7273: transformation, which is certainly not enjoyable by the Understanding,
7274: yet indirectly gives it very active enjoyment for a moment. Therefore
7275: its cause must consist in the influence of the representation upon the
7276: body, and the reflex effect of this upon the mind; not, indeed, through
7277: the representation being objectively an object of gratification[96]
7278: (for how could a delusive expectation gratify?), but simply through it
7279: as a mere play of representations bringing about an equilibrium of the
7280: vital powers in the body.
7281: 
7282: Suppose this story to be told: An Indian at the table of an Englishman
7283: in Surat, when he saw a bottle of ale opened and all the beer turned
7284: into froth and overflowing, testified his great astonishment with many
7285: exclamations. When the Englishman asked him, “What is there in this
7286: to astonish you so much?” he answered, “I am not at all astonished
7287: that it should flow out, but I do wonder how you ever got it in.” At
7288: this story we laugh, and it gives us hearty pleasure; not because
7289: we deem ourselves cleverer than this ignorant man, or because of
7290: anything else in it that we note as satisfactory to the Understanding,
7291: but because our expectation was strained [for a time] and then was
7292: suddenly dissipated into nothing. Again: The heir of a rich relative
7293: wished to arrange for an imposing funeral, but he lamented that he
7294: could not properly succeed; “for” (said he) “the more money I give
7295: my mourners to look sad, the more cheerful they look!”[97] When we
7296: hear this story we laugh loud, and the reason is that an expectation
7297: is suddenly transformed into nothing. We must note well that it
7298: does not transform itself into the positive opposite of an expected
7299: object--for then there would still be something, which might even be
7300: a cause of grief--but it must be transformed into nothing. For if a
7301: man arouses great expectations in us when telling a story, and at the
7302: end we see its falsehood immediately, it displeases us; _e.g._ the
7303: story of the people whose hair in consequence of great grief turned
7304: gray in one night. But if a wag, to repair the effect of this story,
7305: describes very circumstantially the grief of the merchant returning
7306: from India to Europe with all his wealth in merchandise who was forced
7307: to throw it overboard in a heavy storm, and who grieved thereat so
7308: much that his _wig_ turned gray the same night--we laugh and it gives
7309: us gratification. For we treat our own mistake in the case of an
7310: object otherwise indifferent to us, or rather the Idea which we are
7311: following out, as we treat a ball which we knock to and fro for a
7312: time, though our only serious intention is to seize it and hold it
7313: fast. It is not the mere rebuff of a liar or a simpleton that arouses
7314: our gratification; for the latter story told with assumed seriousness
7315: would set a whole company in a roar of laughter, while the former would
7316: ordinarily not be regarded as worth attending to.
7317: 
7318: It is remarkable that in all such cases the jest must contain something
7319: that is capable of deceiving for a moment. Hence, when the illusion is
7320: dissipated, the mind turns back to try it once again, and thus through
7321: a rapidly alternating tension and relaxation it is jerked back and
7322: put into a state of oscillation. This, because the strain on the cord
7323: as it were is suddenly (and not gradually) relaxed, must occasion a
7324: mental movement, and an inner bodily movement harmonising therewith,
7325: which continues involuntarily and fatigues, even while cheering us (the
7326: effects of a motion conducive to health).
7327: 
7328: For if we admit that with all our thoughts is harmonically combined
7329: a movement in the organs of the body, we shall easily comprehend how
7330: to this sudden transposition of the mind, now to one now to another
7331: standpoint in order to contemplate its object, may correspond an
7332: alternating tension and relaxation of the elastic portions of our
7333: intestines, which communicates itself to the diaphragm (like that which
7334: ticklish people feel). In connexion with this the lungs expel the
7335: air at rapidly succeeding intervals, and thus bring about a movement
7336: beneficial to health; which alone, and not what precedes it in the
7337: mind, is the proper cause of the gratification in a thought that at
7338: bottom represents nothing.--_Voltaire_ said that heaven had given us
7339: two things to counterbalance the many miseries of life, _hope_ and
7340: _sleep_.[98] He could have added _laughter_, if the means of exciting
7341: it in reasonable men were only as easily attainable, and the requisite
7342: wit or originality of humour were not so rare, as the talent is common
7343: of imagining things which _break one’s head_, as mystic dreamers do, or
7344: which _break one’s neck_, as your genius does, or which _break one’s
7345: heart_, as sentimental romance-writers (and even moralists of the same
7346: kidney) do.
7347: 
7348: We may therefore, as it seems to me, readily concede to _Epicurus_
7349: that all gratification, even that which is occasioned through concepts,
7350: excited by aesthetical Ideas, is _animal_, _i.e._ bodily sensation;
7351: without the least prejudice to the _spiritual_ feeling of respect for
7352: moral Ideas, which is not gratification at all but an esteem for self
7353: (for humanity in us), that raises us above the need of gratification,
7354: and even without the slightest prejudice to the less noble [feeling] of
7355: _taste_.
7356: 
7357: We find a combination of these two last in _naiveté_, which is the
7358: breaking out of the sincerity originally natural to humanity in
7359: opposition to that art of dissimulation which has become a second
7360: nature. We laugh at the simplicity that does not understand how
7361: to dissemble; and yet we are delighted with the simplicity of the
7362: nature which thwarts that art. We look for the commonplace manner of
7363: artificial utterance devised with foresight to make a fair show; and
7364: behold! it is the unspoiled innocent nature which we do not expect to
7365: find, and which he who displays it did not think of disclosing. That
7366: the fair but false show which generally has so much influence upon
7367: our judgement is here suddenly transformed into nothing, so that, as
7368: it were, the rogue in us is laid bare, produces a movement of the
7369: mind in two opposite directions, which gives a wholesome shock to the
7370: body. But the fact that something infinitely better than all assumed
7371: manner, viz. purity of disposition (or at least the tendency thereto),
7372: is not quite extinguished yet in human nature, blends seriousness and
7373: high esteem with this play of the Judgement. But because it is only
7374: a transitory phenomenon and the veil of dissimulation is soon drawn
7375: over it again, there is mingled therewith a compassion which is an
7376: emotion of tenderness; this, as play, readily admits of combination
7377: with a good-hearted laugh, and ordinarily is actually so combined, and
7378: withal is wont to compensate him who supplies its material for the
7379: embarrassment which results from not yet being wise after the manner
7380: of men.--An art that is to be _naive_ is thus a contradiction; but the
7381: representation of naiveté in a fictitious personage is quite possible,
7382: and is a beautiful though a rare art. Naiveté must not be confounded
7383: with open-hearted simplicity, which does not artificially spoil nature
7384: solely because it does not understand the art of social intercourse.
7385: 
7386: The _humorous_ manner again may be classified as that which, as
7387: exhilarating us, is near akin to the gratification that proceeds
7388: from laughter; and belongs to the originality of spirit, but not to
7389: the talent of beautiful art. _Humour_ in the good sense means the
7390: talent of being able voluntarily to put oneself into a certain mental
7391: disposition, in which everything is judged quite differently from the
7392: ordinary method (reversed, in fact), and yet in accordance with certain
7393: rational principles in such a frame of mind. He who is involuntarily
7394: subject to such mutations is called _a man of humours_ [launisch]; but
7395: he who can assume them voluntarily and purposively (on behalf of a
7396: lively presentment brought about by the aid of a contrast that excites
7397: a laugh)--he and his manner of speech are called _humorous_ [launigt].
7398: This manner, however, belongs rather to pleasant than to beautiful art,
7399: because the object of the latter must always exhibit intrinsic worth,
7400: and hence requires a certain seriousness in the presentation, as taste
7401: does in the act of judgement.
7402:

7404: 
7405: 
7406: SECOND DIVISION
7407: 
7408: DIALECTIC OF THE AESTHETICAL JUDGEMENT
7409: 
7410: 
7411: § 55
7412: 
7413: A faculty of Judgement that is to be dialectical must in the
7414: first place be rationalising, _i.e._ its judgements must claim
7415: universality[99] and that _a priori_; for it is in the opposition of
7416: such judgements that Dialectic consists. Hence the incompatibility of
7417: aesthetical judgements of Sense (about the pleasant and the unpleasant)
7418: is not dialectical. And again, the conflict between judgements of
7419: Taste, so far as each man depends merely on his own taste, forms no
7420: Dialectic of taste; because no one proposes to make his own judgement a
7421: universal rule. There remains therefore no other concept of a Dialectic
7422: which has to do with taste than that of a Dialectic of the _Critique_
7423: of taste (not of taste itself) in respect of its _principles_; for
7424: here concepts that contradict one another (as to the ground of
7425: the possibility of judgements of taste in general) naturally and
7426: unavoidably present themselves. The transcendental Critique of taste
7427: will therefore contain a part which can bear the name of a Dialectic
7428: of the aesthetical Judgement, only if and so far as there is found an
7429: antinomy of the principles of this faculty which renders its conformity
7430: to law, and consequently also its internal possibility, doubtful.
7431: 
7432: 
7433: § 56. _Representation of the antinomy of Taste_
7434: 
7435: The first commonplace of taste is contained in the proposition, with
7436: which every tasteless person proposes to avoid blame: _every one has
7437: his own taste_. That is as much as to say that the determining ground
7438: of this judgement is merely subjective (gratification or grief), and
7439: that the judgement has no right to the necessary assent of others.
7440: 
7441: The second commonplace invoked even by those who admit for judgements
7442: of taste the right to speak with validity for every one is: _there
7443: is no disputing about taste_. That is as much as to say that the
7444: determining ground of a judgement of taste may indeed be objective, but
7445: that it cannot be reduced to definite concepts, and that consequently
7446: about the judgement itself nothing can be _decided_ by proofs, although
7447: much may rightly be _contested_. For _contesting_ [quarrelling] and
7448: _disputing_ [controversy] are doubtless the same in this, that by means
7449: of the mutual opposition of judgements they seek to produce their
7450: accordance; but different in that the latter hopes to bring this about
7451: according to definite concepts as determining grounds, and consequently
7452: assumes _objective concepts_ as grounds of the judgement. But where
7453: this is regarded as impracticable, controversy is regarded as alike
7454: impracticable.
7455: 
7456: We easily see that between these two commonplaces there is a
7457: proposition wanting, which, though it has not passed into a proverb,
7458: is yet familiar to every one, viz. _there may be a quarrel about
7459: taste_ (although there can be no controversy). But this proposition
7460: involves the contradictory of the former one. For wherever quarrelling
7461: is permissible, there must be a hope of mutual reconciliation; and
7462: consequently we can count on grounds of our judgement that have not
7463: merely private validity, and therefore are not merely subjective. And
7464: to this the proposition, _every one has his own taste_, is directly
7465: opposed.
7466: 
7467: There emerges therefore in respect of the principle of taste the
7468: following Antinomy:--
7469: 
7470: (1) _Thesis._ The judgement of taste is not based upon concepts; for
7471: otherwise it would admit of controversy (would be determinable by
7472: proofs).
7473: 
7474: (2) _Antithesis._ The judgement of taste is based on concepts; for
7475: otherwise, despite its diversity, we could not quarrel about it (we
7476: could not claim for our judgement the necessary assent of others).
7477: 
7478: 
7479: § 57. _Solution of the antinomy of Taste_
7480: 
7481: There is no possibility of removing the conflict between these
7482: principles that underlie every judgement of taste (which are nothing
7483: else than the two peculiarities of the judgement of taste exhibited
7484: above in the Analytic), except by showing that the concept to which we
7485: refer the Object in this kind of judgement is not taken in the same
7486: sense in both maxims of the aesthetical Judgement. This twofold sense
7487: or twofold point of view is necessary to our transcendental Judgement;
7488: but also the illusion which arises from the confusion of one with the
7489: other is natural and unavoidable.
7490: 
7491: The judgement of taste must refer to some concept; otherwise it could
7492: make absolutely no claim to be necessarily valid for every one. But
7493: it is not therefore capable of being proved _from_ a concept; because
7494: a concept may be either determinable or in itself undetermined and
7495: undeterminable. The concepts of the Understanding are of the former
7496: kind; they are determinable through predicates of sensible intuition
7497: which can correspond to them. But the transcendental rational concept
7498: of the supersensible, which lies at the basis of all sensible
7499: intuition, is of the latter kind, and therefore cannot be theoretically
7500: determined further.
7501: 
7502: Now the judgement of taste is applied to objects of Sense, but not with
7503: a view of determining a _concept_ of them for the Understanding; for
7504: it is not a cognitive judgement. It is thus only a private judgement,
7505: in which a singular representation intuitively perceived is referred
7506: to the feeling of pleasure; and so far would be limited as regards its
7507: validity to the individual judging. The object is _for me_ an object of
7508: satisfaction; by others it may be regarded quite differently--every one
7509: has his own taste.
7510: 
7511: Nevertheless there is undoubtedly contained in the judgement of taste
7512: a wider reference of the representation of the Object (as well as of
7513: the subject), whereon we base an extension of judgements of this kind
7514: as necessary for every one. At the basis of this there must necessarily
7515: be a concept somewhere; though a concept which cannot be determined
7516: through intuition. But through a concept of this sort we know nothing,
7517: and consequently it can _supply no proof_ for the judgement of taste.
7518: Such a concept is the mere pure rational concept of the supersensible
7519: which underlies the object (and also the subject judging it), regarded
7520: as an Object of sense and thus as phenomenon.[100] For if we do
7521: not admit such a reference, the claim of the judgement of taste to
7522: universal validity would not hold good. If the concept on which it is
7523: based were only a mere confused concept of the Understanding, like that
7524: of perfection, with which we could bring the sensible intuition of the
7525: Beautiful into correspondence, it would be at least possible in itself
7526: to base the judgement of taste on proofs; which contradicts the thesis.
7527: 
7528: But all contradiction disappears if I say: the judgement of taste is
7529: based on a concept (viz. the concept of the general ground of the
7530: subjective purposiveness of nature for the Judgement); from which,
7531: however, nothing can be known and proved in respect of the Object,
7532: because it is in itself undeterminable and useless for knowledge. Yet
7533: at the same time and on that very account the judgement has validity
7534: for every one (though of course for each only as a singular judgement
7535: immediately accompanying his intuition); because its determining ground
7536: lies perhaps in the concept of that which may be regarded as the
7537: supersensible substrate of humanity.
7538: 
7539: The solution of an antinomy only depends on the possibility of showing
7540: that two apparently contradictory propositions do not contradict
7541: one another in fact, but that they may be consistent; although the
7542: explanation of the possibility of their concept may transcend our
7543: cognitive faculties. That this illusion is natural and unavoidable
7544: by human Reason, and also why it is so, and remains so, although it
7545: ceases to deceive after the analysis of the apparent contradiction, may
7546: be thus explained.
7547: 
7548: In the two contradictory judgements we take the concept, on which the
7549: universal validity of a judgement must be based, in the same sense; and
7550: yet we apply to it two opposite predicates. In the Thesis we mean that
7551: the judgement of taste is not based upon _determinate_ concepts; and
7552: in the Antithesis that the judgement of taste is based upon a concept,
7553: but an _indeterminate_ one (viz. of the supersensible substrate of
7554: phenomena). Between these two there is no contradiction.
7555: 
7556: We can do nothing more than remove this conflict between the claims and
7557: counter-claims of taste. It is absolutely impossible to give a definite
7558: objective principle of taste, in accordance with which its judgements
7559: could be derived, examined, and established; for then the judgement
7560: would not be one of taste at all. The subjective principle, viz. the
7561: indefinite Idea of the supersensible in us, can only be put forward as
7562: the sole key to the puzzle of this faculty whose sources are hidden
7563: from us: it can be made no further intelligible.
7564: 
7565: The proper concept of taste, that is of a merely reflective aesthetical
7566: Judgement, lies at the basis of the antinomy here exhibited and
7567: adjusted. Thus the two apparently contradictory principles are
7568: reconciled--_both can be true_; which is sufficient. If, on the other
7569: hand, we assume, as some do, _pleasantness_ as the determining ground
7570: of taste (on account of the singularity of the representation which
7571: lies at the basis of the judgement of taste), or, as others will
7572: have it, the principle of perfection (on account of the universality
7573: of the same), and settle the definition of taste accordingly; then
7574: there arises an antinomy which it is absolutely impossible to adjust
7575: except by showing that _both_ the contrary (though not contradictory)
7576: _propositions are false_. And this would prove that the concept on
7577: which they are based is self-contradictory. Hence we see that the
7578: removal of the antinomy of the aesthetical Judgement takes a course
7579: similar to that pursued by the Critique in the solution of the
7580: antinomies of pure theoretical Reason. And thus here, as also in the
7581: Critique of practical Reason, the antinomies force us against our will
7582: to look beyond the sensible and to seek in the supersensible the point
7583: of union for all our _a priori_ faculties; because no other expedient
7584: is left to make our Reason harmonious with itself.
7585: 
7586: 
7587: _Remark I._
7588: 
7589: As we so often find occasion in Transcendental Philosophy for
7590: distinguishing Ideas from concepts of the Understanding, it may be of
7591: use to introduce technical terms to correspond to this distinction.
7592: I believe that no one will object if I propose some.--In the most
7593: universal signification of the word, Ideas are representations referred
7594: to an object, according to a certain (subjective or objective)
7595: principle, but so that they can never become a cognition of it.
7596: They are either referred to an intuition, according to a merely
7597: subjective principle of the mutual harmony of the cognitive powers
7598: (the Imagination and the Understanding), and they are then called
7599: _aesthetical_; or they are referred to a concept according to an
7600: objective principle, although they can never furnish a cognition of
7601: the object and are called _rational Ideas_. In the latter case the
7602: concept is a _transcendent_ one, which is different from a concept of
7603: the Understanding, to which an adequately corresponding experience can
7604: always be supplied, and which therefore is called _immanent_.
7605: 
7606: An _aesthetical Idea_ cannot become a cognition, because it is an
7607: _intuition_ (of the Imagination) for which an adequate concept can
7608: never be found. A _rational Idea_ can never become a cognition, because
7609: it involves a concept (of the supersensible), corresponding to which an
7610: intuition can never be given.
7611: 
7612: Now I believe we might call the aesthetical Idea an _inexponible_
7613: representation of the Imagination, and a rational Idea an
7614: _indemonstrable_ concept of Reason. It is assumed of both that they are
7615: not generated without grounds, but (according to the above explanation
7616: of an Idea in general) in conformity with certain principles of the
7617: cognitive faculties to which they belong (subjective principles in the
7618: one case, objective in the other).
7619: 
7620: _Concepts of the Understanding_ must, as such, always be demonstrable
7621: [if by demonstration we understand, as in anatomy, merely
7622: _presentation_];[101] _i.e._ the object corresponding to them must
7623: always be capable of being given in intuition (pure or empirical); for
7624: thus alone could they become cognitions. The concept of _magnitude_
7625: can be given _a priori_ in the intuition of space, _e.g._ of a right
7626: line, etc.; the concept of _cause_ in impenetrability, in the collision
7627: of bodies, etc. Consequently both can be authenticated by means of
7628: an empirical intuition, _i.e._ the thought of them can be proved
7629: (demonstrated, verified) by an example; and this must be possible,
7630: for otherwise we should not be certain that the concept was not empty,
7631: _i.e._ devoid of any _Object_.
7632: 
7633: In Logic we ordinarily use the expressions demonstrable or
7634: indemonstrable only in respect of _propositions_, but these might
7635: be better designated by the titles respectively of _mediately and
7636: immediately certain_ propositions; for pure Philosophy has also
7637: propositions of both kinds, _i.e._ true propositions, some of which
7638: are susceptible of proof and others not. It can, as philosophy, prove
7639: them on _a priori_ grounds, but it cannot demonstrate them; unless
7640: we wish to depart entirely from the proper meaning of this word,
7641: according to which _to demonstrate_ (_ostendere_, _exhibere_) is
7642: equivalent to presenting a concept in intuition (whether in proof or
7643: merely in definition). If the intuition is _a priori_ this is called
7644: construction; but if it is empirical, then the Object is displayed by
7645: means of which objective reality is assured to the concept. Thus we say
7646: of an anatomist that he demonstrates the human eye, if by a dissection
7647: of this organ he makes intuitively evident the concept which he has
7648: previously treated discursively.
7649: 
7650: It hence follows that the rational concept of the supersensible
7651: substrate of all phenomena in general, or even of that which must be
7652: placed at the basis of our arbitrary will in respect of the moral law,
7653: viz. of transcendental freedom, is already, in kind, an indemonstrable
7654: concept and a rational Idea; while virtue is so, in degree. For there
7655: can be given in experience, as regards its quality, absolutely nothing
7656: corresponding to the former; whereas in the latter case no empirical
7657: product attains to the degree of that causality, which the rational
7658: Idea prescribes as the rule.
7659: 
7660: As in a rational Idea the _Imagination_ with its intuitions does
7661: not attain to the given concept, so in an aesthetical Idea the
7662: _Understanding_ by its concepts never attains completely to that
7663: internal intuition which the Imagination binds up with a given
7664: representation. Since, now, to reduce a representation of the
7665: Imagination to concepts is the same thing as to _expound_ it, the
7666: aesthetical Idea may be called an _inexponible_ representation of the
7667: Imagination (in its free play). I shall have occasion in the sequel to
7668: say something more of Ideas of this kind; now I only note that both
7669: kinds of Ideas, rational and aesthetical, must have their principles;
7670: and must have them in Reason--the one in the objective, the other in
7671: the subjective principles of its employment.
7672: 
7673: We can consequently explain _genius_ as the faculty of _aesthetical
7674: Ideas_; by which at the same time is shown the reason why in the
7675: products of genius it is the nature (of the subject) and not a
7676: premeditated purpose that gives the rule to the art (of the production
7677: of the beautiful). For since the beautiful must not be judged by
7678: concepts, but by the purposive attuning of the Imagination to agreement
7679: with the faculty of concepts in general, it cannot be rule and precept
7680: which can serve as the subjective standard of that aesthetical but
7681: unconditioned purposiveness in beautiful art, that can rightly claim
7682: to please every one. It can only be that in the subject which is
7683: nature and cannot be brought under rules or concepts, _i.e._ the
7684: supersensible substrate of all his faculties (to which no concept of
7685: the Understanding extends), and consequently that with respect to which
7686: it is the final purpose given by the intelligible [part] of our nature
7687: to harmonise all our cognitive faculties. Thus alone is it possible
7688: that there should be _a priori_ at the basis of this purposiveness, for
7689: which we can prescribe no objective principle, a principle subjective
7690: and yet of universal validity.
7691: 
7692: 
7693: _Remark II._
7694: 
7695: The following important remark occurs here: There are _three kinds of
7696: Antinomies_ of pure Reason, which, however, all agree in this, that
7697: they compel us to give up the otherwise very natural hypothesis that
7698: objects of sense are things in themselves, and force us to regard them
7699: merely as phenomena, and to supply to them an intelligible substrate
7700: (something supersensible of which the concept is only an Idea, and
7701: supplies no proper knowledge). Without such antinomies Reason could
7702: never decide upon accepting a principle narrowing so much the field of
7703: its speculation, and could never bring itself to sacrifices by which so
7704: many otherwise brilliant hopes must disappear. For even now when, by
7705: way of compensation for these losses, a greater field in a practical
7706: aspect opens out before it, it appears not to be able without grief to
7707: part from those hopes, and disengage itself from its old attachment.
7708: 
7709: That there are three kinds of antinomies has its ground in this, that
7710: there are three cognitive faculties,--Understanding, Judgement, and
7711: Reason; of which each (as a superior cognitive faculty) must have
7712: its _a priori_ principles. For Reason, in so far as it judges of
7713: these principles and their use, inexorably requires, in respect of
7714: them all, the unconditioned for the given conditioned; and this can
7715: never be found if we consider the sensible as belonging to things
7716: in themselves, and do not rather supply to it, as mere phenomenon,
7717: something supersensible (the intelligible substrate of nature both
7718: external and internal) as the reality in itself [Sache an sich selbst].
7719: There are then: (1) _For the cognitive faculty_ an antinomy of Reason
7720: in respect of the theoretical employment of the Understanding extended
7721: to the unconditioned; (2) _for the feeling of pleasure and pain_ an
7722: antinomy of Reason in respect of the aesthetical employment of the
7723: Judgement; and (3) _for the faculty of desire_ an antinomy in respect
7724: of the practical employment of the self-legislative Reason; so far as
7725: all these faculties have their superior principles _a priori_, and, in
7726: conformity with an inevitable requirement of Reason, must judge and be
7727: able to determine their Object, _unconditionally_ according to those
7728: principles.
7729: 
7730: As for the two antinomies of the theoretical and practical employment
7731: of the superior cognitive faculties, we have already shown their
7732: _unavoidableness_, if judgements of this kind are not referred to
7733: a supersensible substrate of the given Objects, as phenomena; and
7734: also the _possibility of their solution_, as soon as this is done.
7735: And as for the antinomies in the employment of the Judgement, in
7736: conformity with the requirements of Reason, and their solution which
7737: is here given, there are only two ways of avoiding them. _Either_:
7738: we must deny that any _a priori_ principle lies at the basis of the
7739: aesthetical judgement of taste; we must maintain that all claim to
7740: necessary universal agreement is a groundless and vain fancy, and that
7741: a judgement of taste only deserves to be regarded as correct because
7742: _it happens_ that many people agree about it; and this, not because we
7743: _assume_ an _a priori_ principle behind this agreement, but because
7744: (as in the taste of the palate) of the contingent similar organisation
7745: of the different subjects. _Or_: we must assume that the judgement of
7746: taste is really a disguised judgement of Reason upon the perfection
7747: discovered in a thing and the reference of the manifold in it to a
7748: purpose, and is consequently only called aesthetical on account of the
7749: confusion here attaching to our reflection, although it is at bottom
7750: teleological. In the latter case we could declare the solution of the
7751: antinomies by means of transcendental Ideas to be needless and without
7752: point, and thus could harmonise these laws of taste with Objects of
7753: sense, not as mere phenomena but as things in themselves. But we have
7754: shown in several places in the exposition of judgements of taste how
7755: little either of these expedients will satisfy.
7756: 
7757: However, if it be granted that our deduction at least proceeds by the
7758: right method, although it be not yet plain enough in all its parts,
7759: three Ideas manifest themselves. _First_, there is the Idea of the
7760: supersensible in general, without any further determination of it, as
7761: the substrate of nature. _Secondly_, there is the Idea of the same
7762: as the principle of the subjective purposiveness of nature for our
7763: cognitive faculty. And _thirdly_, there is the Idea of the same as the
7764: principle of the purposes of freedom, and of the agreement of freedom
7765: with its purposes in the moral sphere.
7766: 
7767: 
7768: § 58. _Of the Idealism of the purposiveness of both Nature and Art as
7769: the unique principle of the aesthetical Judgement_
7770: 
7771: To begin with, we can either place the principle of taste in the fact
7772: that it always judges in accordance with grounds which are empirical
7773: and therefore are only given _a posteriori_ by sense, or concede that
7774: it judges on _a priori_ grounds. The former would be the _empiricism_
7775: of the Critique of Taste; the latter its _rationalism_. According to
7776: the _former_ the Object of our satisfaction would not differ from
7777: the _pleasant_; according to the latter, if the judgement rests on
7778: definite concepts, it would not differ from the _good_. Thus all
7779: _beauty_ would be banished from the world, and only a particular name,
7780: expressing perhaps a certain mingling of the two above-named kinds of
7781: satisfaction, would remain in its place. But we have shown that there
7782: are also _a priori_ grounds of satisfaction which can subsist along
7783: with the principle of rationalism, although they cannot be comprehended
7784: in _definite concepts_.
7785: 
7786: On the other hand, the rationalism of the principle of taste is either
7787: that of the _realism_ of the purposiveness, or of its _idealism_.
7788: Because a judgement of taste is not a cognitive judgement, and beauty
7789: is not a characteristic of the Object, considered in itself, the
7790: rationalism of the principle of taste can never be placed in the fact
7791: that the purposiveness in this judgement is thought as objective,
7792: _i.e._ that the judgement theoretically, and therefore also logically
7793: (although only in a confused way), refers to the perfection of the
7794: Object. It only refers _aesthetically_ to the agreement of the
7795: representation of the Object in the Imagination with the essential
7796: principles of Judgement in general in the subject. Consequently, even
7797: according to the principle of rationalism, the judgement of taste
7798: and the distinction between its realism and idealism can only be
7799: settled thus. Either in the first case, this subjective purposiveness
7800: is assumed as an actual (designed) _purpose_ of nature (or art)
7801: harmonising with our Judgement; or, in the second case, as a purposive
7802: harmony with the needs of Judgement, in respect of nature and its forms
7803: produced according to particular laws, which shows itself, without
7804: purpose, spontaneously, and contingently.
7805: 
7806: The beautiful formations in the kingdom of organised nature speak
7807: loudly for the realism of the aesthetical purposiveness of nature;
7808: since we might assume that behind the production of the beautiful there
7809: is an Idea of the beautiful in the producing cause, viz. a _purpose_
7810: in respect of our Imagination. Flowers, blossoms, even the shapes
7811: of entire plants; the elegance of animal formations of all kinds,
7812: unneeded for their proper use, but, as it were, selected for our taste;
7813: especially the charming variety so satisfying to the eye and the
7814: harmonious arrangement of colours (in the pheasant, in shell-fish, in
7815: insects, even in the commonest flowers), which, as it only concerns the
7816: surface and not the figure of these creations (though perhaps requisite
7817: in regard of their internal purposes), seems to be entirely designed
7818: for external inspection; these things give great weight to that mode of
7819: explanation which assumes actual purposes of nature for our aesthetical
7820: Judgement.
7821: 
7822: On the other hand, not only is Reason opposed to this assumption in
7823: its maxims, which bid us always avoid as far as possible unnecessary
7824: multiplication of principles; but nature everywhere shows in its
7825: free formations much mechanical tendency to the productions of forms
7826: which seem, as it were, to be made for the aesthetical exercise of
7827: our Judgement, without affording the least ground for the supposition
7828: that there is need of anything more than its mechanism, merely as
7829: nature, according to which, without any Idea lying at their root,
7830: they can be purposive for our judgement. But I understand by _free
7831: formations_ of nature _those_ whereby from a _fluid at rest_, through
7832: the volatilisation or separation of a portion of its constituents
7833: (sometimes merely of caloric), the remainder in becoming solid
7834: assumes a definite shape or tissue (figure or texture), which is
7835: different according to the specific difference of the material, but
7836: in the same material is constant. Here it is always presupposed that
7837: we are speaking of a perfect fluid, _i.e._ that the material in it
7838: is completely dissolved, and that it is not a mere medley of solid
7839: particles in a state of suspension.
7840: 
7841: Formation, then, takes place by a _shooting together_, _i.e._ by a
7842: sudden solidification, not by a gradual transition from the fluid to
7843: the solid state, but all at once by a _saltus_; which transition is
7844: also called _crystallisation_. The commonest example of this kind of
7845: formation is the freezing of water, where first icicles are produced,
7846: which combine at angles of 60°, while others attach themselves to each
7847: vertex, until it all becomes ice; and so that, while this is going
7848: on, the water does not gradually become viscous, but is as perfectly
7849: fluid as if its temperature were far higher, although it is absolutely
7850: ice-cold. The matter that disengages itself, which is dissipated
7851: suddenly at the moment of solidification, is a considerable quantum
7852: of caloric, the disappearance of which, as it was only required for
7853: preserving fluidity, leaves the new ice not in the least colder than
7854: the water which shortly before was fluid.
7855: 
7856: Many salts, and also rocks, of a crystalline figure, are produced thus
7857: from a species of earth dissolved in water, we do not exactly know
7858: how. Thus are formed the glandular configurations of many minerals,
7859: the cubical sulphide of lead, the ruby silver ore, etc., in all
7860: probability in water and by the shooting together of particles, as they
7861: become forced by some cause to dispense with this vehicle and to unite
7862: in definite external shapes.
7863: 
7864: But also all kinds of matter, which have been kept in a fluid state
7865: by heat, and have become solid by cooling, show internally, when
7866: fractured, a definite texture. This makes us judge that if their own
7867: weight or the disturbance of the air had not prevented it, they would
7868: also have exhibited on the outer surface their specifically peculiar
7869: shapes. This has been observed in some metals on their inner surface,
7870: which have been hardened externally by fusion but are fluid in the
7871: interior, by the drawing off the internal fluid and the consequent
7872: undisturbed crystallisation of the remainder. Many of these mineral
7873: crystallisations, such as spars, hematite, arragonite, etc., often
7874: present beautiful shapes, the like of which art can only conceive; and
7875: the halo in the cavern of Antiparos[102] is merely produced by water
7876: trickling down strata of gypsum.
7877: 
7878: The fluid state is, to all appearance, older than the solid state, and
7879: plants as well as animal bodies are fashioned out of fluid nutritive
7880: matter, so far as this forms itself in a state of rest. This last
7881: of course primarily combines and forms itself in freedom according
7882: to a certain original disposition directed towards purposes (which,
7883: as will be shown in Part II., must not be judged aesthetically but
7884: teleologically according to the principle of realism), but also perhaps
7885: in conformity with the universal law of the affinity of materials.
7886: Again, the watery fluids dissolved in an atmosphere that is a mixture
7887: of different gases, if they separate from the latter on account of
7888: cooling, produce snow figures, which in correspondence with the
7889: character of the special mixture of gases, often seem very artistic and
7890: are extremely beautiful. So, without detracting from the teleological
7891: principle by which we judge of organisation, we may well think that
7892: the beauty of flowers, of the plumage of birds, or of shell-fish,
7893: both in shape and colour, may be ascribed to nature and its faculty
7894: of producing forms in an aesthetically purposive way, in its freedom,
7895: without particular purposes adapted thereto, according to chemical laws
7896: by the arrangement of the material requisite for the organisation in
7897: question.
7898: 
7899: But what shows the principle of the _Ideality_ of the purposiveness in
7900: the beauty of nature, as that which we always place at the basis of
7901: an aesthetical judgement, and which allows us to employ, as a ground
7902: of explanation for our representative faculty, no realism of purpose,
7903: is the fact that in judging beauty we invariably seek its gauge in
7904: ourselves _a priori_, and that our aesthetical Judgement is itself
7905: legislative in respect of the judgement whether anything is beautiful
7906: or not. This could not be, on the assumption of the Realism of the
7907: purposiveness of nature; because in that case we must have learned from
7908: nature what we ought to find beautiful, and the aesthetical judgement
7909: would be subjected to empirical principles. For in such an act of
7910: judging the important point is not, what nature is, or even, as a
7911: purpose, is in relation to us, but how we take it. There would be an
7912: objective purposiveness in nature if it had fashioned its forms for our
7913: satisfaction; and not a subjective purposiveness which depended upon
7914: the play of the Imagination in its freedom, where it is we who receive
7915: nature with favour, not nature which shows us favour. The property
7916: of nature that gives us occasion to perceive the inner purposiveness
7917: in the relation of our mental faculties in judging certain of its
7918: products--a purposiveness which is to be explained on supersensible
7919: grounds as necessary and universal--cannot be a natural purpose or be
7920: judged by us as such; for otherwise the judgement hereby determined
7921: would not be free, and would have at its basis heteronomy, and not, as
7922: beseems a judgement of taste, autonomy.
7923: 
7924: In beautiful Art the principle of the Idealism of purposiveness
7925: is still clearer. As in the case of the beautiful in Nature, an
7926: aesthetical Realism of this purposiveness cannot be perceived by
7927: sensations (for then the art would be only pleasant, not beautiful).
7928: But that the satisfaction produced by aesthetical Ideas must not depend
7929: on the attainment of definite purposes (as in mechanically designed
7930: art), and that consequently, in the very rationalism of the principle,
7931: the ideality of the purposes and not their reality must be fundamental,
7932: appears from the fact that beautiful Art, as such, must not be
7933: considered as a product of Understanding and Science, but of Genius,
7934: and therefore must get its rule through _aesthetical_ Ideas, which are
7935: essentially different from rational Ideas of definite purposes.
7936: 
7937: Just as the _ideality_ of the objects of sense as phenomena is the only
7938: way of explaining the possibility of their forms being susceptible
7939: of _a priori_ determination, so the _idealism_ of purposiveness, in
7940: judging the beautiful in nature and art, is the only hypothesis under
7941: which Criticism can explain the possibility of a judgement of taste
7942: which demands _a priori_ validity for every one (without grounding on
7943: concepts the purposiveness that is represented in the Object).
7944: 
7945: 
7946: § 59. _Of Beauty as the symbol of Morality_
7947: 
7948: Intuitions are always required to establish the reality of our
7949: concepts. If the concepts are empirical, the intuitions are called
7950: _examples_. If they are pure concepts of Understanding, the intuitions
7951: are called _schemata_. If we desire to establish the objective reality
7952: of rational concepts, _i.e._ of Ideas, on behalf of theoretical
7953: cognition, then we are asking for something impossible, because
7954: absolutely no intuition can be given which shall be adequate to them.
7955: 
7956: All _hypotyposis_ (presentation, _subjectio sub adspectum_), or
7957: sensible illustration, is twofold. It is either _schematical_, when to
7958: a concept comprehended by the Understanding the corresponding intuition
7959: is given _a priori_; or it is _symbolical_. In the latter case to a
7960: concept only thinkable by the Reason, to which no sensible intuition
7961: can be adequate, an intuition is supplied with which accords a
7962: procedure of the Judgement analogous to what it observes in schematism:
7963: it accords with it, that is, in respect of the rule of this procedure
7964: merely, not of the intuition itself; consequently in respect of the
7965: form of reflection merely, and not of its content.
7966: 
7967: There is a use of the word _symbolical_ that has been adopted by modern
7968: logicians, which is misleading and incorrect, _i.e._ to speak of the
7969: _symbolical_ mode of representation as if it were opposed to the
7970: _intuitive_; for the symbolical is only a mode of the intuitive. The
7971: latter (the intuitive), that is, may be divided into the _schematical_
7972: and the _symbolical_ modes of representation. Both are hypotyposes,
7973: _i.e._ presentations (_exhibitiones_); not mere _characterisations_, or
7974: designations of concepts by accompanying sensible signs which contain
7975: nothing belonging to the intuition of the Object, and only serve as a
7976: means for reproducing the concepts, according to the law of association
7977: of the Imagination, and consequently in a subjective point of view.
7978: These are either words, or visible (algebraical, even mimetical) signs,
7979: as mere expressions for concepts.[103]
7980: 
7981: All intuitions, which we supply to concepts _a priori_, are therefore
7982: either _schemata_ or _symbols_, of which the former contain direct,
7983: the latter indirect, presentations of the concept. The former do
7984: this demonstratively; the latter by means of an analogy (for which
7985: we avail ourselves even of empirical intuitions) in which the
7986: Judgement exercises a double function; first applying the concept
7987: to the object of a sensible intuition, and then applying the mere
7988: rule of the reflection made upon that intuition to a quite different
7989: object of which the first is only the symbol. Thus a monarchical
7990: state is represented by a living body, if it is governed by national
7991: laws, and by a mere machine (like a hand-mill) if governed by an
7992: individual absolute will; but in both cases only _symbolically_.
7993: For between a despotic state and a hand-mill there is, to be sure,
7994: no similarity; but there is a similarity in the rules according to
7995: which we reflect upon these two things and their causality. This
7996: matter has not been sufficiently analysed hitherto, for it deserves
7997: a deeper investigation; but this is not the place to linger over it.
7998: Our language [_i.e._ German] is full of indirect presentations of
7999: this sort, in which the expression does not contain the proper schema
8000: for the concept, but merely a symbol for reflection. Thus the words
8001: _ground_ (support, basis), _to depend_ (to be held up from above), to
8002: _flow_ from something (instead of, to follow), _substance_ (as _Locke_
8003: expresses it, the support of accidents), and countless others, are not
8004: schematical but symbolical hypotyposes and expressions for concepts,
8005: not by means of a direct intuition, but only by analogy with it,
8006: _i.e._ by the transference of reflection upon an object of intuition
8007: to a quite different concept to which perhaps an intuition can never
8008: directly correspond. If we are to give the name of cognition to a mere
8009: mode of representation (which is quite permissible if the latter is
8010: not a principle of the theoretical determination of what an object is
8011: in itself, but of the practical determination of what the Idea of it
8012: should be for us and for its purposive use), then all our knowledge
8013: of God is merely symbolical; and he who regards it as schematical,
8014: along with the properties of Understanding, Will, etc., which only
8015: establish their objective reality in beings of this world, falls into
8016: Anthropomorphism, just as he who gives up every intuitive element
8017: falls into Deism, by which nothing at all is cognised, not even in a
8018: practical point of view.
8019: 
8020: Now I say the Beautiful is the symbol of the morally Good, and that it
8021: is only in this respect (a reference which is natural to every man and
8022: which every man postulates in others as a duty) that it gives pleasure
8023: with a claim for the agreement of every one else. By this the mind
8024: is made conscious of a certain ennoblement and elevation above the
8025: mere sensibility to pleasure received through sense, and the worth of
8026: others is estimated in accordance with a like maxim of their Judgement.
8027: That is the _intelligible_, to which, as pointed out in the preceding
8028: paragraph, Taste looks; with which our higher cognitive faculties are
8029: in accord; and without which a downright contradiction would arise
8030: between their nature and the claims made by taste. In this faculty the
8031: Judgement does not see itself, as in empirical judging, subjected to
8032: a heteronomy of empirical laws; it gives the law to itself in respect
8033: of the objects of so pure a satisfaction, just as the Reason does in
8034: respect of the faculty of desire. Hence, both on account of this inner
8035: possibility in the subject and of the external possibility of a nature
8036: that agrees with it, it finds itself to be referred to something within
8037: the subject as well as without him, something which is neither nature
8038: nor freedom, but which yet is connected with the supersensible ground
8039: of the latter. In this supersensible ground, therefore, the theoretical
8040: faculty is bound together in unity with the practical, in a way which
8041: though common is yet unknown. We shall indicate some points of this
8042: analogy, while at the same time we shall note the differences.
8043: 
8044: (1) The beautiful pleases _immediately_ (but only in reflective
8045: intuition, not, like morality, in its concept). (2) It pleases _apart
8046: from any interest_ (the morally good is indeed necessarily bound up
8047: with an interest, though not with one which precedes the judgement upon
8048: the satisfaction, but with one which is first of all produced by it).
8049: (3) The _freedom_ of the Imagination (and therefore of the sensibility
8050: of our faculty) is represented in judging the beautiful as harmonious
8051: with the conformity to law of the Understanding (in the moral judgement
8052: the freedom of the will is thought as the harmony of the latter with
8053: itself according to universal laws of Reason). (4) The subjective
8054: principle in judging the beautiful is represented as _universal_,
8055: _i.e._ as valid for every man, though not cognisable through any
8056: universal concept. (The objective principle of morality is also
8057: expounded as universal, _i.e._ for every subject and for every action
8058: of the same subject, and thus as cognisable by means of a universal
8059: concept). Hence the moral judgement is not only susceptible of definite
8060: constitutive principles, but is possible _only_ by grounding its maxims
8061: on these in their universality.
8062: 
8063: A reference to this analogy is usual even with the common Understanding
8064: [of men], and we often describe beautiful objects of nature or art by
8065: names that seem to put a moral appreciation at their basis. We call
8066: buildings or trees majestic and magnificent, landscapes laughing and
8067: gay; even colours are called innocent, modest, tender, because they
8068: excite sensations which have something analogous to the consciousness
8069: of the state of mind brought about by moral judgements. Taste makes
8070: possible the transition, without any violent leap, from the charm of
8071: Sense to habitual moral interest; for it represents the Imagination
8072: in its freedom as capable of purposive determination for the
8073: Understanding, and so teaches us to find even in objects of sense a
8074: free satisfaction apart from any charm of sense.

8079: APPENDIX
8080: 
8081: 
8082: § 60. _Of the method of Taste_
8083: 
8084: The division of a Critique into Elementology and Methodology, as
8085: preparatory to science, is not applicable to the Critique of taste,
8086: because there neither is nor can be a science of the Beautiful, and
8087: the judgement of taste is not determinable by means of principles. As
8088: for the scientific element in every art, which regards _truth_ in the
8089: presentation of its Object, this is indeed the indispensable condition
8090: (_conditio sine qua non_) of beautiful art, but not beautiful art
8091: itself. There is therefore for beautiful art only a _manner_ (_modus_),
8092: not a _method of teaching_ (_methodus_). The master must show what the
8093: pupil is to do and how he is to do it; and the universal rules, under
8094: which at last he brings his procedure, serve rather for bringing the
8095: main points back to his remembrance when occasion requires, than for
8096: prescribing them to him. Nevertheless regard must be had here to a
8097: certain ideal, which art must have before its eyes, although it cannot
8098: be completely attained in practice. It is only through exciting the
8099: Imagination of the pupil to accordance with a given concept, by making
8100: him note the inadequacy of the expression for the Idea, to which the
8101: concept itself does not attain because it is an aesthetical Idea, and
8102: by severe criticism, that he can be prevented from taking the examples
8103: set before him as types and models for imitation, to be subjected to
8104: no higher standard or independent judgement. It is thus that genius,
8105: and with it the freedom of the Imagination, is stifled by its very
8106: conformity to law; and without these no beautiful art, and not even an
8107: accurately judging individual taste, is possible.
8108: 
8109: The propaedeutic to all beautiful art, regarded in the highest degree
8110: of its perfection, seems to lie, not in precepts, but in the culture
8111: of the mental powers by means of those elements of knowledge called
8112: _humaniora_, probably because _humanity_ on the one side indicates
8113: the universal _feeling of sympathy_, and on the other the faculty
8114: of being able to _communicate_ universally our inmost [feelings].
8115: For these properties taken together constitute the characteristic
8116: social spirit[104] of humanity by which it is distinguished from the
8117: limitations of animal life. The age and peoples, in which the impulse
8118: towards a _law-abiding_ social life, by which a people becomes a
8119: permanent community, contended with the great difficulties presented by
8120: the difficult problem of uniting freedom (and therefore equality also)
8121: with compulsion (rather of respect and submission from a sense of duty
8122: than of fear)--such an age and such a people naturally first found out
8123: the art of reciprocal communication of Ideas between the cultivated
8124: and uncultivated classes and thus discovered how to harmonise the
8125: large-mindedness and refinement of the former with the natural
8126: simplicity and originality of the latter. In this way they first found
8127: that mean between the higher culture and simple nature which furnishes
8128: that true standard for taste as a sense common to all men which no
8129: universal rules can supply.
8130: 
8131: With difficulty will a later age dispense with those models, because
8132: it will be always farther from nature; and in fine, without having
8133: permanent examples before it, a concept will hardly be possible, in one
8134: and the same people, of the happy union of the law-abiding constraint
8135: of the highest culture with the force and truth of free nature which
8136: feels its own proper worth.
8137: 
8138: Now taste is at bottom a faculty for judging of the sensible
8139: illustration of moral Ideas (by means of a certain analogy involved
8140: in our reflection upon both these); and it is from this faculty also
8141: and from the greater susceptibility grounded thereon for the feeling
8142: arising from the latter (called moral feeling), that the pleasure is
8143: derived which taste regards as valid for mankind in general and not
8144: merely for the private feeling of each. Hence it appears plain that the
8145: true propaedeutic for the foundation of taste is the development of
8146: moral Ideas and the culture of the moral feeling; because it is only
8147: when sensibility is brought into agreement with this that genuine taste
8148: can assume a definite invariable form.

8153: THE CRITIQUE OF JUDGEMENT
8154: 
8155: PART II
8156: 
8157: CRITIQUE OF THE TELEOLOGICAL JUDGEMENT
8158: 
8159: 
8160: § 61. _Of the objective purposiveness of Nature_
8161: 
8162: We have on transcendental principles good ground to assume a subjective
8163: purposiveness in nature, in its particular laws, in reference to its
8164: comprehensibility by human Judgement and to the possibility of the
8165: connexion of particular experiences in a system. This may be expected
8166: as possible in many products of nature, which, as if they were devised
8167: quite specially for our Judgement, contain a specific form conformable
8168: thereto; which through their manifoldness and unity serve at once to
8169: strengthen and to sustain the mental powers (that come into play in the
8170: employment of this faculty); and to which therefore we give the name of
8171: _beautiful_ forms.
8172: 
8173: But that the things of nature serve one another as means to purposes,
8174: and that their possibility is only completely intelligible through
8175: this kind of causality--for this we have absolutely no ground in the
8176: universal Idea of nature, as the complex of the objects of sense. In
8177: the above-mentioned case, the representation of things, because it
8178: is something in ourselves, can be quite well thought _a priori_ as
8179: suitable and useful for the internally purposive determination of our
8180: cognitive faculties; but that purposes, which neither are our own
8181: nor belong to nature (for we do not regard nature as an intelligent
8182: being), could or should constitute a particular kind of causality, at
8183: least a quite special conformity to law,--this we have absolutely no
8184: _a priori_ reason for presuming. Yet more, experience itself cannot
8185: prove to us the actuality of this; there must then have preceded a
8186: rationalising subtlety which only sportively introduces the concept of
8187: purpose into the nature of things, but which does not derive it from
8188: Objects or from their empirical cognition. To this latter it is of
8189: more service to make nature comprehensible according to analogy with
8190: the subjective ground of the connexion of our representations, than to
8191: cognise it from objective grounds.
8192: 
8193: Further, objective purposiveness, as a principle of the possibility of
8194: things of nature, is so far removed from _necessary_ connexion with
8195: the concept of nature, that it is much oftener precisely that upon
8196: which one relies to prove the contingency of nature and of its form.
8197: When, _e.g._ we adduce the structure of a bird, the hollowness of its
8198: bones, the disposition of its wings for motion and of its tail for
8199: steering, _etc._, we say that all this is contingent in the highest
8200: degree according to the mere _nexus effectivus_ of nature, without
8201: calling in the aid of a particular kind of causality, namely that of
8202: purpose (_nexus finalis_). In other words, nature, considered as mere
8203: mechanism, could have produced its forms in a thousand other ways
8204: without stumbling upon the unity which is in accordance with such a
8205: principle. It is not in the concept of nature but quite apart from it
8206: that we can hope to find the least ground _a priori_ for this.
8207: 
8208: Nevertheless the teleological act of judgement is rightly brought to
8209: bear, at least problematically, upon the investigation of nature;
8210: but only in order to bring it under principles of observation and
8211: inquiry according to the _analogy_ with the causality of purpose,
8212: without any pretence to _explain_ it thereby. It belongs therefore to
8213: the reflective and not to the determinant judgement. The concept of
8214: combinations and forms of nature in accordance with purposes is then
8215: at least _one principle more_ for bringing its phenomena under rules
8216: where the laws of simply mechanical causality do not suffice. For we
8217: bring in a teleological ground, where we attribute causality in respect
8218: of an Object to the concept of an Object, as if it were to be found in
8219: nature (not in ourselves); or rather when we represent to ourselves the
8220: possibility of the Object after the analogy of that causality which
8221: we experience in ourselves, and consequently think nature technically
8222: as through a special faculty. If we did not ascribe to it such a
8223: method of action, its causality would have to be represented as blind
8224: mechanism. If, on the contrary, we supply to nature causes acting
8225: _designedly_, and consequently place at its basis teleology, not merely
8226: as a _regulative_ principle for the mere _judging_ of phenomena, to
8227: which nature can be thought as subject in its particular laws, but as a
8228: _constitutive_ principle of the _derivation_ of its products from their
8229: causes; then would the concept of a natural purpose no longer belong
8230: to the reflective but to the determinant Judgement. Then, in fact, it
8231: would not belong specially to the Judgement (like the concept of beauty
8232: regarded as formal subjective purposiveness), but as a rational concept
8233: it would introduce into natural science a new causality, which we only
8234: borrow from ourselves and ascribe to other beings, without meaning to
8235: assume them to be of the same kind with ourselves.

8240: FIRST DIVISION
8241: 
8242: ANALYTIC OF THE TELEOLOGICAL JUDGEMENT
8243: 
8244: 
8245: § 62. _Of the objective purposiveness which is merely formal as
8246: distinguished from that which is material_
8247: 
8248: All geometrical figures drawn on a principle display a manifold,
8249: oft admired, objective purposiveness; _i.e._ in reference to
8250: their usefulness for the solution of several problems by a single
8251: principle, or of the same problem in an infinite variety of ways. The
8252: purposiveness is here obviously objective and intellectual, not merely
8253: subjective and aesthetical. For it expresses the suitability of the
8254: figure for the production of many intended figures, and is cognised
8255: through Reason. But this purposiveness does not make the concept of the
8256: object itself possible, _i.e._ it is not regarded as possible merely
8257: with reference to this use.
8258: 
8259: In so simple a figure as the circle lies the key to the solution of a
8260: multitude of problems, each of which would demand various appliances;
8261: whereas the solution results of itself, as it were, as one of the
8262: infinite number of elegant properties of this figure. Are we, for
8263: example, asked to construct a triangle, being given the base and
8264: vertical angle? The problem is indeterminate, _i.e._ it can be solved
8265: in an infinite number of ways. But the circle embraces them altogether
8266: as the geometrical locus of the vertices of triangles satisfying
8267: the given conditions. Again, suppose that two lines are to cut one
8268: another so that the rectangle under the segments of the one should be
8269: equal to the rectangle under the segments of the other; the solution
8270: of the problem from this point of view presents much difficulty. But
8271: all chords intersecting inside a circle divide one another in this
8272: _proportion_. Other curved lines suggest other purposive solutions
8273: of which nothing was thought in the rule that furnished their
8274: construction. All conic sections in themselves and when compared with
8275: one another are fruitful in principles for the solution of a number of
8276: possible problems, however simple is the definition which determines
8277: their concept.--It is a true joy to see the zeal with which the old
8278: geometers investigated the properties of lines of this class, without
8279: allowing themselves to be led astray by the questions of narrow-minded
8280: persons, as to what use this knowledge would be. Thus they worked out
8281: the properties of the parabola without knowing the law of gravitation,
8282: which would have suggested to them its application to the trajectory of
8283: heavy bodies (for the motion of a heavy body can be seen to be parallel
8284: to the curve of a parabola). Again, they found out the properties
8285: of an ellipse without surmising that any of the heavenly bodies had
8286: weight, and without knowing the law of force at different distances
8287: from the point of attraction, which causes it to describe this curve
8288: in free motion. While they thus unconsciously worked for the science
8289: of the future, they delighted themselves with a purposiveness in
8290: the [essential] being of things which yet they were able to present
8291: completely _a priori_ in its necessity. _Plato_, himself master of
8292: this science, hinted at such an original constitution of things in
8293: the discovery of which we can dispense with all experience, and at
8294: the power of the mind to produce from its supersensible principle the
8295: harmony of beings (where the properties of number come in, with which
8296: the mind plays in music). This [he touches upon] in the inspiration
8297: that raised him above the concepts of experience to Ideas, which seem
8298: to him to be explicable only through an intellectual affinity with the
8299: origin of all beings. No wonder that he banished from his school the
8300: man who was ignorant of geometry, since he thought he could derive
8301: from pure intuition, which has its home in the human spirit, that
8302: which _Anaxagoras_ drew from empirical objects and their purposive
8303: combination. For in the very necessity of that which is purposive,
8304: and is constituted just as if it were designedly intended for our
8305: use,--but at the same time seems to belong originally to the being
8306: of things without any reference to our use--lies the ground of our
8307: great admiration of nature, and that not so much external as in our
8308: own Reason. It is surely excusable that this admiration should through
8309: misunderstanding gradually rise to the height of fanaticism.
8310: 
8311: But this intellectual purposiveness, although no doubt objective (not
8312: subjective like aesthetical purposiveness), is in reference to its
8313: possibility merely formal (not real). It can only be conceived as
8314: purposiveness in general without any [definite] purpose being assumed
8315: as its basis, and consequently without teleology being needed for it.
8316: The figure of a circle is an intuition which is determined by means
8317: of the Understanding according to a principle. The unity of this
8318: principle which I arbitrarily assume and use as fundamental concept,
8319: applied to a form of intuition (space) which is met with in myself as
8320: a representation and yet _a priori_, renders intelligible the unity of
8321: many rules resulting from the construction of that concept, which are
8322: purposive for many possible designs. But this purposiveness does not
8323: imply a _purpose_ or any other ground whatever. It is quite different
8324: if I meet with order and regularity in complexes of _things_, external
8325: to myself, enclosed within certain boundaries; as, _e.g._ in a garden,
8326: the order and regularity of the trees, flower-beds, and walks. These
8327: I cannot expect to derive _a priori_ from my bounding of space made
8328: after a rule of my own; for this order and regularity are existing
8329: things which must be given empirically in order to be known, and not
8330: a mere representation in myself determined _a priori_ according to a
8331: principle. So then the latter (empirical) purposiveness, as _real_, is
8332: dependent on the concept of a purpose.
8333: 
8334: But the ground of admiration for a perceived purposiveness, although
8335: it be in the being of things (so far as their concepts can be
8336: constructed), may very well be seen, and seen to be legitimate.
8337: The manifold rules whose unity (derived from a principle) excites
8338: admiration, are all synthetical and do not follow from the _concept_
8339: of the Object, _e.g._ of a circle; but require this Object to be
8340: given in intuition. Hence this unity gets the appearance of having
8341: empirically an external basis of rules distinct from our representative
8342: faculty; as if therefore the correspondence of the Object to that
8343: need of rules which is proper to the Understanding were contingent in
8344: itself, and therefore only possible by means of a purpose expressly
8345: directed thereto. Now because this harmony, notwithstanding all
8346: this purposiveness, is not cognised empirically but _a priori_, it
8347: should bring us of itself to this point--that space, through whose
8348: determination (by means of the Imagination, in accordance with a
8349: concept) the Object is alone possible, is not a characteristic of
8350: things external to me, but a mere mode of representation in myself.
8351: Hence, in the figure which I draw _in conformity with a concept_,
8352: _i.e._ in my own mode of representing that which is given to me
8353: externally, whatever it may be in itself, _it is I that introduce
8354: the purposiveness_; I get no empirical instruction from the Object
8355: about the purposiveness, and so I require in it no particular purpose
8356: external to myself. But because this consideration already calls for
8357: a critical employment of Reason, and consequently cannot be involved
8358: in the judging of the Object according to its properties; so this
8359: latter [judging] suggests to me immediately nothing but the unification
8360: of heterogeneous rules (even according to their very diversity) in
8361: a principle. This principle, without requiring any particular _a
8362: priori_ basis external to my concept, or indeed, generally speaking,
8363: to my representation, is yet cognised _a priori_ by me as true. Now
8364: _wonder_ is a shock of the mind arising from the incompatibility of a
8365: representation, and the rule given by its means, with the principles
8366: already lying at its basis; which provokes a doubt as to whether
8367: we have rightly seen or rightly judged. _Admiration_, however, is
8368: wonder which ever recurs, despite the disappearance of this doubt.
8369: Consequently the latter is a quite natural effect of that observed
8370: purposiveness in the being of things (as phenomena). It cannot
8371: indeed be censured, whilst the unification of the form of sensible
8372: intuition (space)--with the faculty of concepts (the Understanding)--is
8373: inexplicable to us; and that not only on account of the union being
8374: just of the kind that it is, but because it is enlarging for the mind
8375: to surmise [the existence of] something lying outside our sensible
8376: representations in which, although unknown to us, the ultimate
8377: ground of that agreement may be met with. We are, it is true, not
8378: necessitated to cognise this if we have only to do _a priori_ with the
8379: formal purposiveness of our representations; but the fact that we are
8380: compelled to look out beyond it inspires at the same time an admiration
8381: for the object that impels us thereto.
8382: 
8383: We are accustomed to speak of the above-mentioned properties of
8384: geometrical figures or of numbers as _beautiful_, on account of a
8385: certain _a priori_ purposiveness they have for all kinds of cognitive
8386: uses, this purposiveness being quite unexpected on account of the
8387: simplicity of the construction. We speak, _e.g._ of this or that
8388: _beautiful_ property of the circle, which was discovered in this or
8389: that way. But there is no aesthetical act of judgement through which we
8390: find it purposive, no act of judgement without a concept which renders
8391: noticeable a mere _subjective_ purposiveness in the free play of our
8392: cognitive faculties; but an intellectual act according to concepts
8393: which enables us clearly to cognise an objective purposiveness,
8394: _i.e._ availableness for all kinds of (infinitely manifold) purposes.
8395: We must rather call this _relative perfection_ than a beauty of the
8396: mathematical figure. To speak thus of an _intellectual beauty_ cannot
8397: in general be permissible; for otherwise the word beauty would lose
8398: all determinate significance, or the intellectual satisfaction all
8399: superiority over the sensible. We should rather call a _demonstration_
8400: of such properties beautiful, because through it the Understanding
8401: as the faculty of concepts, and the Imagination as the faculty of
8402: presenting them, feel themselves strengthened _a priori_. (This, when
8403: viewed in connexion with the precision introduced by Reason, is spoken
8404: of as elegant.) Here, however, the satisfaction, although it is based
8405: on concepts, is subjective; while perfection brings with itself an
8406: objective satisfaction.
8407: 
8408: 
8409: § 63. _Of the relative, as distinguished from the inner, purposiveness
8410: of nature_
8411: 
8412: Experience leads our Judgement to the concept of an objective and
8413: material purposiveness, _i.e._ to the concept of a purpose of nature,
8414: only when[105] we have to judge of a relation of cause to effect which
8415: we find ourselves able to apprehend as legitimate only by presupposing
8416: the Idea of the effect of the causality of the cause as the fundamental
8417: condition, in the cause, of the possibility of the effect. This can
8418: take place in two ways. We may regard the effect directly as an art
8419: product, or only as material for the art of other possible natural
8420: beings; in other words, either as a purpose or as a means towards the
8421: purposive employment of other causes. This latter purposiveness is
8422: called utility (for man) or mere advantage (for other creatures), and
8423: is merely relative; while the former is an inner purposiveness of the
8424: natural being.
8425: 
8426: For example, rivers bring down with them all kinds of earth serviceable
8427: for the growth of plants which sometimes is deposited inland, often
8428: also at their mouths. The tide brings this mud to many coasts over
8429: the land or deposits it on the shore; and so, more especially if men
8430: give their aid so that the ebb shall not carry it back again, the
8431: fruit-bearing land increases in area, and the vegetable kingdom gains
8432: the place which formerly was the habitation of fish and shells. In
8433: this way has nature itself brought about most of the extensions of the
8434: land, and still continues to do so, although very slowly.--Now the
8435: question is whether this is to be judged a purpose of nature, because
8436: it contains utility for men. We cannot put it down to the account of
8437: the vegetable kingdom, because just as much is subtracted from sea-life
8438: as is added to land-life.
8439: 
8440: Or, to give an example of the advantageousness of certain natural
8441: things as means for other creatures (if we suppose them to be means),
8442: no soil is more suitable to pine trees than a sandy soil. Now the deep
8443: sea, before it withdrew from the land, left behind large tracts of sand
8444: in our northern regions, so that on this soil, so unfavourable for all
8445: cultivation, widely extended pine forests were enabled to grow, for the
8446: unreasoning destruction of which we frequently blame our ancestors.
8447: We may ask if this original deposit of tracts of sand was a purpose
8448: of nature for the benefit of the possible pine forests? So much is
8449: clear, that if we regard this as a purpose of nature, we must also
8450: regard the sand as a relative purpose, in reference to which the ocean
8451: strand and its withdrawal were means: for in the series of the mutually
8452: subordinated members of a purposive combination, every member must be
8453: regarded as a purpose (though not as a final purpose), to which its
8454: proximate cause is the means. So too if cattle, sheep, horses, etc.,
8455: are to exist, there must be grass on the earth, but there must also
8456: be saline plants in the desert if camels are to thrive; and again
8457: these and other herbivorous animals must be met with in numbers if
8458: there are to be wolves, tigers, and lions. Consequently the objective
8459: purposiveness, which is based upon advantage, is not an objective
8460: purposiveness of things in themselves; as if the sand could not be
8461: conceived for itself as an effect of a cause, viz. the sea, without
8462: attributing to the latter a purpose, and regarding the effect, namely,
8463: the sand, as a work of art. It is a merely relative purposiveness
8464: contingent upon the thing to which it is ascribed; and although in the
8465: examples we have cited, the different kinds of grass are to be judged
8466: as in themselves organised products of nature, and consequently as
8467: artificial, yet are they to be regarded, in reference to the beasts
8468: which feed upon them, as mere raw material.
8469: 
8470: But above all, though man, through the freedom of his causality, finds
8471: certain natural things of advantage for his designs--designs often
8472: foolish, such as using the variegated plumage of birds to adorn his
8473: clothes, or coloured earths and the juices of plants for painting his
8474: face; often again reasonable as when the horse is used for riding, the
8475: ox or (as in Minorca) the ass or pig for ploughing--yet we cannot even
8476: here assume a relative natural purpose. For his Reason knows how to
8477: give things a conformity with his own arbitrary fancies for which he
8478: was not at all predestined by nature. Only, _if_ we assume that men are
8479: to live upon the earth, then the means must be there without which they
8480: could not exist as animals, and even as rational animals (in however
8481: low a degree of rationality); and thereupon those natural things,
8482: which are indispensable in this regard, must be considered as natural
8483: purposes.
8484: 
8485: We can hence easily see that external purposiveness (advantage of one
8486: thing in respect of others) can be regarded as an external natural
8487: purpose only under the condition, that the existence of that [being],
8488: to which it is immediately or distantly advantageous, is in itself a
8489: purpose of nature. Since that can never be completely determined by
8490: mere contemplation of nature, it follows that relative purposiveness,
8491: although it hypothetically gives indications of natural purposes, yet
8492: justifies no absolute teleological judgement.
8493: 
8494: Snow in cold countries protects the crops from the frost; it makes
8495: human intercourse easier (by means of sleighs). The Laplander finds in
8496: his country animals by whose aid this intercourse is brought about,
8497: _i.e._ reindeer, who find sufficient sustenance in a dry moss which
8498: they have to scratch out for themselves from under the snow, and who
8499: are easily tamed and readily permit themselves to be deprived of that
8500: freedom in which they could have remained if they chose. For other
8501: people in the same frozen regions marine animals afford rich stores;
8502: in addition to the food and clothing which are thus supplied, and the
8503: wood which is floated in by the sea to their dwellings, these marine
8504: animals provide material for fuel by which their huts are warmed. Here
8505: is a wonderful concurrence of many references of nature to one purpose;
8506: and all this applies to the cases of the Greenlander, the Lapp, the
8507: Samoyede, the inhabitant of Yakutsk, etc. But then we do not see why,
8508: generally, men must live there at all. Therefore to say that vapour
8509: falls out of the atmosphere in the form of snow, that the sea has its
8510: currents which float down wood that has grown in warmer lands, and that
8511: there are in it great sea monsters filled with oil, _because_ the idea
8512: of advantage for certain poor creatures is fundamental for the cause
8513: which collects all these natural products, would be a very venturesome
8514: and arbitrary judgement. For even if there were none of this natural
8515: utility, we should miss nothing as regards the adequateness of natural
8516: causes to nature’s constitution; much more even to desire such a
8517: tendency in, and to attribute such a purpose to, nature would be the
8518: part of a presumptuous and inconsiderate fancy. For indeed it might be
8519: observed that it could only have been the greatest unsociability among
8520: men which thus scattered them into such inhospitable regions.
8521: 
8522: 
8523: § 64. _Of the peculiar character of things as natural purposes_
8524: 
8525: In order to see that a thing is only possible as a purpose, that is,
8526: to be forced to seek the causality of its origin not in the mechanism
8527: of nature but in a cause whose faculty of action is determined through
8528: concepts, it is requisite that its form be not possible according to
8529: mere natural laws, _i.e._ laws which can be cognised by us through the
8530: Understanding alone when applied to objects of Sense; but that even the
8531: empirical knowledge of it as regards its cause and effect presupposes
8532: concepts of Reason. This _contingency_ of its form in all empirical
8533: natural laws in reference to Reason affords a ground for regarding its
8534: causality as possible only through Reason. For Reason, which must
8535: cognise the necessity of every form of a natural product in order to
8536: comprehend even the conditions of its genesis, cannot assume such
8537: [natural] necessity in that particular given form. The causality of its
8538: origin is then referred to the faculty of acting in accordance with
8539: purposes (a will); and the Object which can only thus be represented as
8540: possible is represented as a purpose.
8541: 
8542: If in a seemingly uninhabited country a man perceived a geometrical
8543: figure, say a regular hexagon, inscribed on the sand, his reflection
8544: busied with such a concept would attribute, although obscurely, the
8545: unity in the principle of its genesis to Reason, and consequently would
8546: not regard as a ground of the possibility of such a shape the sand, or
8547: the neighbouring sea, or the winds, or beasts with familiar footprints,
8548: or any other irrational cause. For the chance against meeting with
8549: such a concept, which is only possible through Reason, would seem so
8550: infinitely great, that it would be just as if there were no natural
8551: law, no cause in the mere mechanical working of nature capable of
8552: producing it; but as if only the concept of such an Object, as a
8553: concept which Reason alone can supply and with which it can compare the
8554: thing, could contain the causality for such an effect. This then would
8555: be regarded as a purpose, but as a product of _art_, not as a natural
8556: purpose (_vestigium hominis video_).[106]
8557: 
8558: But in order to regard a thing cognised as a natural product as a
8559: purpose also--consequently as a _natural purpose_, if this is not a
8560: contradiction--something more is required. I would say provisionally:
8561: a thing exists as a natural purpose, if it is [although in a double
8562: sense][107] both _cause and effect of itself_. For herein lies a
8563: causality the like of which cannot be combined with the mere concept
8564: of a nature without attributing to it a purpose; it can certainly be
8565: thought without contradiction, but cannot be comprehended. We shall
8566: elucidate the determination of this Idea of a natural purpose by an
8567: example, before we analyse it completely.
8568: 
8569: In the first place, a tree generates another tree according to a
8570: known natural law. But the tree produced is of the same genus; and so
8571: it produces itself _generically_. On the one hand, as effect it is
8572: continually self-produced; on the other hand, as cause it continually
8573: produces itself, and so perpetuates itself generically.
8574: 
8575: Secondly, a tree produces itself as an _individual_. This kind of
8576: effect no doubt we call growth; but it is quite different from any
8577: increase according to mechanical laws, and is to be reckoned as
8578: generation, though under another name. The matter that the tree
8579: incorporates it previously works up into a specifically peculiar
8580: quality, which natural mechanism external to it cannot supply; and
8581: thus it develops itself by aid of a material which, as compounded,
8582: is its own product. No doubt, as regards the constituents got from
8583: nature without, it must only be regarded as an educt; but yet in
8584: the separation and recombination of this raw material we see such
8585: an originality in the separating and formative faculty of this kind
8586: of natural being, as is infinitely beyond the reach of art, if the
8587: attempt is made to reconstruct such vegetable products out of elements
8588: obtained by their dissection or material supplied by nature for their
8589: sustenance.
8590: 
8591: _Thirdly_, each part of a tree generates itself in such a way that the
8592: maintenance of any one part depends reciprocally on the maintenance of
8593: the rest. A bud of one tree engrafted on the twig of another produces
8594: in the alien stock a plant of its own kind, and so also a scion
8595: engrafted on a foreign stem. Hence we may regard each twig or leaf of
8596: the same tree as merely engrafted or inoculated into it, and so as an
8597: independent tree attached to another and parasitically nourished by
8598: it. At the same time, while the leaves are products of the tree they
8599: also in turn give support to it; for the repeated defoliation of a tree
8600: kills it, and its growth thus depends on the action of the leaves upon
8601: the stem. The self-help of nature in case of injury in the vegetable
8602: creation, when the want of a part that is necessary for the maintenance
8603: of its neighbours is supplied by the remaining parts; and the abortions
8604: or malformations in growth, in which certain parts, on account of
8605: casual defects or hindrances, form themselves in a new way to maintain
8606: what exists, and so produce an anomalous creature, I shall only mention
8607: in passing, though they are among the most wonderful properties of
8608: organised creatures.
8609: 
8610: 
8611: § 65. _Things regarded as natural purposes are organised beings_
8612: 
8613: According to the character alleged in the preceding section, a thing,
8614: which, though a natural product, is to be cognised as only possible as
8615: a natural purpose, must bear itself alternately as cause and as effect.
8616: This, however, is a somewhat inexact and indeterminate expression
8617: which needs derivation from a determinate concept.
8618: 
8619: Causal combination as thought merely by the Understanding is a
8620: connexion constituting an ever-progressive series (of causes and
8621: effects); and things which as effects presuppose others as causes
8622: cannot be reciprocally at the same time causes of these. This sort
8623: of causal combination we call that of effective causes (_nexus
8624: effectivus_). But on the other hand, a causal combination according to
8625: a concept of Reason (of purposes) can also be thought, which regarded
8626: as a series would lead either forwards or backwards; in this the thing
8627: that has been called the effect may with equal propriety be termed the
8628: cause of that of which it is the effect. In the practical department of
8629: human art we easily find connexions such as this; _e.g._ a house, no
8630: doubt, is the cause of the money received for rent, but also conversely
8631: the representation of this possible income was the cause of building
8632: the house. Such a causal connexion we call that of final causes (_nexus
8633: finalis_). We may perhaps suitably name the first the connexion of
8634: real causes, the second of those which are ideal; because from this
8635: nomenclature it is at once comprehended that there can be no more than
8636: these two kinds of causality.
8637: 
8638: For a thing to be a natural purpose in the _first_ place it is
8639: requisite that its parts (as regards their being and their form) are
8640: only possible through their reference to the whole. For the thing
8641: itself is a purpose and so is comprehended under a concept or an Idea
8642: which must determine _a priori_ all that is to be contained in it.
8643: But so far as a thing is only thought as possible in this way, it is
8644: a mere work of art; _i.e._ a product of one rational cause distinct
8645: from the matter (of the parts), whose causality (in the collection and
8646: combination of the parts) is determined through its Idea of a whole
8647: possible by their means (and consequently not through external nature).
8648: 
8649: But if a thing as a natural product is to involve in itself and in its
8650: internal possibility a reference to purposes,--_i.e._ to be possible
8651: only as a natural purpose, and without the causality of the concepts of
8652: rational beings external to itself,--then it is requisite _secondly_
8653: that its parts should so combine in the unity of a whole that they are
8654: reciprocally cause and effect of each other’s form. Only in this way
8655: can the Idea of the whole conversely (reciprocally) determine the form
8656: and combination of all the parts; not indeed as cause--for then it
8657: would be an artificial product--but as the ground of cognition, for him
8658: who is judging it, of the systematic unity and combination of all the
8659: manifold contained in the given material.
8660: 
8661: For a body then which is to be judged in itself and its internal
8662: possibility as a natural purpose, it is requisite that its parts
8663: mutually depend upon each other both as to their form and their
8664: combination, and so produce a whole by their own causality; while
8665: conversely the concept of the whole may be regarded as its cause
8666: according to a principle (in a being possessing a causality according
8667: to concepts adequate to such a product). In this case then the
8668: connexion of _effective causes_ may be judged as an _effect through
8669: final causes_.
8670: 
8671: In such a product of nature every part not only exists _by means
8672: of_ the other parts, but is thought as existing _for the sake of_
8673: the others and the whole, that is as an (organic) instrument. Thus,
8674: however, it might be an artificial instrument, and so might be
8675: represented only as a purpose that is possible in general; but also
8676: its parts are all organs reciprocally _producing_ each other. This can
8677: never be the case with artificial instruments, but only with nature
8678: which supplies all the material for instruments (even for those of
8679: art). Only a product of such a kind can be called a _natural purpose_,
8680: and this because it is an _organised_ and _self-organising being_.
8681: 
8682: In a watch one part is the instrument for moving the other parts, but
8683: the wheel is not the effective cause of the production of the others;
8684: no doubt one part is for the sake of the others, but it does not exist
8685: by their means. In this case the producing cause of the parts and of
8686: their form is not contained in the nature (of the material), but is
8687: external to it in a being which can produce effects according to Ideas
8688: of a whole possible by means of its causality. Hence a watch wheel
8689: does not produce other wheels, still less does one watch produce other
8690: watches, utilising (organising) foreign material for that purpose;
8691: hence it does not replace of itself parts of which it has been
8692: deprived, nor does it make good what is lacking in a first formation by
8693: the addition of the missing parts, nor if it has gone out of order does
8694: it repair itself--all of which, on the contrary, we may expect from
8695: organised nature.--An organised being is then not a mere machine, for
8696: that has merely _moving_ power, but it possesses in itself _formative_
8697: power of a self-propagating kind which it communicates to its materials
8698: though they have it not of themselves; it organises them, in fact, and
8699: this cannot be explained by the mere mechanical faculty of motion.
8700: 
8701: We say of nature and its faculty in organised products far too little
8702: if we describe it as an _analogon of art_; for this suggests an
8703: artificer (a rational being) external to it. Much rather does it
8704: organise itself and its organised products in every species, no doubt
8705: after one general pattern but yet with suitable deviations, which
8706: self-preservation demands according to circumstances. We perhaps
8707: approach nearer to this inscrutable property, if we describe it as
8708: an _analogon of life_; but then we must either endow matter, as mere
8709: matter, with a property which contradicts its very being (hylozoism),
8710: or associate therewith an alien principle _standing in communion_ with
8711: it (a soul). But in the latter case we must, if such a product is to be
8712: a natural product, either presuppose organised matter as the instrument
8713: of that soul, which does not make the soul a whit more comprehensible;
8714: or regard the soul as artificer of this structure and so remove
8715: the product from (corporeal) nature. To speak strictly, then, the
8716: organisation of nature has in it nothing analogous to any causality we
8717: know.[108] Beauty in nature can be rightly described as an analogon of
8718: art, because it is ascribed to objects only in reference to reflection
8719: upon their _external_ aspect, and consequently only on account of the
8720: form of their external surface. But _internal natural perfection_,
8721: as it belongs to those things which are only possible as _natural
8722: purposes_, and are therefore called organised beings, is not analogous
8723: to any physical, _i.e._ natural, faculty known to us; nay even,
8724: regarding ourselves as, in the widest sense, belonging to nature, it
8725: is not even thinkable or explicable by means of any exactly fitting
8726: analogy to human art.
8727: 
8728: The concept of a thing as in itself a natural purpose is therefore no
8729: constitutive concept of Understanding or of Reason, but it can serve
8730: as a regulative concept for the reflective Judgement, to guide our
8731: investigation about objects of this kind by a distant analogy with our
8732: own causality according to purposes generally, and in our meditations
8733: upon their ultimate ground. This latter use, however, is not in
8734: reference to the knowledge of nature or of its original ground, but
8735: rather to our own practical faculty of Reason, in analogy with which we
8736: considered the cause of that purposiveness.
8737: 
8738: Organised beings are then the only beings in nature which, considered
8739: in themselves and apart from any relation to other things, can be
8740: thought as possible only as purposes of nature. Hence they first
8741: afford objective reality to the concept of a _purpose of nature_, as
8742: distinguished from a practical purpose; and so they give to the science
8743: of nature the basis for a teleology, _i.e._ a mode of judgement about
8744: natural Objects according to a special principle which otherwise we
8745: should in no way be justified in introducing (because we cannot see _a
8746: priori_ the possibility of this kind of causality).
8747: 
8748: 
8749: § 66. _Of the principle of judging of internal purposiveness in
8750: organised beings_
8751: 
8752: This principle, which is at the same time a definition, is as follows:
8753: _An organised product of nature is one in which every part is
8754: reciprocally purpose, [end] and means._ In it nothing is vain, without
8755: purpose, or to be ascribed to a blind mechanism of nature.
8756: 
8757: This principle, as regards its occasion, is doubtless derived from
8758: experience, viz. from that methodised experience called observation;
8759: but on account of the universality and necessity which it ascribes to
8760: such purposiveness it cannot rest solely on empirical grounds, but
8761: must have at its basis an _a priori_ principle, although it be merely
8762: regulative and these purposes lie only in the idea of the judging
8763: [subject] and not in an effective cause. We may therefore describe
8764: the aforesaid principle as a _maxim_ for judging of the internal
8765: purposiveness of organised beings.
8766: 
8767: It is an acknowledged fact that the dissectors of plants and animals,
8768: in order to investigate their structure and to find out the reasons,
8769: why and for what end such parts, such a disposition and combination
8770: of parts, and just such an internal form have been given them, assume
8771: as indisputably necessary the maxim that nothing in such a creature
8772: is _vain_; just as they lay down as the fundamental proposition of
8773: the universal science of nature, that _nothing_ happens _by chance_.
8774: In fact, they can as little free themselves from this teleological
8775: proposition as from the universal physical proposition; for as without
8776: the latter we should have no experience at all, so without the former
8777: we should have no guiding thread for the observation of a species of
8778: natural things which we have thought teleologically under the concept
8779: of natural purposes.
8780: 
8781: Now this concept brings the Reason into a quite different order of
8782: things from that of a mere mechanism of nature, which is no longer
8783: satisfying here. An Idea is to be the ground of the possibility
8784: of the natural product. But because this is an absolute unity of
8785: representation, instead of the material being a plurality of things
8786: that can supply by itself no definite unity of composition,--if that
8787: unity of the Idea is to serve at all as the _a priori_ ground of
8788: determination of a natural law of the causality of such a form of
8789: composition,--the purpose of nature must be extended to _everything_
8790: included in its product. For if we once refer action of this sort _on
8791: the whole_ to any supersensible ground of determination beyond the
8792: blind mechanism of nature, we must judge of it altogether according to
8793: this principle; and we have then no reason to regard the form of such
8794: a thing as partly dependent on mechanism--for by such mixing up of
8795: disparate principles no certain rule of judging would be left.
8796: 
8797: For example, it may be that in an animal body many parts can be
8798: conceived as concretions according to mere mechanical laws (as the
8799: hide, the bones, the hair). And yet the cause which brings together the
8800: required matter, modifies it, forms it, and puts it in its appropriate
8801: place, must always be judged of teleologically; so that here everything
8802: must be considered as organised, and everything again in a certain
8803: relation to the thing itself is an organ.
8804: 
8805: 
8806: § 67. _Of the principle of the teleological judging of nature in
8807: general as a system of purposes_
8808: 
8809: We have already said above that the _external_ purposiveness of natural
8810: things affords no sufficient warrant for using them as purposes of
8811: nature in order to explain their presence, and for regarding their
8812: contingently purposive effects as the grounds of their presence
8813: according to the principle of final causes. Thus we cannot take
8814: for natural purposes, _rivers_ because they promote intercourse
8815: among inland peoples, _mountains_ because they contain the sources
8816: of the rivers and for their maintenance in rainless seasons have a
8817: store of snow, or the _slope_ of the land which carries away the
8818: water and leaves the country dry; because although this shape of the
8819: earth’s surface be very necessary for the origin and maintenance of
8820: the vegetable and animal kingdoms, it has nothing in itself for the
8821: possibility of which we are forced to assume a causality according to
8822: purposes. The same is true of plants which man uses for his needs or
8823: his pleasures; of beasts, the camel, the ox, the horse, dog, etc.,
8824: which are indispensable to him as well for food as because they are
8825: used in his service in many different ways. In the case of things
8826: which we have no reason for regarding in themselves as purposes, such
8827: external relation can only be hypothetically judged as purposive.
8828: 
8829: To judge of a thing as a natural purpose on account of its internal
8830: form is something very different from taking the existence of that
8831: thing to be a purpose of nature. For the latter assertion we require
8832: not merely the concept of a possible purpose, but the knowledge of
8833: the final purpose (_scopus_) of nature. But this requires a reference
8834: of such knowledge to something supersensible far transcending all our
8835: teleological knowledge of nature, for the purpose of [the existence
8836: of][109] nature must itself be sought beyond nature. The internal form
8837: of a mere blade of grass is sufficient to show that for our human
8838: faculty of judgement its origin is possible only according to the
8839: rule of purposes. But if we change our point of view and look to the
8840: use which other natural beings make of it, abandon the consideration
8841: of its internal organisation and only look to its externally purposive
8842: references, we shall arrive at no categorical purpose; all this
8843: purposive reference rests on an ever more distant condition, which, as
8844: unconditioned (the presence of a thing as final purpose), lies quite
8845: outside the physico-teleological view of the world. For example, grass
8846: is needful for the ox, which again is needful for man as a means of
8847: existence, but then we do not see why it is necessary that men should
8848: exist (a question this, which we shall not find so easy to answer if we
8849: sometimes cast our thoughts on the New Hollanders or the inhabitants
8850: of Tierra del Fuego). So conceived, the thing is not even a natural
8851: purpose, for neither it (nor its whole genus) is to be regarded as a
8852: natural product.
8853: 
8854: Hence it is only so far as matter is organised that it necessarily
8855: carries with it the concept of a natural purpose, because this its
8856: specific form is at the same time a product of nature. But this concept
8857: leads necessarily to the Idea of collective nature as a system in
8858: accordance with the rule of purposes, to which Idea all the mechanism
8859: of nature must be subordinated according to principles of Reason (at
8860: least in order to investigate natural phenomena therein). The principle
8861: of Reason belongs to it only as a subjective principle or a maxim: viz.
8862: everything in the World is some way good for something; nothing is vain
8863: in it. By the example that nature gives us in its organic products we
8864: are justified, nay called upon, to expect of it and of its laws nothing
8865: that is not purposive on the whole.
8866: 
8867: It is plain that this is not a principle for the determinant but
8868: only for the reflective Judgement; that it is regulative and not
8869: constitutive; and that we derive from it a clue by which we consider
8870: natural things in reference to an already given ground of determination
8871: according to a new law-abiding order; and extend our natural science
8872: according to a different principle, viz. that of final causes, but
8873: yet without prejudice to the principle of mechanical causality.
8874: Furthermore, it is in no wise thus decided, whether anything of which
8875: we judge by this principle, is a _designed_ purpose of nature; whether
8876: the grass is for the ox or the sheep, or whether these and the other
8877: things of nature are here for men. It is well also from this side
8878: to consider the things which are unpleasant to us and are contrary
8879: to purpose in particular references. Thus, for example, we can say:
8880: The vermin that torment men in their clothes, their hair, or their
8881: beds, may be, according to a wise appointment of nature, a motive to
8882: cleanliness which is in itself an important means for the preservation
8883: of health. Or again the mosquitoes and other stinging insects that
8884: make the wildernesses of America so oppressive to the savages, may be
8885: so many goads to activity for these primitive men, [inducing them] to
8886: drain the marshes and bring light into the forests which intercept
8887: every breath of air, and in this way, as well as by cultivating the
8888: soil, to make their habitations more healthy. The same thing, which
8889: appears to men contradictory to nature in its inner organisation, if
8890: viewed in this light gives an entertaining, sometimes an instructive,
8891: outlook into a teleological order of things, to which, without such
8892: a principle, mere physical observation would not lead us by itself.
8893: Thus some persons regard the tapeworm as given to the men or animals
8894: in whom it resides, as a kind of set-off for some defect in their
8895: vital organs; now I would ask if dreams (without which we never sleep,
8896: though we seldom remember them) may not be a purposive ordinance of
8897: nature? For during the relaxation of all the moving powers of the body,
8898: they serve to excite internally the vital organs by the medium of the
8899: Imagination and its great activity (which in this state generally rises
8900: to the height of affection). During sleep the Imagination commonly is
8901: more actively at play when the stomach is overloaded, in which case
8902: this excitement is the more necessary. Consequently, then, without this
8903: internal power of motion and this fatiguing unrest, on account of which
8904: we complain about our dreams (though in fact they are rather remedial),
8905: sleep even in a sound state of health would be a complete extinction of
8906: life.
8907: 
8908: Also the beauty of nature, _i.e._ its connexion with the free play of
8909: our cognitive faculties in apprehending and judging of its appearance,
8910: can be regarded as a kind of objective purposiveness of nature in its
8911: whole [content] as a system of which man is a member; if once the
8912: teleological judging of the same by means of the natural purposes which
8913: organised beings suggest to us, has justified for us the Idea of a
8914: great system of purposes of nature. We can regard it as a favour[110]
8915: which nature has felt for us, that in addition to what is useful it
8916: has so profusely dispensed beauty and charm; and we can therefore love
8917: it, as well as regard it with respect on account of its immensity,
8918: and feel ourselves ennobled by such regard; just as if nature had
8919: established and adorned its splendid theatre precisely with this view.
8920: 
8921: We shall say only one thing more in this paragraph. If we have once
8922: discovered in nature a faculty of bringing forth products that can
8923: only be thought by us in accordance with the concept of final causes,
8924: we go further still. We venture to judge that things belong to a
8925: system of purposes, which yet do not (either in themselves or in their
8926: purposive relations) necessitate our seeking for any principle of
8927: their possibility beyond the mechanism of causes working blindly. For
8928: the first Idea, as concerns its ground, already brings us beyond the
8929: world of sense; since the unity of the supersensible principle must be
8930: regarded as valid in this way not merely for certain species of natural
8931: beings, but for the whole of nature as a system.
8932: 
8933: 
8934: § 68. _Of the principle of Teleology as internal principle of natural
8935: science_
8936: 
8937: The principles of a science are either internal to it and are then
8938: called domestic (_principia domestica_), or are based on concepts that
8939: can only find their place outside it and so are _foreign_ principles
8940: (_peregrina_). Sciences that contain the latter, place at the basis of
8941: their doctrines auxiliary propositions (_lemmata_), _i.e._ they borrow
8942: some concept, and with it a ground of arrangement, from another science.
8943: 
8944: Every science is in itself a system, and it is not enough in it to
8945: build in accordance with principles and thus to employ a technical
8946: procedure, but we must go to work with it architectonically, as a
8947: building subsisting for itself; we must not treat it as an additional
8948: wing or part of another building, but as a whole in itself, although we
8949: may subsequently make a passage from it into that other or conversely.
8950: 
8951: If then we introduce into the context of natural science the concept of
8952: God in order to explain the purposiveness in nature, and subsequently
8953: use this purposiveness to prove that there is a God, there is no
8954: internal consistency in either science [_i.e._ either in natural
8955: science or theology]; and a delusive circle brings them both into
8956: uncertainty, because they have allowed their boundaries to overlap.
8957: 
8958: The expression, a purpose of nature, already sufficiently prevents the
8959: confusion of mixing up natural science and the occasion that it gives
8960: for judging _teleologically_ of its objects, with the consideration of
8961: God, and so of a _theological_ derivation of them. We must not regard
8962: it as insignificant, if one interchanges this expression with that of
8963: a divine purpose in the ordering of nature, or gives out the latter
8964: as more suitable and proper for a pious soul, because it must come in
8965: the end to deriving these purposive forms in nature from a wise author
8966: of the world. On the contrary, we must carefully and modestly limit
8967: ourselves to the expression, a purpose of nature, which asserts exactly
8968: as much as we know. Before we ask after the cause of nature itself, we
8969: find in nature, and in the course of its development, products of the
8970: same kind which are developed in it according to known empirical laws,
8971: in accordance with which natural science must judge of its objects,
8972: and, consequently, must seek in nature their causality according to
8973: the rule of purposes. So then it must not transgress its bounds in
8974: order to introduce into itself as a domestic principle that, to whose
8975: concept no experience can be commensurate, upon which we are only
8976: entitled to venture after the completion of natural science.
8977: 
8978: Natural characteristics which demonstrate themselves _a priori_, and
8979: consequently admit of insight into their possibility from universal
8980: principles without any admixture of experience, although they carry
8981: with them a technical purposiveness, yet cannot, because they are
8982: absolutely necessary, be referred to the Teleology of nature, as to a
8983: method belonging to Physic for solving its problems. Arithmetical or
8984: geometrical analogies, as well as universal mechanical laws,--however
8985: strange and admirable may seem to us the union of different rules,
8986: quite independent of one another according to all appearance, in a
8987: single principle,--possess on that account no claim to be teleological
8988: grounds of explanation in Physic. Even if they deserve to be brought
8989: into consideration in the universal theory of the purposiveness
8990: of things of nature, yet they belong to another [science], _i.e._
8991: Metaphysic, and constitute no internal principle of natural science;
8992: as with the empirical laws of natural purposes in organised beings, it
8993: is not only permissible but unavoidable to use the teleological _mode
8994: of judging_ as a principle of the doctrine of nature in regard to a
8995: particular class of its objects.
8996: 
8997: So to the end that Physic may keep within its own bounds, it
8998: abstracts itself entirely from the question, whether natural purposes
8999: are _designed_ or _undesigned_; for that would be to meddle in an
9000: extraneous business, in Metaphysic. It is enough that there are
9001: objects, alone _explicable_ according to natural laws which we
9002: can only think by means of the Idea of purposes as principle, and
9003: also alone internally _cognisable_ as concerns their internal form,
9004: in this way. In order, therefore, to remove the suspicion of the
9005: slightest assumption,--as if we wished to mix with our grounds
9006: of cognition something not belonging to Physic at all, viz. a
9007: supernatural cause,--we speak in Teleology, indeed, of nature as if the
9008: purposiveness therein were designed, but in such a way that this design
9009: is ascribed to nature, _i.e._ to matter. Now in this way there can be
9010: no misunderstanding, because no design in the proper meaning of the
9011: word can possibly be ascribed to inanimate matter; we thus give notice
9012: that this word here only expresses a principle of the reflective not of
9013: the determinant Judgement, and so is to introduce no particular ground
9014: of causality; but only adds for the use of the Reason a different kind
9015: of investigation from that according to mechanical laws, in order to
9016: supplement the inadequacy of the latter even for empirical research
9017: into all particular laws of nature. Hence we speak quite correctly
9018: in Teleology, so far as it is referred to Physic, of the wisdom, the
9019: economy, the forethought, the beneficence of Nature, without either
9020: making an intelligent being of it, for that would be preposterous; or
9021: even without presuming to place another intelligent Being above it as
9022: its Architect, for that would be presumptuous.[111] But there should
9023: be only signified thereby a kind of causality of nature after the
9024: analogy of our own in the technical use of Reason, in order to have
9025: before us the rule according to which certain products of nature must
9026: be investigated.
9027: 
9028: But now why is it that Teleology usually forms no proper part of
9029: theoretical natural science, but is regarded as a propaedeutic or
9030: transition to Theology? This is done in order to restrict the study
9031: of nature, mechanically considered, to that which we can so subject
9032: to observation or experiment that we are able to produce it ourselves
9033: as nature does, or at least by similar laws. For we see into a thing
9034: completely only so far as we can make it in accordance with our
9035: concepts and bring it to completion. But organisation, as an inner
9036: purpose of nature, infinitely surpasses all our faculty of presenting
9037: the like by means of art. And as concerns the external contrivances
9038: of nature regarded as purposive (wind, rain, etc.), Physic, indeed,
9039: considers their mechanism, but it cannot at all present their reference
9040: to purposes, so far as this is a condition necessarily belonging to
9041: cause; for this necessity of connexion has to do altogether with the
9042: combination of our concepts and not with the constitution of things.
9043: 
9044: 
9045: 
9046: 
9047: SECOND DIVISION
9048: 
9049: DIALECTIC OF THE TELEOLOGICAL JUDGEMENT
9050: 
9051: 
9052: § 69. _What is an antinomy of the Judgement?_
9053: 
9054: The _determinant_ Judgement has for itself no principles which are
9055: the foundation of _concepts of Objects_. It has no autonomy, for it
9056: _subsumes_ only under given laws or concepts as principles. Hence it
9057: is exposed to no danger of an antinomy of its own or to a conflict of
9058: its principles. So [we saw that] the transcendental Judgement which
9059: contains the conditions of subsuming under categories was for itself
9060: not _nomothetic_, but that it only indicated the conditions of sensuous
9061: intuition, under which reality (application) can be supplied to a given
9062: concept, as law of the Understanding, whereby the Judgement could never
9063: fall into discord with itself (at least as far as its principles are
9064: concerned).
9065: 
9066: But the _reflective_ Judgement must subsume under a law, which is not
9067: yet given, and is therefore in fact only a principle of reflection
9068: upon objects, for which we are objectively quite in want of a law or
9069: of a concept of an Object that would be adequate as a principle for
9070: the cases that occur. Since now no use of the cognitive faculties
9071: can be permitted without principles, the reflective Judgement must
9072: in such cases serve as a principle for itself. This, because it is
9073: not objective and can supply no ground of cognition of the Object
9074: adequate for design, must serve as a mere subjective principle, for the
9075: purposive employment of our cognitive faculties, _i.e._ for reflecting
9076: upon a class of objects. Therefore in reference to such cases the
9077: reflective Judgement has its maxims--necessary maxims--on behalf of
9078: the cognition of natural laws in experience, in order to attain by
9079: their means to concepts, even concepts of Reason; since it has absolute
9080: need of such in order to learn merely to cognise nature according to
9081: its empirical laws.--Between these necessary maxims of the reflective
9082: Judgement there may be a conflict and consequently an antinomy, upon
9083: which a Dialectic bases itself. If each of two conflicting maxims has
9084: its ground in the nature of the cognitive faculties, this may be called
9085: a natural Dialectic, and an unavoidable illusion which we must expose
9086: and resolve in our Critique, to the end that it may not deceive us.
9087: 
9088: 
9089: § 70. _Representation of this antinomy_
9090: 
9091: So far as Reason has to do with nature, as the complex of objects
9092: of external sense, it can base itself partly upon laws which the
9093: Understanding itself prescribes _a priori_ to nature, partly upon
9094: laws which it can extend indefinitely by means of the empirical
9095: determinations occurring in experience. To apply the former kind of
9096: laws, _i.e._ the _universal_ laws of material nature in general, the
9097: Judgement needs no special principle of reflection, since it is there
9098: determinant because an objective principle is given to it through
9099: Understanding. But as regards the particular laws that can only be made
9100: known to us through experience, there can be under them such great
9101: manifoldness and diversity, that the Judgement must serve as its own
9102: principle in order to investigate and search into the phenomena of
9103: nature in accordance with a law. Such a guiding thread is needed, if
9104: we are only to hope for a connected empirical cognition according to
9105: a thoroughgoing conformity of nature to law, even its unity according
9106: to empirical laws. In this contingent unity of particular laws it may
9107: very well happen that the Judgement in its reflection proceeds from
9108: two maxims. One of these is suggested to it _a priori_ by the mere
9109: Understanding; but the other is prompted by particular experiences,
9110: which bring the Reason into play in order to form a judgement upon
9111: corporeal nature and its laws in accordance with a particular
9112: principle. Hence it comes about that these two kinds of maxims seem to
9113: be incapable of existing together, and consequently a Dialectic arises
9114: which leads the Judgement into error in the principle of its reflection.
9115: 
9116: The _first maxim_ of Judgement is the _proposition_: all production of
9117: material things and their forms must be judged to be possible according
9118: to merely mechanical laws.
9119: 
9120: The _second maxim_ is the _counter-proposition_: some products of
9121: material nature cannot be judged to be possible according to merely
9122: mechanical laws. (To judge them requires quite a different law of
9123: causality, namely, that of final causes.)
9124: 
9125: If these regulative principles of investigation be converted into
9126: constitutive principles of the possibility of Objects, they will run
9127: thus:
9128: 
9129: _Proposition_: All production of material things is possible according
9130: to merely mechanical laws.
9131: 
9132: _Counter-proposition_: Some production of material things is not
9133: possible according to merely mechanical laws.
9134: 
9135: In this latter aspect, as objective principles for the determinant
9136: Judgement, they would contradict each other; and consequently one of
9137: the two propositions must necessarily be false. We shall then, it is
9138: true, have an antinomy, but not of Judgement; there will be a conflict
9139: in the legislation of Reason. Reason, however, can prove neither the
9140: one nor the other of these fundamental propositions, because we can
9141: have _a priori_ no determinant principle of the possibility of things
9142: according to mere empirical laws of nature.
9143: 
9144: On the other hand, as regards the first-mentioned maxims of a
9145: reflective Judgement, they involve no contradiction in fact. For if
9146: I say, I must _judge_, according to merely mechanical laws, of the
9147: possibility of all events in material nature, and consequently of all
9148: forms regarded as its products, I do not therefore say: _They are
9149: possible in this way alone_ (apart from any other kind of causality).
9150: All that is implied is: I _must_ always _reflect_ upon them _according
9151: to the principle_ of the mere mechanism of nature, and consequently
9152: investigate this as far as I can; because unless this lies at the
9153: basis of investigation, there can be no proper knowledge of nature at
9154: all. But this does not prevent us, if occasion offers, from following
9155: out the second maxim in the case of certain natural forms (and even
9156: by occasion of these in the whole of nature), in order to reflect
9157: upon them according to the principle of final causes, which is quite
9158: a different thing from explaining them according to the mechanism of
9159: nature. Reflection in accordance with the first maxim is thus not
9160: abrogated; on the contrary, we are told to follow it as far as we can.
9161: Nor is it said that these forms would not be possible in accordance
9162: with the mechanism of nature. It is only asserted that _human Reason_
9163: in following up this maxim and in this way could never find the least
9164: ground for that which constitutes the specific [character] of a natural
9165: purpose, although it would increase its knowledge of natural laws.
9166: Thus it is left undecided whether or not in the unknown inner ground
9167: of nature, physico-mechanical and purposive combination may be united
9168: in the same things in one principle. We only say that our Reason is
9169: not in a position so to unite them; and that therefore the Judgement
9170: (as _reflective_--from subjective grounds, not as determinant, in
9171: consequence of an objective principle of the possibility of things in
9172: themselves) is compelled to think a different principle from that of
9173: natural mechanism as the ground of the possibility of certain forms in
9174: nature.
9175: 
9176: 
9177: § 71. _Preliminary to the solution of the above antinomy_
9178: 
9179: We can in no way prove the impossibility of the production of organised
9180: natural products by the mere mechanism of nature, because we cannot
9181: see into the first inner ground of the infinite multiplicity of the
9182: particular laws of nature, which are contingent for us since they
9183: are only empirically known; and so we cannot arrive at the inner
9184: all-sufficient principle of the possibility of a nature (a principle
9185: which lies in the supersensible). Whether therefore the productive
9186: faculty of nature is sufficient for that which we judge to be formed
9187: or combined in accordance with the Idea of purposes, as well as
9188: for that which we believe to require merely a mechanical system
9189: [Maschinenwesen] of nature; or whether there lies at the basis of
9190: things which we must necessarily judge as properly natural purposes,
9191: a quite different kind of original causality, which cannot be
9192: contained in material nature or in its intelligible substrate, viz. an
9193: architectonic Understanding--this is a question to which our Reason,
9194: very narrowly limited in respect of the concept of causality if it
9195: is to be specified _a priori_, can give no answer whatever.--But it
9196: is just as certain and beyond doubt that, in regard to our cognitive
9197: faculties, the mere mechanism of nature can furnish no ground of
9198: explanation of the production of organised beings. _For the reflective
9199: Judgement_ it is therefore a quite correct fundamental proposition,
9200: that for that connexion of things according to final causes which is
9201: so plain, there must be thought a causality distinct from that of
9202: mechanism, viz. that of an (intelligent) cause of the world acting in
9203: accordance with purposes; but _for the determinant Judgement_ this
9204: would be a hasty and unprovable proposition. In the first case it is a
9205: mere maxim of the Judgement, wherein the concept of that causality is
9206: a mere Idea, to which we by no means undertake to concede reality, but
9207: which we use as a guide to reflection, which remains thereby always
9208: open to all mechanical grounds of explanation and does not withdraw
9209: out of the world of Sense. In the second case the proposition would be
9210: an objective principle prescribed by Reason, to which the determinant
9211: Judgement must subject itself, whereby however it withdraws beyond the
9212: world of Sense into the transcendent and perhaps is led into error.
9213: 
9214: All appearance of an antinomy between the maxims of the proper
9215: physical (mechanical) and the teleological (technical) methods of
9216: explanation rests therefore on this; that we confuse a fundamental
9217: proposition of the reflective with one of the determinant Judgement,
9218: and the _autonomy_ of the first (which has mere subjective validity for
9219: our use of Reason in respect of particular empirical laws) with the
9220: _heteronomy_ of the second, which must regulate itself according to
9221: laws (universal or particular) given to it by the Understanding.
9222: 
9223: 
9224: § 72. _Of the different systems which deal with the purposiveness of
9225: nature_
9226: 
9227: No one has ever doubted the correctness of the proposition that
9228: judgement must be passed upon certain things of nature (organised
9229: beings) and their possibility in accordance with the concept of final
9230: causes, even if we only desire a _guiding thread_ to learn how to
9231: cognise their constitution through observation, without aspiring to an
9232: investigation into their first origin. The question therefore can only
9233: be: whether this fundamental proposition is merely subjectively valid,
9234: _i.e._ is a mere maxim of our Judgement; or whether it is an objective
9235: principle of nature, in accordance with which, apart from its mechanism
9236: (according to the mere laws of motion), quite a different kind of
9237: causality attaches to it, viz. that of final causes, under which these
9238: laws (of moving forces) stand only as intermediate causes.
9239: 
9240: We could leave this question or problem quite undecided and unsolved
9241: speculatively; because if we content ourselves with speculation
9242: within the bounds of mere natural knowledge, we have enough in these
9243: maxims for the study of nature and for the tracking out of its hidden
9244: secrets, as far as human powers reach. There is then indeed a certain
9245: presentiment of our Reason or a hint as it were given us by nature,
9246: that, by means of this concept of final causes, we go beyond nature,
9247: and could unite it to the highest point in the series of causes, if we
9248: were to abandon or at least to lay aside for a time the investigation
9249: of nature (although we may not have advanced far in it), and seek
9250: thenceforth to find out whither this stranger in natural science, viz.
9251: the concept of natural purposes, would lead us.
9252: 
9253: But here these undisputed maxims pass over into problems opening out
9254: a wide field for difficulties. Does purposive connexion in nature
9255: _prove_ a particular kind of causality? Or is it not rather, considered
9256: in itself and in accordance with objective principles, similar to the
9257: mechanism of nature, resting on one and the same ground? Only, as
9258: this ground in many natural products is often hidden too deep for our
9259: investigation, we make trial of a subjective principle, that of art,
9260: _i.e._ of causality according to Ideas, and we ascribe it to nature
9261: by analogy. This expedient succeeds in many cases, but seems in some
9262: to mislead, and in no case does it justify us in introducing into
9263: natural science a particular kind of operation quite distinct from the
9264: causality according to the mere mechanical laws of nature. We give
9265: the name of _Technic_ to the procedure (the causality) of nature, on
9266: account of the appearance of purpose that we find in its products; and
9267: we shall divide this into _designed_ (_technica intentionalis_) and
9268: _undesigned_ (_technica naturalis_). The first is meant to signify
9269: that the productive faculty of nature according to final causes must
9270: be taken for a particular kind of causality; the second that it is
9271: at bottom quite similar to the mechanism of nature, and that its
9272: contingent agreement with our artistic concepts and their rules should
9273: be explained as a mere subjective condition of judging it, and not,
9274: falsely, as a particular kind of natural production.
9275: 
9276: If we now speak of systems explanatory of nature in regard of final
9277: causes, it must be remarked that they all controvert each other
9278: dogmatically, _i.e._ as to objective principles of the possibility of
9279: things, whether there are causes which act designedly or whether they
9280: are quite without design. They do not dispute as to the subjective
9281: maxims, by which we merely judge of the causes of such purposive
9282: products. In this latter case _disparate_ principles could very well
9283: be unified; but in the former, contradictorily opposed laws annul each
9284: other and cannot subsist together.
9285: 
9286: There are two sorts of systems as to the Technic of nature, _i.e._
9287: its productive power in accordance with the rule of purposes; viz.
9288: _Idealism_ or _Realism_ of natural purposes. The first maintains that
9289: all purposiveness of nature is _undesigned_; the second that some (in
9290: organised beings) is _designed_. From this latter the hypothetical
9291: consequence can be deduced that the Technic of Nature, as concerns
9292: all its other products in reference to the whole of nature, is also
9293: designed, _i.e._ is a purpose.
9294: 
9295: (1) The _Idealism_ of purposiveness (I always understand here by
9296: this, objective purposiveness) is either that of the _casuality_ or
9297: the _fatality_ of the determination of nature in the purposive form
9298: of its products. The former principle treats of the reference of
9299: matter to the physical basis of its form, viz. the laws of motion;
9300: the second, its reference to the _hyperphysical_ basis of itself and
9301: of the whole of nature. The system of _casuality_ that is ascribed to
9302: _Epicurus_ or _Democritus_ is, taken literally, so plainly absurd
9303: that it need not detain us. Opposed to this is the system of fatality,
9304: of which _Spinoza_ is taken as the author, although it is much
9305: older according to all appearance. This, as it appeals to something
9306: supersensible to which our insight does not extend, is not so easy to
9307: controvert; but that is because its concept of the original Being is
9308: not possible to understand. But so much is clear, that on this theory
9309: the purposive combination in the world must be taken as undesigned;
9310: for although derived from an original Being, it is not derived from
9311: its Understanding or from any design on its part, but rather from
9312: the necessity of its nature and of the world-unity which emanates
9313: therefrom. Consequently the Fatalism of purposiveness is at the same
9314: time an Idealism.
9315: 
9316: (2) The _Realism_ of the purposiveness of nature is also either
9317: physical or hyperphysical. The _former_ bases the purposes in nature,
9318: by the analogy of a faculty acting with design, on the _life of matter_
9319: (either its own or the life of an inner principle in it, a world-soul)
9320: and is called _Hylozoism_. The _latter_ derives them from the original
9321: ground of the universe, as from an intelligent Being (originally
9322: living), who produces them with design, and is _Theism_.[112]
9323: 
9324: 
9325: § 73. _None of the above systems give what they pretend_
9326: 
9327: What do all these systems desire? They desire to explain our
9328: teleological judgements about nature, and they go so to work therewith
9329: that some deny their truth and, consequently, explain them as an
9330: Idealism of Nature (represented as Art); others recognise them as true,
9331: and promise to establish the possibility of a nature in accordance with
9332: the Idea of final causes.
9333: 
9334: (1) The systems which defend the Idealism of final causes in nature
9335: grant, it is true, on the one hand to their principle a causality in
9336: accordance with the laws of motion (through which [causality] natural
9337: things exist purposively); but they deny to it _intentionality_, _i.e._
9338: that it designedly determines itself to this its purposive production;
9339: in other words, they deny that the cause is a purpose. This is
9340: _Epicurus’s_ method of explanation, according to which the distinction
9341: between a Technic of nature and mere mechanism is altogether denied.
9342: Blind chance is taken as the explanatory ground not only of the
9343: agreement of the developed products with our concepts of the purpose,
9344: and consequently of [nature’s] Technic; but also of the determination
9345: of the causes of this production in accordance with the laws of motion,
9346: and consequently of their mechanism. Thus nothing is explained, not
9347: even the illusion in our teleological judgements, and consequently, the
9348: would-be Idealism of these in no way established.
9349: 
9350: On the other hand, _Spinoza_ wishes to dispense with all inquiries into
9351: the ground of the possibility of purposes of nature, and to take away
9352: all reality from this Idea. He allows their validity in general not as
9353: products but as accidents inhering in an original Being; and to this
9354: Being, as substrate of those natural things, he ascribes not causality
9355: in regard to them but mere subsistence. On account of its unconditioned
9356: necessity, and also that of all natural things as accidents inhering
9357: in it, he secures, it is true, to the forms of nature that unity of
9358: ground which is requisite for all purposiveness; but at the same time
9359: he tears away their contingence, without which no _unity of purpose_
9360: can be thought, and with it all _design_, inasmuch as he takes away all
9361: intelligence from the original ground of natural things.
9362: 
9363: But Spinozism does not furnish what it desires. It desires to afford
9364: an explanatory ground of the purposive connexion (which it does not
9365: deny) of the things of nature, and it merely speaks of the unity of the
9366: subject in which they all inhere. But even if we concede to it that
9367: the beings of the world exist in this way, such ontological unity is
9368: not therefore a _unity of purpose_, and does not make this in any way
9369: comprehensible. For this latter is a quite particular kind of unity
9370: which does not follow from the connexion of things (the beings of
9371: the world) in a subject (the original Being), but implies in itself
9372: reference to a _cause_ which has Understanding; and even if we unite
9373: all these things in a simple subject, this never exhibits a purposive
9374: reference. For we do not think of them, first, as the inner _effects_
9375: of the substance, as if it were a _cause_; nor, secondly, of this
9376: cause as a cause producing effects _by means of its Understanding_.
9377: Without these formal conditions all unity is mere natural necessity;
9378: and, if it is ascribed as well to things which we represent as
9379: external to one another, blind necessity. But if we wish to give the
9380: name of purposiveness of nature to that which the schoolmen call the
9381: transcendental perfection of things (in reference to their proper
9382: being), according to which everything has in itself that which is
9383: requisite to make it one thing and not another, then we are only like
9384: children playing with words instead of concepts. For if all things
9385: must be thought as purposes, then to be a thing is the same as to be a
9386: purpose, and there is at bottom nothing which specially deserves to be
9387: represented as a purpose.
9388: 
9389: We hence see at once that Spinoza by his reducing our concepts of
9390: the purposive in nature to our own consciousness of existing in an
9391: all-embracing (though simple) Being, and by his seeking that form
9392: merely in the unity of this Being, must have intended to maintain not
9393: the realism, but the idealism of its purposiveness. Even this he was
9394: not able to accomplish, because the mere representation of the unity of
9395: the substrate cannot bring about the Idea of a purposiveness, even that
9396: which is only undesigned.
9397: 
9398: (2) Those who not only maintain the _Realism_ of natural purposes, but
9399: also set about explaining it, believe that they can comprehend, at
9400: least as regards its possibility, a practical kind of causality, viz.
9401: that of causes working designedly; otherwise they could not undertake
9402: to supply this explanation. For to authorise even the most daring of
9403: hypotheses, at least the _possibility_ of what we assume as basis must
9404: be _certain_, and we must be able to assure objective reality to its
9405: concept.
9406: 
9407: But the possibility of living matter cannot even be thought; its
9408: concept involves a contradiction because lifelessness, _inertia_,
9409: constitutes the essential character of matter. The possibility of
9410: matter endowed with life, and of collective nature regarded as an
9411: animal, can only be used in an inadequate way (in the interests of
9412: the hypothesis of purposiveness in the whole of nature), so far as it
9413: is manifested by experience in the organisation of nature on a small
9414: scale; but in no way can we have insight into its possibility _a
9415: priori_. There must then be a circle in the explanation, if we wish to
9416: derive the purposiveness of nature in organised beings from the life
9417: of matter, and yet only know this life in organised beings, and can
9418: form no concept of its possibility without experience of this kind.
9419: Hylozoism, therefore, does not furnish what it promises.
9420: 
9421: Finally, _Theism_ can just as little establish dogmatically the
9422: possibility of natural purposes as a key to Teleology; although it
9423: certainly is superior to all other grounds of explanation in that,
9424: through the Understanding which it ascribes to the original Being, it
9425: rescues in the best way the purposiveness of nature from Idealism, and
9426: introduces a causality acting with design for its production.
9427: 
9428: But we must first prove satisfactorily to the determinant Judgement the
9429: impossibility of the unity of purpose in matter resulting from its mere
9430: mechanism, before we are justified in placing the ground of this beyond
9431: nature in a determinate way. We can, however, advance no further than
9432: this. In accordance with the constitution and limits of our cognitive
9433: faculties (whilst we do not comprehend even the first inner ground
9434: of this mechanism) we must in no wise seek in matter a principle of
9435: determinate purposive references; but no other way of judging of the
9436: origination of its products as natural purposes remains to us than
9437: that by means of a supreme Understanding as cause of the world. But
9438: this is only a ground for the reflective, not for the determinant
9439: Judgement, and can justify absolutely no objective assertion.
9440: 
9441: 
9442: § 74. _The reason that we cannot treat the concept of a Technic of
9443: nature dogmatically is the fact that a natural purpose is inexplicable_
9444: 
9445: We deal with a concept dogmatically (even though it should be
9446: empirically conditioned) if we consider it as contained under another
9447: concept of the Object which constitutes a principle[113] of Reason,
9448: and determine it in conformity with this. But we deal with it merely
9449: critically, if we consider it only in reference to our cognitive
9450: faculties and consequently to the subjective conditions of thinking
9451: it, without undertaking to decide anything about its Object. Dogmatic
9452: procedure with a concept is then that which is conformable to law
9453: for the determinant Judgement, critical procedure for the reflective
9454: Judgement.
9455: 
9456: Now the concept of a thing as a natural purpose is a concept which
9457: subsumes nature under a causality only thinkable through Reason,
9458: in order to judge in accordance with this principle about that
9459: which is given of the Object in experience. But in order to use it
9460: dogmatically for the determinant Judgement, we must be assured first
9461: of the objective reality of this concept, because otherwise we could
9462: subsume no natural thing under it. Again, the concept of a thing as
9463: a natural purpose is, no doubt, empirically conditioned, _i.e._ only
9464: possible under certain conditions given in experience, though not to be
9465: abstracted therefrom; but it is a concept only possible in accordance
9466: with a rational principle in the judgement about the object. Its
9467: objective reality, therefore (_i.e._ that an object in conformity with
9468: it is possible), cannot be comprehended and dogmatically established as
9469: such a principle; and we do not know whether it is merely a sophistical
9470: and objectively empty concept (_conceptus ratiocinans_), or a rational
9471: concept, establishing a cognition and confirmed by Reason (_conceptus
9472: ratiocinatus_).[114] Therefore it cannot be dogmatically treated for
9473: the determinant Judgement, _i.e._ it is not only impossible to decide
9474: whether or not things of nature considered as natural purposes require
9475: for their production a causality of a quite peculiar kind (that acting
9476: on design); but the question cannot even be put, because the concept of
9477: a natural purpose is simply not susceptible of proof through Reason as
9478: regards its objective reality. That is, it is not constitutive for the
9479: determinant Judgement, but merely regulative for the reflective.
9480: 
9481: That it is not susceptible of proof is clear because (as concept of
9482: a _natural product_) it embraces in itself natural necessity, and at
9483: the same time (as purpose) a contingency of the form of the Object (in
9484: reference to the mere laws of nature) in the very same thing. Hence,
9485: if there is to be no contradiction here it must contain a ground for
9486: the possibility of the thing in nature, and also a ground of the
9487: possibility of this nature itself and of its reference to something
9488: which, not being empirically cognisable nature (supersensible), is
9489: therefore for us not cognisable at all. [This is requisite] if it is
9490: to be judged according to a different kind of causality from that
9491: of natural mechanism when we wish to establish its possibility. The
9492: concept of a thing, then, as a natural purpose, is transcendent _for
9493: the determinant Judgement_, if we consider the Object through Reason
9494: (although for the reflective Judgement it certainly may be immanent in
9495: respect of the objects of experience). Hence for determinant judgements
9496: objective reality cannot be supplied to it; and so it is intelligible
9497: how all systems that one may project for the dogmatic treatment of
9498: the concept of natural purposes and of nature itself [considered]
9499: as a whole connected together by means of final causes, can decide
9500: nothing either by objective affirmation or by objective denial. For if
9501: things be subsumed under a concept that is merely problematical, its
9502: synthetical predicates (_e.g._ in the question whether the purpose of
9503: nature which we conceive for the production of things is designed or
9504: undesigned) can furnish only problematical judgements of the Object,
9505: whether affirmative or negative; and we do not know whether we are
9506: judging about something or about nothing. The concept of a causality
9507: through purposes (of art) has at all events objective reality, and
9508: also the concept of a causality according to the mechanism of nature.
9509: But the concept of a causality of nature according to the rule of
9510: purposes,--still more of a Being such as cannot be given us in
9511: experience, a Being who is the original cause of nature,--though it
9512: can be thought without contradiction, yet is of no avail for dogmatic
9513: determinations. For, since it cannot be derived from experience,
9514: and also is not requisite for the possibility thereof, its objective
9515: reality can in no way be assured. But even if this could be done, how
9516: can I number among the products of nature things which are definitely
9517: accounted products of divine art, when it is just the incapacity of
9518: nature to produce such things according to its own laws that made it
9519: necessary to invoke a cause different from it?
9520: 
9521: 
9522: § 75. _The concept of an objective purposiveness of nature is a
9523: critical principle of Reason for the reflective Judgement_
9524: 
9525: It is then one thing to say, “the production of certain things of
9526: nature or that of collective nature is only possible through a cause
9527: which determines itself to action according to design”; and quite
9528: another to say, “I can _according to the peculiar constitution of my
9529: cognitive faculties_ judge concerning the possibility of these things
9530: and their production, in no other fashion than by conceiving for this a
9531: cause working according to design, _i.e._ a Being which is productive
9532: in a way analogous to the causality of an intelligence.” In the former
9533: case I wish to establish something concerning the Object, and am
9534: bound to establish the objective reality of an assumed concept; in
9535: the latter, Reason only determines the use of my cognitive faculties,
9536: conformably to their peculiarities and to the essential conditions
9537: of their range and their limits. Thus the former principle is an
9538: objective proposition for the determinant Judgement, the latter merely
9539: a subjective proposition for the reflective Judgement, _i.e._ a maxim
9540: which Reason prescribes to it.
9541: 
9542: We are in fact indispensably obliged to ascribe the concept of design
9543: to nature if we wish to investigate it, though only in its organised
9544: products, by continuous observation; and this concept is therefore an
9545: absolutely necessary maxim for the empirical use of our Reason. It
9546: is plain that once such a guiding thread for the study of nature is
9547: admitted and verified, we must at least try the said maxim of Judgement
9548: in nature as a whole; because thereby many of nature’s laws might
9549: discover themselves, which otherwise, on account of the limitation
9550: of our insight into its inner mechanism, would remain hidden. But
9551: though in regard to this latter employment that maxim of Judgement is
9552: certainly useful, it is not indispensable, for nature as a whole is not
9553: given as organised (in the narrow sense of the word above indicated).
9554: On the other hand, in regard to those natural products, which must
9555: be judged of as designed and not formed otherwise (if we are to have
9556: empirical knowledge of their inner constitution), this maxim of the
9557: reflective Judgement is essentially necessary; because the very thought
9558: of them as organised beings is impossible without combining therewith
9559: the thought of their designed production.
9560: 
9561: Now the concept of a thing whose existence or form we represent to
9562: ourselves as possible under the condition of a purpose is inseparably
9563: bound up with the concept of its contingency (according to natural
9564: laws). Hence the natural things that we find possible only as purposes
9565: supply the best proof of the contingency of the world-whole; to the
9566: common Understanding and to the philosopher alike they are the only
9567: valid ground of proof for its dependence on and origin from a Being
9568: existing outside the world--a Being who must also be intelligent on
9569: account of that purposive form. Teleology then finds the consummation
9570: of its investigations only in Theology.
9571: 
9572: But what now in the end does the most complete Teleology prove? Does
9573: it prove that there is such an intelligent Being? No. It only proves
9574: that according to the constitution of our cognitive faculties and in
9575: the consequent combination of experience with the highest principles of
9576: Reason, we can form absolutely no concept of the possibility of such a
9577: world [as this] save by thinking a _designedly-working_ supreme cause
9578: thereof. Objectively we cannot therefore lay down the proposition,
9579: there is an intelligent original Being; but only subjectively, for the
9580: use of our Judgement in its reflection upon the purposes in nature,
9581: which can be thought according to no other principle than that of a
9582: designing causality of a highest cause.
9583: 
9584: If we wished to establish on teleological grounds the above proposition
9585: dogmatically we should be beset with difficulties from which we could
9586: not extricate ourselves. For then the proposition must at bottom be
9587: reduced to the conclusion, that the organised beings in the world
9588: are no otherwise possible than by a designedly-working cause. And we
9589: should unavoidably have to assert that, because we can follow up these
9590: things in their causal combination only under the Idea of purposes, and
9591: cognise them only according to their conformity to law, we are thereby
9592: justified in assuming this as a condition necessary for every thinking
9593: and cognising being--a condition consequently attaching to the Object
9594: and not merely to our subject. But such an assertion we do not succeed
9595: in sustaining. For, since we do not, properly speaking, _observe_ the
9596: purposes in nature as designed, but only in our reflection upon its
9597: products _think_ this concept as a guiding thread for our Judgement,
9598: they are not given to us through the Object. It is quite impossible for
9599: us _a priori_ to vindicate, as capable of assumption, such a concept
9600: according to its objective reality. It remains therefore a proposition
9601: absolutely resting upon subjective conditions alone, viz. of the
9602: Judgement reflecting in conformity with our cognitive faculties. If
9603: we expressed this proposition dogmatically as objectively valid, it
9604: would be: “There is a God.” But for us men there is only permissible
9605: the limited formula: “We cannot otherwise think and make comprehensible
9606: the purposiveness which must lie at the bottom of our cognition of
9607: the internal possibility of many natural things, than by representing
9608: it and the world in general as a product of an intelligent cause, [a
9609: God].”[115]
9610: 
9611: Now if this proposition, based on an inevitably necessary maxim of our
9612: Judgement, is completely satisfactory from every _human_ point of view
9613: for both the speculative and practical use of our Reason, I should like
9614: to know what we lose by not being able to prove it as also valid for
9615: higher beings, from objective grounds (which unfortunately are beyond
9616: our faculties). It is indeed quite certain that we cannot adequately
9617: cognise, much less explain, organised beings and their internal
9618: possibility, according to mere mechanical principles of nature; and we
9619: can say boldly it is alike certain that it is absurd for men to make
9620: any such attempt or to hope that another _Newton_ will arise in the
9621: future, who shall make comprehensible by us the production of a blade
9622: of grass according to natural laws which no design has ordered.[116]
9623: We must absolutely deny this insight to men. But then how do we know
9624: that in nature, if we could penetrate to the principle by which it
9625: specifies the universal laws known to us, there _cannot_ lie hidden (in
9626: its mere mechanism) a sufficient ground of the possibility of organised
9627: beings without supposing any design in their production? would it
9628: not be judged by us presumptuous to say this? Probabilities here are
9629: of no account when we have to do with judgements of pure Reason.--We
9630: cannot therefore judge objectively, either affirmatively or negatively,
9631: concerning the proposition: “Does a Being acting according to design
9632: lie at the basis of what we rightly call natural purposes, as the cause
9633: of the world (and consequently as its author)?” So much only is sure,
9634: that if we are to judge according to what is permitted us to see by
9635: our own proper nature (the conditions and limitations of our Reason),
9636: we can place at the basis of the possibility of these natural purposes
9637: nothing else than an intelligent Being. This alone is in conformity
9638: with the maxim of our reflective Judgement and therefore with a ground
9639: which, though subjective, is inseparably attached to the human race.
9640: 
9641: 
9642: § 76. _Remark_
9643: 
9644: This consideration, which very well deserves to be worked out in
9645: detail in Transcendental Philosophy, can come in here only in passing,
9646: by way of elucidation (not as a proof of what is here proposed).
9647: 
9648: Reason is a faculty of principles and proceeds in its extremest advance
9649: to the unconditioned; on the other hand, the Understanding stands at
9650: its service always only under a certain condition which must be given.
9651: But without concepts of Understanding, to which objective reality
9652: must be given, the Reason cannot form any objective (synthetical)
9653: judgement; and contains in itself, as theoretical Reason, absolutely
9654: no constitutive but merely regulative principles. We soon see that
9655: where the Understanding cannot follow, the Reason is transcendent, and
9656: shows itself in Ideas formerly established (as regulative principles),
9657: but not in objectively valid concepts. But the Understanding which
9658: cannot keep pace with Reason but yet is requisite for the validity of
9659: Objects, limits the validity of these Ideas to the subject, although
9660: [extending it] generally to all [subjects] of this kind. That is, the
9661: Understanding limits their validity to the condition, that according
9662: to the nature of our (human) cognitive faculties, or, generally,
9663: according to the concept which we _ourselves_ can _make_ of the faculty
9664: of a finite intelligent being, nothing else can or must be thought;
9665: though this is not to assert that the ground of such a judgement lies
9666: in the Object. We shall adduce some examples which, though they are
9667: too important and difficult to impose them on the reader as proved
9668: propositions, yet will give him material for thought and may serve to
9669: elucidate what we are here specially concerned with.
9670: 
9671: It is indispensably necessary for the human Understanding to
9672: distinguish between the possibility and the actuality of things. The
9673: ground for this lies in the subject and in the nature of our cognitive
9674: faculties. Such a distinction (between the possible and the actual)
9675: would not be given were there not requisite for knowledge two quite
9676: different elements, Understanding for concepts and sensible intuition
9677: for Objects corresponding to them. If our Understanding were intuitive
9678: it would have no objects but those which are actual. Concepts (which
9679: merely extend to the possibility of an object) and sensible intuitions
9680: (which give us something without allowing us to cognise it thus as an
9681: object) would both disappear. But now the whole of our distinction
9682: between the merely possible and the actual rests on this, that the
9683: former only signifies the positing of the representation of a thing
9684: in respect of our concept, and, in general, in respect of the faculty
9685: of thought; while the latter signifies the positing of the thing in
9686: itself [outside this concept].[117] The distinction, then, of possible
9687: things from actual is one which has merely subjective validity for the
9688: human Understanding, because we can always have a thing in our thoughts
9689: although it is [really] nothing, or we can represent a thing as given
9690: although we have no concept of it. The propositions therefore--that
9691: things can be possible without being actual, and that consequently no
9692: conclusion can be drawn as to actuality from mere possibility--are
9693: quite valid for human Reason, without thereby proving that this
9694: distinction lies in things themselves. That this does not follow, and
9695: that consequently these propositions, though valid of Objects (in
9696: so far as our cognitive faculty, as sensuously conditioned, busies
9697: itself with Objects of sense), do not hold for things in general,
9698: appears from the irrepressible demand of Reason to assume something
9699: (the original ground) necessarily existing as unconditioned, in which
9700: possibility and actuality should no longer be distinguished, and
9701: for which Idea our Understanding has absolutely no concept; _i.e._
9702: it can find no way of representing such a thing and its manner of
9703: existence. For if the Understanding _thinks_ such a thing (which it
9704: may do at pleasure), the thing is merely represented as possible. If
9705: it is conscious of it as given in intuition, then is it actual; but
9706: nothing as to its possibility is thus thought. Hence the concept of
9707: an absolutely necessary Being is no doubt an indispensable Idea of
9708: Reason, but yet it is a problematical concept unattainable by the human
9709: Understanding. It is indeed valid for the employment of our cognitive
9710: faculties in accordance with their peculiar constitution, but not
9711: valid of the Object. Nor is it valid for every knowing being, because
9712: I cannot presuppose in every such being thought and intuition as two
9713: distinct conditions of the exercise of its cognitive faculties, and
9714: consequently as conditions of the possibility and actuality of things.
9715: An Understanding into which this distinction did not enter, might
9716: say: All Objects that I know _are_, _i.e._ exist; and the possibility
9717: of some, which yet do not exist (_i.e._ the contingency or the
9718: contrasted necessity of those which do exist), might never come into
9719: the representation of such a being at all. But what makes it difficult
9720: for our Understanding to treat its concepts here as Reason does, is
9721: merely that for it, as human Understanding, that is transcendent
9722: (_i.e._ impossible for the subjective conditions of its cognition)
9723: which Reason makes into a principle appertaining to the Object.--Here
9724: the maxim always holds, that all Objects whose cognition surpasses
9725: the faculty of the Understanding are thought by us according to the
9726: subjective conditions of the exercise of that faculty which necessarily
9727: attach to our (human) nature. If judgements laid down in this way (and
9728: there is no other alternative in regard to transcendent concepts)
9729: cannot be constitutive principles determining the Object as it is, they
9730: will remain regulative principles adapted to the human point of view,
9731: immanent in their exercise and sure.
9732: 
9733: Just as Reason in the theoretical consideration of nature must assume
9734: the Idea of an unconditioned necessity of its original ground, so also
9735: it presupposes in the practical [sphere] its own (in respect of nature)
9736: unconditioned causality, or freedom, in that it is conscious of its
9737: own moral command. Here the objective necessity of the act, as a duty,
9738: is opposed to that necessity which it would have as an event, if its
9739: ground lay in nature and not in freedom (_i.e._ in the causality of
9740: Reason). The morally absolutely necessary act is regarded as physically
9741: quite contingent, since that which _ought_ necessarily to happen often
9742: does not happen. It is clear then that it is owing to the subjective
9743: constitution of our practical faculty that the moral laws must be
9744: represented as commands, and the actions conforming to them as duties;
9745: and that Reason expresses this necessity not by an “_is_” (happens),
9746: but by an “ought to be.” This would not be the case were Reason
9747: considered as in its causality independent of sensibility (as the
9748: subjective condition of its application to objects of nature), and so
9749: as cause in an intelligible world entirely in agreement with the moral
9750: law. For in such a world there would be no distinction between “ought
9751: to do” and “does,” between a practical law of that which is possible
9752: through us, and the theoretical law of that which is actual through
9753: us. Though, therefore, an intelligible world in which everything would
9754: be actual merely because (as something good) it is possible, together
9755: with freedom as its formal condition, is for us a transcendent concept,
9756: not available as a constitutive principle to determine an Object and
9757: its objective reality; yet, because of the constitution of our (in
9758: part sensuous) nature and faculty it is, so far as we can represent
9759: it in accordance with the constitution of our Reason, for us and for
9760: all rational beings that have a connexion with the world of sense, a
9761: universal _regulative principle_. This principle does not objectively
9762: determine the constitution of freedom, as a form of causality, but it
9763: makes the rule of actions according to that Idea a command for every
9764: one, with no less validity than if it did so determine it.
9765: 
9766: In the same way we may concede thus much as regards the case in hand.
9767: Between natural mechanism and the Technic of nature, _i.e._ its
9768: purposive connexion, we should find no distinction, were it not that
9769: our Understanding is of the kind that must proceed from the universal
9770: to the particular. The Judgement then in respect of the particular can
9771: cognise no purposiveness and, consequently, can form no determinant
9772: judgements, without having a universal law under which to subsume that
9773: particular. Now the particular, as such, contains something contingent
9774: in respect of the universal, while yet Reason requires unity and
9775: conformity to law in the combination of particular laws of nature.
9776: This conformity of the contingent to law is called purposiveness; and
9777: the derivation of particular laws from the universal, as regards their
9778: contingent element, is impossible _a priori_ through a determination
9779: of the concept of the Object. Hence, the concept of the purposiveness
9780: of nature in its products is necessary for human Judgement in respect
9781: of nature, but has not to do with the determination of Objects. It is,
9782: therefore, a subjective principle of Reason for the Judgement, which
9783: as regulative (not constitutive) is just as necessarily valid for our
9784: _human Judgement_ as if it were an objective principle.
9785: 
9786: 
9787: § 77. _Of the peculiarity of the human Understanding, by means of which
9788: the concept of a natural purpose is possible_
9789: 
9790: We have brought forward in the _Remark_ peculiarities of our cognitive
9791: faculties (even the higher ones) which we are easily led to transfer as
9792: objective predicates to the things themselves. But they concern Ideas,
9793: no object adequate to which can be given in experience, and they could
9794: only serve as regulative principles in the pursuit of experience. This
9795: is the case with the concept of a natural purpose, which concerns the
9796: cause of the possibility of such a predicate, which cause can only lie
9797: in the Idea. But the result corresponding to it (_i.e._ the product)
9798: is given in nature; and the concept of a causality of nature as of a
9799: being acting according to purposes seems to make the Idea of a natural
9800: purpose into a constitutive principle, which Idea has thus something
9801: different from all other Ideas.
9802: 
9803: This difference consists, however, in the fact that the Idea in
9804: question is not a rational principle for the Understanding but
9805: for the Judgement. It is, therefore, merely the application of an
9806: Understanding in general to possible objects of experience, in cases
9807: where the judgement can only be reflective, not determinant, and where,
9808: consequently, the object, although given in experience, cannot be
9809: _determinately judged_ in conformity with the Idea (not to say with
9810: complete adequacy), but can only be reflected on.
9811: 
9812: There emerges, therefore, a peculiarity of _our_ (human) Understanding
9813: in respect of the Judgement in its reflection upon things of nature.
9814: But if this be so, the Idea of a possible Understanding different
9815: from the human must be fundamental here. (Just so in the Critique
9816: of Pure Reason we must have in our thoughts another possible [kind
9817: of] intuition, if ours is to be regarded as a particular species
9818: for which objects are only valid as phenomena.) And so we are able
9819: to say: Certain natural products, from the special constitution of
9820: our Understanding, _must be considered by us_, in regard to their
9821: possibility, as if produced designedly and as purposes. But we
9822: do not, therefore, demand that there should be actually given a
9823: particular cause which has the representation of a purpose as its
9824: determining ground; and we do not deny that an Understanding, different
9825: from (_i.e._ higher than) the human, might find the ground of the
9826: possibility of such products of nature in the mechanism of nature,
9827: _i.e._ in a causal combination for which an Understanding is not
9828: explicitly assumed as cause.
9829: 
9830: We have now to do with the relation of _our_ Understanding to the
9831: Judgement; viz. we seek for a certain contingency in the constitution
9832: of our Understanding, to which we may point as a peculiarity
9833: distinguishing it from other possible Understandings.
9834: 
9835: This contingency is found, naturally enough, in the _particular_,
9836: which the Judgement is to bring under the _universal_ of the concepts
9837: of Understanding. For the universal of _our_ (human) Understanding does
9838: not determine the particular, and it is contingent in how many ways
9839: different things which agree in a common characteristic may come before
9840: our perception. Our Understanding is a faculty of concepts, _i.e._ a
9841: discursive Understanding, for which it obviously must be contingent
9842: of what kind and how very different the particular may be that can be
9843: given to it in nature and brought under its concepts. But now intuition
9844: also belongs to knowledge, and a faculty of a _complete spontaneity
9845: of intuition_ would be a cognitive faculty distinct from sensibility,
9846: and quite independent of it, in other words, an Understanding in the
9847: most general sense. Thus we can think an _intuitive_ Understanding
9848: [negatively, merely as not discursive[118]], which does not proceed
9849: from the universal to the particular, and so to the individual (through
9850: concepts). For it that contingency of the accordance of nature in its
9851: products according to _particular_ laws with the Understanding would
9852: not be met with; and it is this contingency that makes it so hard for
9853: our Understanding to reduce the manifold of nature to the unity of
9854: knowledge. This reduction our Understanding can only accomplish by
9855: bringing natural characteristics into a very contingent correspondence
9856: with our faculty of concepts, of which an intuitive Understanding would
9857: have no need.
9858: 
9859: Our Understanding has then this peculiarity as concerns the Judgement,
9860: that in cognition by it the particular is not determined by the
9861: universal and cannot therefore be derived from it; but at the same
9862: time this particular in the manifold of nature must accord with the
9863: universal (by means of concepts and laws) so that it may be capable
9864: of being subsumed under it. This accordance under such circumstances
9865: must be very contingent and without definite principle as concerns the
9866: Judgement.
9867: 
9868: In order now to be able at least to think the possibility of such an
9869: accordance of things of nature with our Judgement (which accordance
9870: we represent as contingent and consequently as only possible by means
9871: of a purpose directed thereto), we must at the same time think of
9872: another Understanding, by reference to which and apart from any purpose
9873: ascribed to it, we may represent as _necessary_ that accordance of
9874: natural laws with our Judgement, which for our Understanding is only
9875: thinkable through the medium of purposes.
9876: 
9877: In fact our Understanding has the property of proceeding in
9878: its cognition, _e.g._ of the cause of a product, from the
9879: _analytical-universal_ (concepts) to the particular (the given
9880: empirical intuition). Thus as regards the manifold of the latter it
9881: determines nothing, but must await this determination by the Judgement,
9882: which subsumes the empirical intuition (if the object is a natural
9883: product) under the concept. We can however think an Understanding
9884: which, being, not like ours, discursive, but intuitive, proceeds from
9885: the _synthetical-universal_ (the intuition of a whole as such) to the
9886: particular, _i.e._ from the whole to the parts. The _contingency_
9887: of the combination of the parts, in order that a definite form of
9888: the whole shall be possible, is not implied by such an Understanding
9889: and its representation of the whole. Our Understanding requires this
9890: because it must proceed from the parts as universally conceived
9891: grounds to different forms possible to be subsumed under them, as
9892: consequences. According to the constitution of our Understanding a
9893: real whole of nature is regarded only as the effect of the concurrent
9894: motive powers of the parts. Suppose then that we wish not to represent
9895: the possibility of the whole as dependent on that of the parts (after
9896: the manner of our discursive Understanding), but according to the
9897: standard of the intuitive (original) Understanding to represent
9898: the possibility of the parts (according to their constitution and
9899: combination) as dependent on that of the whole. In accordance with the
9900: above peculiarity of our Understanding it cannot happen that the whole
9901: shall contain the ground of the possibility of the connexion of the
9902: parts (which would be a contradiction in discursive cognition), but
9903: only that the _representation_ of a whole may contain the ground of the
9904: possibility of its form and the connexion of the parts belonging to it.
9905: Now such a whole would be an effect (_product_) the _representation_ of
9906: which is regarded as the _cause_ of its possibility; but the product
9907: of a cause whose determining ground is merely the representation of
9908: its effect is called a purpose. Hence it is merely a consequence of
9909: the particular constitution of our Understanding, that it represents
9910: products of nature as possible, according to a different kind of
9911: causality from that of the natural laws of matter, namely, that of
9912: purposes and final causes. Hence also this principle has not to do
9913: with the possibility of such things themselves (even when considered
9914: as phenomena) according to the manner of their production, but merely
9915: with the judgement upon them which is possible to our Understanding.
9916: Here we see at once why it is that in natural science we are not
9917: long contented with an explanation of the products of nature by a
9918: causality according to purposes. For there we desire to judge of
9919: natural production merely in a manner conformable to our faculty of
9920: judging, _i.e._ to the reflective Judgement, and not in reference to
9921: things themselves on behalf of the determinant Judgement. It is here
9922: not at all requisite to prove that such an _intellectus archetypus_ is
9923: possible, but only that we are led to the Idea of it,--which contains
9924: no contradiction,--in contrast to our discursive Understanding which
9925: has need of images (_intellectus ectypus_) and to the contingency of
9926: its constitution.
9927: 
9928: If we consider a material whole, according to its form, as a product
9929: of the parts with their powers and faculties of combining with one
9930: another (as well as of bringing in foreign materials), we represent to
9931: ourselves a mechanical mode of producing it. But in this way no concept
9932: emerges of a whole as purpose, whose internal possibility presupposes
9933: throughout the Idea of a whole on which depend the constitution and
9934: mode of action of the parts, as we must represent to ourselves an
9935: organised body. It does not follow indeed, as has been shown, that
9936: the mechanical production of such a body is impossible; for to say so
9937: would be to say that it would be impossible (contradictory) for _any
9938: Understanding_ to represent to itself such a unity in the connexion of
9939: the manifold, without the Idea of the unity being at the same time its
9940: producing cause, _i.e._ without designed production. This, however,
9941: would follow in fact if we were justified in regarding material beings
9942: as things in themselves. For then the unity that constitutes the
9943: ground of the possibility of natural formations would be simply the
9944: unity of space. But space is no real ground of the products, but only
9945: their formal condition, although it has this similarity to the real
9946: ground which we seek that in it no part can be determined except in
9947: relation to the whole (the representation of which therefore lies at
9948: the ground of the possibility of the parts). But now it is at least
9949: possible to consider the material world as mere phenomenon, and to
9950: think as its substrate something like a thing in itself (which is
9951: not phenomenon), and to attach to this a corresponding intellectual
9952: intuition (even though it is not ours). Thus there would be, although
9953: incognisable by us, a supersensible real ground for nature, to which
9954: we ourselves belong. In this we consider according to mechanical laws
9955: what is necessary in nature regarded as an object of Sense; but we
9956: consider according to teleological laws the agreement and unity of its
9957: particular laws and its forms--which in regard to mechanism we must
9958: judge contingent--regarded as objects of Reason (in fact the whole
9959: of nature as a system). Thus we should judge nature according to two
9960: different kinds of principles without the mechanical way of explanation
9961: being shut out by the teleological, as if they contradicted one another.
9962: 
9963: From this we are enabled to see what otherwise, though we could easily
9964: surmise it, could with difficulty be maintained with certainty and
9965: proved, viz. that the principle of a mechanical derivation of purposive
9966: natural products is consistent with the teleological, but in no way
9967: enables us to dispense with it. In a thing that we must judge as a
9968: natural purpose (an organised being) we can no doubt try all the known
9969: and yet to be discovered laws of mechanical production, and even hope
9970: to make good progress therewith; but we can never get rid of the call
9971: for a quite different ground of production for the possibility of such
9972: a product, viz. causality by means of purposes. Absolutely no human
9973: Reason (in fact no finite Reason like ours in quality, however much it
9974: may surpass it in degree) can hope to understand the production of even
9975: a blade of grass by mere mechanical causes. As regards the possibility
9976: of such an object, the teleological connexion of causes and effects
9977: is quite indispensable for the Judgement, even for studying it by the
9978: clue of experience. For external objects as phenomena an adequate
9979: ground related to purposes cannot be met with; this, although it lies
9980: in nature, must only be sought in the supersensible substrate of
9981: nature, from all possible insight into which we are cut off. Hence it
9982: is absolutely impossible for us to produce from nature itself grounds
9983: of explanation for purposive combinations; and it is necessary by the
9984: constitution of the human cognitive faculties to seek the supreme
9985: ground of these purposive combinations in an original Understanding as
9986: the cause of the world.

9989: § 78. _Of the union of the principle of the universal mechanism of
9990: matter with the teleological principle in the Technic of nature_
9991: 
9992: It is infinitely important for Reason not to let slip the mechanism
9993: of nature in its products, and in their explanation not to pass it
9994: by, because without it no insight into the nature of things can be
9995: attained. Suppose it admitted that a supreme Architect immediately
9996: created the forms of nature as they have been from the beginning, or
9997: that He predetermined those which in the course of nature continually
9998: form themselves on the same model. Our knowledge of nature is not thus
9999: in the least furthered, because we cannot know the mode of action of
10000: that Being and the Ideas which are to contain the principles of the
10001: possibility of natural beings, and we cannot by them explain nature
10002: as from above downwards (_a priori_). And if, starting from the forms
10003: of the objects of experience, from below upwards (_a posteriori_),
10004: we wish to explain the purposiveness, which we believe is met with
10005: in experience, by appealing to a cause working in accordance with
10006: purposes, then is our explanation quite tautological and we are only
10007: mocking Reason with words. Indeed when we lose ourselves with this way
10008: of explanation in the transcendent, whither natural knowledge cannot
10009: follow, Reason is seduced into poetical extravagance, which it is its
10010: peculiar destination to avoid.
10011: 
10012: On the other hand, it is just as necessary a maxim of Reason not
10013: to pass by the principle of purposes in the products of nature.
10014: For, although it does not make their mode of origination any more
10015: comprehensible, yet it is a heuristic principle for investigating the
10016: particular laws of nature; supposing even that we wish to make no use
10017: of it for explaining nature itself,--in which we still always speak
10018: only of natural purposes, although it apparently exhibits a designed
10019: unity of purpose,--_i.e._ without seeking beyond nature the ground of
10020: the possibility of these particular laws. But since we must come in
10021: the end to this latter question, it is just as necessary to think for
10022: nature a particular kind of causality which does not present itself in
10023: it, as the mechanism of natural causes which does. To the receptivity
10024: of several forms, different from those of which matter is susceptible
10025: by mechanism, must be added a spontaneity of a cause (which therefore
10026: cannot be matter), without which no ground can be assigned for those
10027: forms. No doubt Reason, before it takes this step, must proceed with
10028: caution, and not try to explain teleologically every Technic of nature,
10029: _i.e._ every productive faculty of nature which displays in itself (as
10030: in regular bodies) purposiveness of figure to our mere apprehension;
10031: but must always regard such as so far mechanically possible. But on
10032: that account to wish entirely to exclude the teleological principle,
10033: and to follow simple mechanism only--in cases where, in the rational
10034: investigation of the possibility of natural forms through their causes,
10035: purposiveness shows itself quite undeniably as the reference to a
10036: different kind of causality--to do this must make Reason fantastic, and
10037: send it wandering among chimeras of unthinkable natural faculties; just
10038: as a mere teleological mode of explanation which takes no account of
10039: natural mechanism makes it visionary.
10040: 
10041: In the same natural thing both principles cannot be connected as
10042: fundamental propositions of explanation (deduction) of one by the
10043: other, _i.e._ they do not unite for the determinant Judgement as
10044: dogmatical and constitutive principles of insight into nature. If I
10045: choose, _e.g._ to regard a maggot as the product of the mere mechanism
10046: of nature (of the new formation that it produces of itself, when
10047: its elements are set free by corruption), I cannot derive the same
10048: product from the same matter as from a causality that acts according
10049: to purposes. Conversely, if I regard the same product as a natural
10050: purpose, I cannot count on any mechanical mode of its production and
10051: regard this as the constitutive principle of my judgement upon its
10052: possibility, and so unite both principles. One method of explanation
10053: excludes the other; even supposing that objectively both grounds of
10054: the possibility of such a product rested on a single ground, to which
10055: we did not pay attention. The principle which should render possible
10056: the compatibility of both in judging of nature must be placed in
10057: that which lies outside both (and consequently outside the possible
10058: empirical representation of nature), but yet contains their ground,
10059: _i.e._ in the supersensible; and each of the two methods of explanation
10060: must be referred thereto. Now of this we can have no concept but the
10061: indeterminate concept of a ground, which makes the judging of nature
10062: by empirical laws possible, but which we cannot determine more nearly
10063: by any predicate. Hence the union of both principles cannot rest upon
10064: a ground of _explanation_ of the possibility of a product according to
10065: given laws, for the _determinant_ Judgement, but only upon a ground
10066: of its _exposition_ for the _reflective_ Judgement.--To explain is to
10067: derive from a principle, which therefore we must clearly know and of
10068: which we can give an account. No doubt the principle of the mechanism
10069: of nature and that of its causality in one and the same natural product
10070: must coalesce in a single higher principle, which is their common
10071: source, because otherwise they could not subsist side by side in the
10072: observation of nature. But if this principle, objectively common to
10073: the two, which therefore warrants the association of the maxims of
10074: natural investigation depending on both, be such that, though it
10075: can be pointed to, it cannot be determinately known nor clearly put
10076: forward for use in cases which arise, then from such a principle we
10077: can draw no explanation, _i.e._ no clear and determinate derivation
10078: of the possibility of a natural product in accordance with those
10079: two heterogeneous principles. But now the principle common to the
10080: mechanical and teleological derivations is the _supersensible_, which
10081: we must place at the basis of nature, regarded as phenomenon. And of
10082: this, in a theoretical point of view, we cannot form the smallest
10083: positive determinate concept. It cannot, therefore, in any way be
10084: explained how, according to it as principle, nature (in its particular
10085: laws) constitutes for us one system, which can be cognised as possible
10086: either by the principle of physical development or by that of final
10087: causes. If it happens that objects of nature present themselves which
10088: cannot be thought by us, as regards their possibility, according to
10089: the principle of mechanism (which always has a claim on a natural
10090: being), without relying on teleological propositions, we can only make
10091: an hypothesis. Namely, we suppose that we may hopefully investigate
10092: natural laws with reference to both (according as the possibility of
10093: its product is cognisable by our Understanding by one or the other
10094: principle), without stumbling at the apparent contradiction which comes
10095: into view between the principles by which they are judged. For at least
10096: the possibility is assured that both may be united objectively in one
10097: principle, since they concern phenomena that presuppose a supersensible
10098: ground.
10099: 
10100: Mechanism, then, and the teleological (designed) Technic of nature,
10101: in respect of the same product and its possibility, may stand under
10102: a common supreme principle of nature in particular laws. But since
10103: this principle is _transcendent_ we cannot, because of the limitation
10104: of our Understanding, unite both principles _in the explanation_ of
10105: the same production of nature even if the inner possibility of this
10106: product is only _intelligible_ [verständlich] through a causality
10107: according to purposes (as is the case with organised matter). We
10108: revert then to the above fundamental proposition of Teleology.
10109: According to the constitution of the human Understanding, no other
10110: than designedly-working causes can be assumed for the possibility of
10111: organised beings in nature; and the mere mechanism of nature cannot
10112: be adequate to the explanation of these its products. But we do not
10113: attempt to decide anything by this fundamental proposition as to the
10114: possibility of such things themselves.
10115: 
10116: This is only a maxim of the reflective, not of the determinant
10117: Judgement; consequently only subjectively valid for us, not objectively
10118: for the possibility of things themselves of this kind (in which both
10119: kinds of production may well cohere in one and the same ground).
10120: Further, without any concept,--besides the teleologically conceived
10121: method of production,--of a simultaneously presented mechanism of
10122: nature, no judgement can be passed on this kind of production as a
10123: natural product. Hence the above maxim leads to the necessity of
10124: an unification of both principles in judging of things as natural
10125: purposes in themselves, but does not lead us to substitute one for
10126: the other either altogether or in certain parts. For in the place of
10127: what is thought (at least by us) as possible only by design we cannot
10128: set mechanism, and in the place of what is cognised as mechanically
10129: necessary we cannot set contingency, which would need a purpose as its
10130: determining ground; but we can only subordinate the one (Mechanism)
10131: to the other (designed Technic), which may quite well be the case
10132: according to the transcendental principle of the purposiveness of
10133: nature.
10134: 
10135: For where purposes are thought as grounds of the possibility of certain
10136: things, we must assume also means, whose law of working requires _for
10137: itself_ nothing presupposing a purpose,--a mechanical law--and yet
10138: can be a subordinate cause of designed effects. Thus--in the organic
10139: products of nature, and specially when prompted by their infinite
10140: number, we assume (at least as a permissible hypothesis) design in
10141: the combination of natural causes by particular laws as a _universal
10142: principle_ of the reflective Judgement for the whole of nature (the
10143: world),--we can think a great and indeed universal combination of
10144: mechanical with teleological laws in the productions of nature, without
10145: interchanging the principles by which they are judged or putting one
10146: in the place of the other. For, in a teleological judgement, the
10147: matter, even if the form that it assumes be judged possible only by
10148: design, can also, conformably to the mechanical laws of its nature,
10149: be subordinated as a means to the represented purpose. But, since the
10150: ground of this compatibility lies in that which is neither one nor
10151: the other (neither mechanism nor purposive combination), but is the
10152: supersensible substrate of nature of which we know nothing, the two
10153: ways of representing the possibility of such Objects are not to be
10154: blended together by our (human) Reason. However, we cannot judge of
10155: their possibility otherwise than by judging them as ultimately resting
10156: on a supreme Understanding by the connexion of final causes; and thus
10157: the teleological method of explanation is not eliminated.
10158: 
10159: Now it is quite indeterminate, and for our Understanding always
10160: indeterminable, how much the mechanism of nature does as a means
10161: towards each final design in nature. However, on account of the
10162: above-mentioned intelligible principle of the possibility of a nature
10163: in general, it may be assumed that it is possible throughout according
10164: to the two kinds of universally accordant laws (the physical and
10165: those of final causes), although we cannot see into the way how this
10166: takes place. Hence we do not know how far the mechanical method of
10167: explanation which is possible for us may extend. So much only is
10168: certain that, so far as we can go in this direction, it must always
10169: be inadequate for things that we once recognise as natural purposes;
10170: and therefore we must, by the constitution of our Understanding,
10171: subordinate these grounds collectively to a teleological principle.
10172: 
10173: Hereon is based a privilege, and on account of the importance which the
10174: study of nature by the principle of mechanism has for the theoretical
10175: use of our Reason, also an appeal. We should explain all products
10176: and occurrences in nature, even the most purposive, by mechanism as
10177: far as is in our power (the limits of which we cannot specify in
10178: this kind of investigation). But at the same time we are not to lose
10179: sight of the fact that those things which we cannot even state for
10180: investigation except under the concept of a purpose of Reason, must, in
10181: conformity with the essential constitution of our Reason, mechanical
10182: causes notwithstanding, be subordinated by us finally to causality in
10183: accordance with purposes.
10184: 
10185: 
10186: 
10187: 
10188: METHODOLOGY OF THE TELEOLOGICAL JUDGEMENT.[119]
10189: 
10190: 
10191: § 79. _Whether teleology must be treated as if it belonged to the
10192: doctrine of nature_
10193: 
10194: Every science must have its definite position in the encyclopaedia of
10195: all the sciences. If it is a philosophical science its position must be
10196: either in the theoretical or practical part. If again it has its place
10197: in the former of these, it must be either in the doctrine of nature, so
10198: far as it concerns that which can be an object of experience (in the
10199: doctrine of bodies, the doctrine of the soul, or the universal science
10200: of the world), or in the doctrine of God (the original ground of the
10201: world as the complex of all objects of experience).
10202: 
10203: Now the question is, what place is due to Teleology? Does it belong
10204: to Natural Science (properly so called) or to Theology? One of the
10205: two it must be; for no science belongs to the transition from one to
10206: the other, because this transition only marks the articulation or
10207: organisation of the system, and not a place in it.
10208: 
10209: That it does not belong to Theology as a part thereof, although it may
10210: be made of the most important use therein, is self-evident. For it has
10211: as its objects, natural productions, and their cause, and although it
10212: refers at the same time to the latter as to a ground lying outside of
10213: and beyond nature (a Divine Author), yet it does not do this for the
10214: determinant but only for the reflective Judgement in the consideration
10215: of nature (in order to guide our judgement on things in the world by
10216: means of such an Idea as a regulative principle, in conformity with the
10217: human Understanding).
10218: 
10219: But it appears to belong just as little to Natural Science, which needs
10220: determinant and not merely reflective principles in order to supply
10221: objective grounds for natural effects. In fact, nothing is gained for
10222: the theory of nature or the mechanical explanation of its phenomena
10223: by means of its effective causes, by considering them as connected
10224: according to the relation of purposes. The exhibition of the purposes
10225: of nature in its products, so far as they constitute a system according
10226: to teleological concepts, properly belongs only to a description of
10227: nature which is drawn up in accordance with a particular guiding
10228: thread. Here Reason, no doubt, accomplishes a noble work, instructive
10229: and practically purposive in many points of view; but it gives no
10230: information as to the origin and the inner possibility of these
10231: forms, which is the special business of theoretical Natural Science.
10232: Teleology, therefore, as science, belongs to no Doctrine, but only to
10233: Criticism; and to the criticism of a special cognitive faculty, viz.
10234: Judgement. But so far as it contains principles _a priori_, it can and
10235: must furnish the method by which nature must be judged according to the
10236: principle of final causes. Hence its Methodology has at least negative
10237: influence upon the procedure in theoretical Natural Science, and also
10238: upon the relation which this can have in Metaphysic to Theology as its
10239: propaedeutic.
10240: 
10241: 
10242: § 80. _Of the necessary subordination of the mechanical to the
10243: teleological principle in the explanation of a thing as a natural
10244: purpose_
10245: 
10246: The _privilege of aiming at_ a merely mechanical method of explanation
10247: of all natural products is in itself quite unlimited; but the _faculty
10248: of attaining_ thereto is by the constitution of our Understanding, so
10249: far as it has to do with things as natural purposes, not only very much
10250: limited but also clearly bounded. For, according to a principle of the
10251: Judgement, by this process alone nothing can be accomplished towards
10252: an explanation of these things; and consequently the judgement upon
10253: such products must always be at the same time subordinated by us to a
10254: teleological principle.
10255: 
10256: It is therefore rational, even meritorious, to pursue natural
10257: mechanism, in respect of the explanation of natural products, so far
10258: as can be done with probability; and if we give up the attempt it is
10259: not because it is impossible _in itself_ to meet in this path with the
10260: purposiveness of nature, but only because it is impossible _for us_
10261: as men. For there would be required for that an intuition other than
10262: sensuous, and a determinate knowledge of the intelligible substrate
10263: of nature from which a ground could be assigned for the mechanism of
10264: phenomena according to particular laws, which quite surpasses our
10265: faculties.
10266: 
10267: Hence if the naturalist would not waste his labour he must in judging
10268: of things, the concept of any of which is indubitably established
10269: as a natural purpose (organised beings), always lay down as basis an
10270: original organisation, which uses that very mechanism in order to
10271: produce fresh organised forms or to develop the existing ones into new
10272: shapes (which, however, always result from that purpose and conformably
10273: to it).
10274: 
10275: It is praiseworthy by the aid of comparative anatomy to go through the
10276: great creation of organised natures, in order to see whether there may
10277: not be in it something similar to a system and also in accordance with
10278: the principle of production. For otherwise we should have to be content
10279: with the mere principle of judgement (which gives no insight into
10280: their production) and, discouraged, to give up all claim to _natural
10281: insight_ in this field. The agreement of so many genera of animals
10282: in a certain common schema, which appears to be fundamental not only
10283: in the structure of their bones but also in the disposition of their
10284: remaining parts,--so that with an admirable simplicity of original
10285: outline, a great variety of species has been produced by the shortening
10286: of one member and the lengthening of another, the involution of this
10287: part and the evolution of that,--allows a ray of hope, however faint,
10288: to penetrate into our minds, that here something may be accomplished
10289: by the aid of the principle of the mechanism of nature (without
10290: which there can be no natural science in general). This analogy of
10291: forms, which with all their differences seem to have been produced
10292: according to a common original type, strengthens our suspicions of an
10293: actual relationship between them in their production from a common
10294: parent, through the gradual approximation of one animal-genus to
10295: another--from those in which the principle of purposes seems to be
10296: best authenticated, _i.e._ from man, down to the polype, and again from
10297: this down to mosses and lichens, and finally to the lowest stage of
10298: nature noticeable by us, viz. to crude matter. And so the whole Technic
10299: of nature, which is so incomprehensible to us in organised beings that
10300: we believe ourselves compelled to think a different principle for it,
10301: seems to be derived from matter and its powers according to mechanical
10302: laws (like those by which it works in the formation of crystals).
10303: 
10304: Here it is permissible for the _archaeologist_ of nature to derive
10305: from the surviving traces of its oldest revolutions, according to all
10306: its mechanism known or supposed by him, that great family of creatures
10307: (for so we must represent them if the said thoroughgoing relationship
10308: is to have any ground). He can suppose the bosom of mother earth, as
10309: she passed out of her chaotic state (like a great animal), to have
10310: given birth in the beginning to creatures of less purposive form, that
10311: these again gave birth to others which formed themselves with greater
10312: adaptation to their place of birth and their relations to each other;
10313: until this womb becoming torpid and ossified, limited its births to
10314: definite species not further modifiable, and the manifoldness remained
10315: as it was at the end of the operation of that fruitful formative
10316: power.--Only he must still in the end ascribe to this universal mother
10317: an organisation purposive in respect of all these creatures; otherwise
10318: it would not be possible to think the possibility of the purposive form
10319: of the products of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.[120] He has then
10320: only pushed further back the ground of explanation and cannot pretend
10321: to have made the development of those two kingdoms independent of the
10322: condition of final causes.
10323: 
10324: Even as concerns the variation to which certain individuals of
10325: organised genera are accidentally subjected, if we find that the
10326: character so changed is hereditary and is taken up into the generative
10327: power, then we cannot pertinently judge the variation to be anything
10328: else than an occasional development of purposive capacities originally
10329: present in the species with a view to the preservation of the race.
10330: For in the complete inner purposiveness of an organised being, the
10331: generation of its like is closely bound up with the condition of taking
10332: nothing up into the generative power which does not belong, in such
10333: a system of purposes, to one of its undeveloped original capacities.
10334: Indeed, if we depart from this principle, we cannot know with certainty
10335: whether several parts of the form which is now apparent in a species
10336: have not a contingent and unpurposive origin; and the principle of
10337: Teleology, to judge nothing in an organised being as unpurposive
10338: which maintains it in its propagation, would be very unreliable in its
10339: application and would be valid solely for the original stock (of which
10340: we have no further knowledge).
10341: 
10342: _Hume_[121] takes exception to those who find it requisite to
10343: assume for all such natural purposes a teleological principle of
10344: judgement, _i.e._ an architectonic Understanding. He says that it may
10345: fairly be asked: how is such an Understanding possible? How can the
10346: manifold faculties and properties that constitute the possibility
10347: of an Understanding, which has at the same time executive force,
10348: be found so purposively together in one Being? But this objection
10349: is without weight. For the whole difficulty which surrounds the
10350: question concerning the first production of a thing containing in
10351: itself purposes and only comprehensible by means of them, rests on
10352: the further question as to the unity of the ground of the combination
10353: in this product of the various elements [des Mannichfaltigen] which
10354: are _external to one another_. For if this ground be placed in the
10355: Understanding of a producing cause as simple substance, the question,
10356: so far as it is teleological, is sufficiently answered; but if the
10357: cause be sought merely in matter as an aggregate of many substances
10358: external to one another, the unity of the principle is quite
10359: wanting for the internally purposive form of its formation, and the
10360: _autocracy_ of matter in productions which can only be conceived by our
10361: Understanding as purposes is a word without meaning.
10362: 
10363: Hence it comes to pass that those who seek a supreme ground of
10364: possibility for the objectively-purposive forms of matter, without
10365: attributing to it Understanding, either make the world-whole into
10366: a single all-embracing substance (Pantheism), or (which is only a
10367: more determinate explanation of the former) into a complex of many
10368: determinations inhering in a single _simple substance_ (Spinozism);
10369: merely in order to satisfy that condition of all purposiveness--the
10370: _unity_ of ground. Thus they do justice indeed to _one_ condition of
10371: the problem, viz. the unity in the purposive combination, by means
10372: of the mere ontological concept of a simple substance; but they
10373: adduce nothing for the _other_ condition, viz. the relation of this
10374: substance to its result as _purpose_, through which relation that
10375: ontological ground is to be more closely determined in respect of
10376: the question at issue. Hence they answer _the whole_ question in no
10377: way. It remains absolutely unanswerable (for our Reason) if we do
10378: not represent that original ground of things, as simple _substance_;
10379: its property which has reference to the specific constitution of the
10380: forms of nature grounded thereon, viz. its purposive unity, as the
10381: property of an intelligent substance; and the relation of these forms
10382: to this intelligence (on account of the contingency which we ascribe
10383: to everything that we think possible only as a purpose) as that of
10384: _causality_.
10385: 
10386: 
10387: § 81. _Of the association of mechanism with the teleological principle
10388: in the explanation of a natural purpose as a natural product_
10389: 
10390: According to the preceding paragraphs the mechanism of nature alone
10391: does not enable us to think the possibility of an organised being;
10392: but (at least according to the constitution of our cognitive faculty)
10393: it must be originally subordinated to a cause working designedly.
10394: But, just as little is the mere teleological ground of such a being
10395: sufficient for considering it and judging it as a product of nature,
10396: if the mechanism of the latter be not associated with the former,
10397: like the instrument of a cause working designedly, to whose purposes
10398: nature is subordinated in its mechanical laws. The possibility of such
10399: a unification of two quite different kinds of causality,--of nature
10400: in its universal conformity to law with an Idea which limits it to a
10401: particular form, for which it contains no ground in itself--is not
10402: comprehended by our Reason. It lies in the supersensible substrate
10403: of nature, of which we can determine nothing positively, except that
10404: it is the being in itself of which we merely know the phenomenon.
10405: But the principle, “all that we assume as belonging to this nature
10406: (_phenomenon_) and as its product, must be thought as connected
10407: therewith according to mechanical laws,” has none the less force,
10408: because without this kind of causality organised beings (as purposes of
10409: nature) would not be natural products.
10410: 
10411: Now if the teleological principle of the production of these beings
10412: be assumed (as is inevitable), we can place at the basis of the
10413: cause of their internally purposive form either _Occasionalism_ or
10414: _Pre-established Harmony_. According to the former the Supreme Cause
10415: of the world would, conformably to its Idea, furnish immediately the
10416: organic formation on the occasion of every union of intermingling
10417: materials. According to the latter it would, in the original products
10418: of its wisdom, only have supplied the capacity by means of which
10419: an organic being produces another of like kind, and the species
10420: perpetually maintains itself; whilst the loss of individuals is
10421: continually replaced by that nature which at the same time works
10422: towards their destruction. If we assume the Occasionalism of the
10423: production of organised beings, all nature is quite lost, and with
10424: it all employment of Reason in judging of the possibility of such
10425: products; hence we may suppose that no one will adopt this system, who
10426: has anything to do with philosophy.
10427: 
10428: [The theory of] _Pre-established Harmony_ may proceed in two different
10429: ways. It regards every organised being as generated by one of like
10430: kind, either as an _educt_ or a _product_. The system which regards
10431: generations as mere educts is called the theory of _individual
10432: preformation_ or the theory of _evolution_: that which regards them
10433: as products is entitled the system of _epigenesis_. This latter may
10434: also be entitled the system of _generic preformation_, because the
10435: productive faculty of the generator and consequently the specific
10436: form would be _virtually_ performed according to the inner purposive
10437: capacities which are part of its stock. In correspondence with this the
10438: opposite theory of individual preformations would be better entitled
10439: the _theory of involution_.
10440: 
10441: The advocates of the _theory of evolution_, who remove every
10442: individual from the formative power of nature, in order to make
10443: it come immediately from the hand of the Creator, would, however,
10444: not venture to regard this as happening according to the hypothesis
10445: of Occasionalism. For according to this the copulation is a mere
10446: formality, _à propos_ of which a supreme intelligent Cause of the
10447: world has concluded to form a fruit immediately by his hand, and only
10448: to leave to the mother its development and nourishment. They declare
10449: themselves for preformation; as if it were not all the same, whether
10450: a supernatural origin is assigned to these forms in the beginning
10451: or in the course of the world. On the contrary, a great number of
10452: supernatural arrangements would be spared by occasional creation,
10453: which would be requisite, in order that the embryo formed in the
10454: beginning of the world might not be injured throughout the long period
10455: of its development by the destructive powers of nature, and might keep
10456: itself unharmed; and there would also be requisite an incalculably
10457: greater number of such preformed beings than would ever be developed,
10458: and with them many creations would be made without need and without
10459: purpose. They would, however, be willing to leave at least something
10460: to nature, so as not to fall into a complete Hyperphysic which can
10461: dispense with all natural explanations. It is true, they hold so
10462: fast by their Hyperphysic that they find even in abortions (which
10463: it is quite impossible to take for purposes of nature) an admirable
10464: purposiveness; though it be only directed to the fact that an anatomist
10465: would take exception to it as a purposeless purposiveness, and would
10466: feel a disheartened wonder thereat. But the production of hybrids
10467: could absolutely not be accommodated with the system of preformation;
10468: and to the seeds of the male creature, to which they had attributed
10469: nothing but the mechanical property of serving as the first means of
10470: nourishment for the embryo, they must attribute in addition a purposive
10471: formative power, which in the case of the product of two creatures of
10472: the same genus they would concede to neither parent.
10473: 
10474: On the other hand, even if we do not recognise the great superiority
10475: which the theory of _Epigenesis_ has over the former as regards the
10476: empirical grounds of its proof, still prior to proof Reason views this
10477: way of explanation with peculiar favour. For in respect of the things
10478: which we can only represent as possible originally according to the
10479: causality of purposes, at least as concerns their propagation, this
10480: theory regards nature as self-producing, not merely as self-evolving:
10481: and so with the least expenditure of the supernatural leaves to nature
10482: all that follows after the first beginning (though without determining
10483: anything about this first beginning by which Physic generally is
10484: thwarted, however it may essay its explanation by a chain of causes).
10485: 
10486: As regards this theory of Epigenesis, no one has contributed more
10487: either to its proof or to the establishment of the legitimate
10488: principles of its application,--partly by the limitation of a too
10489: presumptuous employment of it,--than Herr Hofr. _Blumenbach_.[122]
10490: In all physical explanations of these formations he starts from
10491: organised matter. That crude matter should have originally formed
10492: itself according to mechanical laws, that life should have sprung from
10493: the nature of what is lifeless, that matter should have been able to
10494: dispose itself into the form of a self-maintaining purposiveness--this
10495: he rightly declares to be contradictory to Reason. But at the same
10496: time he leaves to natural mechanism under this to us indispensable
10497: _principle_ of an original _organisation_, an undeterminable but yet
10498: unmistakeable element, in reference to which the faculty of matter in
10499: an organised body is called by him a _formative impulse_ (in contrast
10500: to, and yet standing under the higher guidance and direction of, that
10501: merely mechanical _formative power_ universally resident in matter).
10502: 
10503: 
10504: § 82. _Of the teleological system in the external relations of
10505: organised beings_
10506: 
10507: By external purposiveness I mean that by which one thing of nature
10508: serves another as means to a purpose. Now things which have no internal
10509: purposiveness and which presuppose none for their possibility, _e.g._
10510: earth, air, water, etc., may at the same time be very purposive
10511: externally, _i.e._ in relation to other beings. But these latter
10512: must be organised beings, _i.e._ natural purposes, for otherwise the
10513: former could not be judged as means to them. Thus water, air, and
10514: earth cannot be regarded as means to the raising of mountains, because
10515: mountains contain nothing in themselves that requires a ground of their
10516: possibility according to purposes, in reference to which therefore
10517: their cause can never be represented under the predicate of a means (as
10518: useful therefor).
10519: 
10520: External purposiveness is a quite different concept from that of
10521: internal purposiveness, which is bound up with the possibility of an
10522: object irrespective of its actuality being itself a purpose. We can ask
10523: about an organised being the question: What is it for? But we cannot
10524: easily ask this about things in which we recognise merely the working
10525: of nature’s mechanism. For in the former, as regards their internal
10526: possibility, we represent a causality according to purposes, a creative
10527: Understanding, and we refer this active faculty to its determining
10528: ground, viz. design. There is only one external purposiveness which
10529: is connected with the internal purposiveness of organisation, and yet
10530: serves in the external relation of a means to a purpose, without the
10531: question necessarily arising, as to what end this being so organised
10532: must have existed for. This is the organisation of both sexes in their
10533: mutual relation for the propagation of their kind; since here we can
10534: always ask, as in the case of an individual, why must such a pair
10535: exist? The answer is: This pair first constitutes an _organising_
10536: whole, though not an organised whole in a single body.
10537: 
10538: If we now ask, wherefore anything is, the answer is either: Its
10539: presence and its production have no reference at all to a cause working
10540: according to design, and so we always refer its origin to the mechanism
10541: of nature, or: There is somewhere a designed ground of its presence
10542: (as a contingent natural being). This thought we can hardly separate
10543: from the concept of an organised thing; for, since we must place at
10544: the basis of its internal possibility a causality of final causes and
10545: an Idea lying at the ground of this, we cannot think the existence
10546: of this product except as a purpose. For the represented effect, the
10547: representation of which is at the same time the determining ground
10548: of the intelligent cause working towards its production, is called a
10549: _purpose_. In this case therefore we can either say: The purpose of
10550: the existence of such a natural being is in itself; _i.e._ it is not
10551: merely a purpose but a _final purpose_, or: This is external to it in
10552: another natural being, _i.e._ it exists purposively not as a final
10553: purpose, but necessarily as a means.
10554: 
10555: But if we go through the whole of nature we find in it, as nature,
10556: no being which could make claim to the eminence of being the final
10557: purpose of creation; and we can even prove _a priori_ that what might
10558: be for nature an _ultimate purpose_, according to all the thinkable
10559: determinations and properties wherewith one could endow it, could yet
10560: as a natural thing never be a _final purpose_.
10561: 
10562: If we consider the vegetable kingdom we might at first sight, on
10563: account of the immeasurable fertility with which it spreads itself
10564: almost on every soil, be led to take it for a mere product of that
10565: mechanism which nature displays in the formations of the mineral
10566: kingdom. But a more intimate knowledge of its indescribably wise
10567: organisation does not permit us to hold to this thought, but prompts
10568: the question: What are these things created for? If it is answered:
10569: For the animal kingdom, which is thereby nourished and has thus been
10570: able to spread over the earth in genera so various, then the further
10571: question comes: What are these plant-devouring animals for? The answer
10572: would be something like this: For beasts of prey, which can only be
10573: nourished by that which has life. Finally we have the question: What
10574: are these last, as well as the first-mentioned natural kingdoms, good
10575: for? For man, in reference to the manifold use which his Understanding
10576: teaches him to make of all these creatures. He is the ultimate purpose
10577: of creation here on earth, because he is the only being upon it who
10578: can form a concept of purposes, and who can by his Reason make out of
10579: an aggregate of purposively formed things a system of purposes.
10580: 
10581: We might also with the chevalier _Linnaeus_[123] go the apparently
10582: opposite way and say: The herbivorous animals are there to moderate
10583: the luxurious growth of the vegetable kingdom, by which many of its
10584: species are choked. The carnivora are to set bounds to the voracity of
10585: the herbivora. Finally man, by his pursuit of these and his diminution
10586: of their numbers, preserves a certain equilibrium between the producing
10587: and the destructive powers of nature. And so man, although in a certain
10588: reference he might be esteemed a purpose, yet in another has only the
10589: rank of a means.
10590: 
10591: If an objective purposiveness in the variety of the genera of creatures
10592: and their external relations to one another, as purposively constructed
10593: beings, be made a principle, then it is conformable to Reason to
10594: conceive in these relations a certain organisation and a system of all
10595: natural kingdoms according to final causes. Only here experience seems
10596: flatly to contradict the maxims of Reason, especially as concerns an
10597: ultimate purpose of nature, which is indispensable for the possibility
10598: of such a system and which we can put nowhere else but in man. For
10599: regarding him as one of the many animal genera, nature has not in the
10600: least excepted him from its destructive or its productive powers, but
10601: has subjected everything to a mechanism thereof without any purpose.
10602: 
10603: The first thing that must be designedly prepared in an arrangement
10604: for a purposive complex of natural beings on the earth would be their
10605: place of habitation, the soil and the element on and in which they
10606: are to thrive. But a more exact knowledge of the constitution of
10607: this basis of all organic production indicates no other causes than
10608: those working quite undesignedly, causes which rather destroy than
10609: favour production, order, and purposes. Land and sea not only contain
10610: in themselves memorials of ancient mighty desolations which have
10611: confounded them and all creatures that are in them; but their whole
10612: structure, the strata of the one and the boundaries of the other, have
10613: quite the appearance of being the product of the wild and violent
10614: forces of a nature working in a state of chaos. Although the figure,
10615: the structure, and the slope of the land might seem to be purposively
10616: ordered for the reception of water from the air, for the welling
10617: up of streams between strata of different kinds (for many kinds of
10618: products), and for the course of rivers--yet a closer investigation
10619: shows that they are merely the effects of volcanic eruptions or of
10620: inundations of the ocean, as regards not only the first production of
10621: this figure, but, above all, its subsequent transformation, as well as
10622: the disappearance of its first organic productions.[124] Now if the
10623: place of habitation of all these creatures, the soil (of the land)
10624: or the bosom (of the sea), indicates nothing but a quite undesigned
10625: mechanism of its production, how and with what right can we demand and
10626: maintain a different origin for these latter products? The closest
10627: examination, indeed (in _Camper’s_[125] judgement), of the remains
10628: of the aforesaid devastations of nature seems to show that man was
10629: not comprehended in these revolutions; but yet he is so dependent on
10630: the remaining creatures that, if a universally directing mechanism of
10631: nature be admitted in the case of the others, he must also be regarded
10632: as comprehended under it; even though his Understanding (for the most
10633: part at least) has been able to deliver him from these devastations.
10634: 
10635: But this argument seems to prove more than was intended by it. It seems
10636: to prove not merely that man cannot be the ultimate purpose of nature,
10637: and that on the same grounds the aggregate of the organised things of
10638: nature on the earth cannot be a system of purposes; but also that the
10639: natural products formerly held to be natural purposes have no other
10640: origin than the mechanism of nature.
10641: 
10642: But in the solution given above of the Antinomy of the principles
10643: of the mechanical and teleological methods of production of organic
10644: beings of nature, we have seen that they are merely principles of
10645: the reflective Judgement in respect of nature as it produces forms
10646: in accordance with particular laws (for the systematic connexion of
10647: which we have no key). They do not determine the origin of these
10648: beings in themselves; but only say that we, by the constitution of
10649: our Understanding and our Reason, cannot conceive it in this kind of
10650: being except according to final causes. The greatest possible effort,
10651: even audacity, in the attempt to explain them mechanically is not only
10652: permitted, but we are invited to it by Reason; notwithstanding that
10653: we know from the subjective grounds of the particular species and
10654: limitations of our Understanding (not _e.g._ because the mechanism
10655: of production would contradict in itself an origin according to
10656: purposes) that we can never attain thereto. Finally, the compatibility
10657: of both ways of representing the possibility of nature may lie in
10658: the supersensible principle of nature (external to us, as well as in
10659: us); whilst the method of representation according to final causes
10660: may be only a subjective condition of the use of our Reason, when it
10661: not merely wishes to form a judgement upon objects as phenomena, but
10662: desires to refer these phenomena together with their principles to
10663: their supersensible substrate, in order to find certain laws of their
10664: unity possible, which it cannot represent to itself except through
10665: purposes (of which the Reason also has such as are supersensible).
10666: 
10667: 
10668: § 83. _Of the ultimate purpose of nature as a teleological system_
10669: 
10670: We have shown in the preceding that, though not for the determinant but
10671: for the reflective Judgement, we have sufficient cause for judging man
10672: to be, not merely like all organised beings a _natural purpose_, but
10673: also the _ultimate purpose_ of nature here on earth; in reference to
10674: whom all other natural things constitute a system of purposes according
10675: to fundamental propositions of Reason. If now that must be found in
10676: man himself, which is to be furthered as a purpose by means of his
10677: connexion with nature, this purpose must either be of a kind that
10678: can be satisfied by nature in its beneficence; or it is the aptitude
10679: and skill for all kinds of purposes for which nature (external and
10680: internal) can be used by him. The first purpose of nature would be
10681: man’s _happiness_, the second his _culture_.
10682: 
10683: The concept of happiness is not one that man derives by abstraction
10684: from his instincts and so deduces from his animal nature; but it is a
10685: mere _Idea_ of a state, that he wishes to make adequate to the Idea
10686: under merely empirical conditions (which is impossible). This Idea he
10687: projects in such different ways on account of the complication of his
10688: Understanding with Imagination and Sense, and changes so often, that
10689: nature, even if it were entirely subjected to his elective will, could
10690: receive absolutely no determinate, universal and fixed law, so as to
10691: harmonise with this vacillating concept and thus with the purpose which
10692: each man arbitrarily sets before himself. And even if we reduce this
10693: to the true natural wants as to which our race is thoroughly agreed,
10694: or on the other hand, raise ever so high man’s skill to accomplish his
10695: imagined purposes; yet, even thus, what man understands by happiness,
10696: and what is in fact his proper, ultimate, natural purpose (not purpose
10697: of freedom), would never be attained by him. For it is not his nature
10698: to rest and be contented with the possession and enjoyment of anything
10699: whatever. On the other side, too, there is something wanting. Nature
10700: has not taken him for her special darling and favoured him with benefit
10701: above all animals. Rather, in her destructive operations,--plague,
10702: hunger, perils of waters, frost, assaults of other animals great and
10703: small, etc.,--in these things has she spared him as little as any other
10704: animal. Further, the inconsistency of his own _natural dispositions_
10705: drives him into self-devised torments, and also reduces others of his
10706: own race to misery, by the oppression of lordship, the barbarism of
10707: war, and so forth; he, himself, as far as in him lies, works for the
10708: destruction of his own race; so that even with the most beneficent
10709: external nature, its purpose, if it were directed to the happiness
10710: of our species, would not be attained in an earthly system, because
10711: our nature is not susceptible of it. Man is then always only a link
10712: in the chain of natural purposes; a principle certainly in respect
10713: of many purposes, for which nature seems to have destined him in her
10714: disposition, and towards which he sets himself, but also a means for
10715: the maintenance of purposiveness in the mechanism of the remaining
10716: links. As the only being on earth which has an Understanding and,
10717: consequently, a faculty of setting arbitrary purposes before itself, he
10718: is certainly entitled to be the lord of nature; and if it be regarded
10719: as a teleological system he is, by his destination, the ultimate
10720: purpose of nature. But this is subject to the condition of his having
10721: an Understanding and the Will to give to it and to himself such a
10722: reference to purposes, as can be self-sufficient independently of
10723: nature, and, consequently, can be a final purpose; which, however, must
10724: not be sought in nature itself.
10725: 
10726: But in order to find out where in man we have to place that _ultimate
10727: purpose_ of nature, we must seek out what nature can supply to prepare
10728: him for what he must do himself in order to be a final purpose, and
10729: we must separate it from all those purposes whose possibility depends
10730: upon things that one can expect only from nature. Of the latter
10731: kind is earthly happiness, by which is understood the complex of all
10732: man’s purposes possible through nature, whether external nature or
10733: man’s nature; _i.e._ the matter of all his earthly purposes, which,
10734: if he makes it his whole purpose, renders him incapable of positing
10735: his own existence as a final purpose, and being in harmony therewith.
10736: There remains therefore of all his purposes in nature only the formal
10737: subjective condition; viz. the aptitude of setting purposes in
10738: general before himself, and (independent of nature in his purposive
10739: determination) of using nature, conformably to the maxims of his free
10740: purposes in general, as a means. This nature can do in regard to the
10741: final purpose that lies outside it, and it therefore may be regarded
10742: as its ultimate purpose. The production of the aptitude of a rational
10743: being for arbitrary purposes in general (consequently in his freedom)
10744: is _culture_. Therefore, culture alone can be the ultimate purpose
10745: which we have cause for ascribing to nature in respect to the human
10746: race (not man’s earthly happiness or the fact that he is the chief
10747: instrument of instituting order and harmony in irrational nature
10748: external to himself).
10749: 
10750: But all culture is not adequate to this ultimate purpose of nature. The
10751: culture of _skill_ is indeed the chief subjective condition of aptitude
10752: for furthering one’s purposes in general; but it is not adequate to
10753: furthering the _will_[126] in the determination and choice of purposes,
10754: which yet essentially belongs to the whole extent of an aptitude for
10755: purposes. The latter condition of aptitude, which we might call the
10756: culture of training (discipline), is negative, and consists in the
10757: freeing of the will from the despotism of desires. By these, tied as
10758: we are to certain natural things, we are rendered incapable even of
10759: choosing, while we allow those impulses to serve as fetters, which
10760: Nature has given us as guiding threads that we should not neglect or
10761: violate the destination of our animal nature--we being all the time
10762: free enough to strain or relax, to extend or diminish them, according
10763: as the purposes of Reason require.
10764: 
10765: Skill cannot be developed in the human race except by means of
10766: inequality among men; for the great majority provide the necessities
10767: of life, as it were, mechanically, without requiring any art in
10768: particular, for the convenience and leisure of others who work at the
10769: less necessary elements of culture, science and art. In an oppressed
10770: condition they have hard work and little enjoyment, although much of
10771: the culture of the higher classes gradually spreads to them. Yet with
10772: the progress of this culture (the height of which is called luxury,
10773: reached when the propensity to what can be done without begins to be
10774: injurious to what is indispensable), their calamities increase equally
10775: in two directions, on the one hand through violence from without, on
10776: the other hand through internal discontent; but still this splendid
10777: misery is bound up with the development of the natural capacities of
10778: the human race, and the purpose of nature itself, although not our
10779: purpose, is thus attained. The formal condition under which nature
10780: can alone attain this its final design, is that arrangement of men’s
10781: relations to one another, by which lawful authority in a whole,
10782: which we call a _civil community_, is opposed to the abuse of their
10783: conflicting freedoms; only in this can the greatest development
10784: of natural capacities take place. For this also there would be
10785: requisite,--if men were clever enough to find it out and wise enough
10786: to submit themselves voluntarily to its constraint,--a _cosmopolitan_
10787: whole, _i.e._ a system of all states that are in danger of acting
10788: injuriously upon each other.[127] Failing this, and with the obstacles
10789: which ambition, lust of dominion, and avarice, especially in those
10790: who have the authority in their hands, oppose even to the possibility
10791: of such a scheme, there is, inevitably, _war_ (by which sometimes
10792: states subdivide and resolve themselves into smaller states, sometimes
10793: a state annexes other smaller states and strives to form a greater
10794: whole). Though war is an undesigned enterprise of men (stirred up by
10795: their unbridled passions), yet is it [perhaps][128] a deep-hidden
10796: and designed enterprise of supreme wisdom for preparing, if not for
10797: establishing, conformity to law amid the freedom of states, and with
10798: this a unity of a morally grounded system of those states. In spite of
10799: the dreadful afflictions with which it visits the human race, and the
10800: perhaps greater afflictions with which the constant preparation for it
10801: in time of peace oppresses them, yet is it (although the hope for a
10802: restful state of popular happiness is ever further off) a motive for
10803: developing all talents serviceable for culture, to the highest possible
10804: pitch.[129]
10805: 
10806: As concerns the discipline of the inclinations,--for which our
10807: natural capacity in regard of our destination as an animal race is
10808: quite purposive, but which render the development of humanity very
10809: difficult,--there is manifest in respect of this second requirement for
10810: culture a purposive striving of nature to a cultivation which makes us
10811: receptive of higher purposes than nature itself can supply. We cannot
10812: strive against the preponderance of evil, which is poured out upon us
10813: by the refinement of taste pushed to idealisation, and even by the
10814: luxury of science as affording food for pride, through the insatiable
10815: number of inclinations thus aroused. But yet we cannot mistake the
10816: purpose of nature--ever aiming to win us away from the rudeness and
10817: violence of those inclinations (inclinations to enjoyment) which belong
10818: rather to our animality, and for the most part are opposed to the
10819: cultivation of our higher destiny, and to make way for the development
10820: of our humanity. The beautiful arts and the sciences which, by their
10821: universally-communicable pleasure, and by the polish and refinement
10822: of society, make man more civilised, if not morally better, win us in
10823: large measure from the tyranny of sense-propensions, and thus prepare
10824: men for a lordship, in which Reason alone shall have authority;
10825: whilst the evils with which we are visited, partly by nature, partly
10826: by the intolerant selfishness of men, summon, strengthen, and harden
10827: the powers of the soul not to submit to them, and so make us feel an
10828: aptitude for higher purposes, which lies hidden in us.[130]
10829: 
10830: 
10831: § 84. _Of the final purpose of the existence of a world, i.e. of
10832: creation itself_
10833: 
10834: A _final purpose_ is that purpose which needs no other as condition of
10835: its possibility.
10836: 
10837: If the mere mechanism of nature be assumed as the ground of explanation
10838: of its purposiveness, we cannot ask: what are things in the world
10839: there for? For according to such an idealistic system it is only the
10840: physical possibility of things (to think which as purposes would be
10841: mere subtlety without any Object) that is under discussion; whether we
10842: refer this form of things to chance or to blind necessity, in either
10843: case the question would be vain. If, however, we assume the purposive
10844: combination in the world to be real and to be [brought about] by a
10845: particular kind of causality, viz. that of a _designedly-working_
10846: cause, we cannot stop at the question: why have things of the world
10847: (organised beings) this or that form? why are they placed by nature
10848: in this or that relation to one another? But once an Understanding
10849: is thought that must be regarded as the cause of the possibility of
10850: such forms as are actually found in things, it must be also asked
10851: on objective grounds: Who could have determined this productive
10852: Understanding to an operation of this kind? This being is then the
10853: final purpose in reference to which such things are there.
10854: 
10855: I have said above that the final purpose is not a purpose which nature
10856: would be competent to bring about and to produce in conformity with
10857: its Idea, because it is unconditioned. For there is nothing in nature
10858: (regarded as a sensible being) for which the determining ground present
10859: in itself would not be always conditioned; and this holds not merely of
10860: external (material) nature, but also of internal (thinking) nature--it
10861: being of course understood that I only am considering that in myself
10862: which is nature. But a thing that is to exist necessarily, on account
10863: of its objective constitution, as the final purpose of an intelligent
10864: cause, must be of the kind that in the order of purposes it is
10865: dependent on no further condition than merely its Idea.
10866: 
10867: Now we have in the world only one kind of beings whose causality
10868: is teleological, _i.e._ is directed to purposes and is at the same
10869: time so constituted that the law according to which they have to
10870: determine purposes for themselves is represented as unconditioned and
10871: independent of natural conditions, and yet as in itself necessary. The
10872: being of this kind is man, but man considered as noumenon; the only
10873: natural being in which we can recognise, on the side of its peculiar
10874: constitution, a supersensible faculty (_freedom_) and also the law of
10875: causality, together with its Object, which this faculty may propose to
10876: itself as highest purpose (the highest good in the world).
10877: 
10878: Now of man (and so of every rational creature in the World) as a moral
10879: being it can no longer be asked: why (_quem in finem_) he exists? His
10880: existence involves the highest purpose to which, as far as is in his
10881: power, he can subject the whole of nature; contrary to which at least
10882: he cannot regard himself as subject to any influence of nature.--If now
10883: things of the world, as beings dependent in their existence, need a
10884: supreme cause acting according to purposes, man is the final purpose of
10885: creation; since without him the chain of mutually subordinated purposes
10886: would not be complete as regards its ground. Only in man, and only in
10887: him as subject of morality, do we meet with unconditioned legislation
10888: in respect of purposes, which therefore alone renders him capable of
10889: being a final purpose, to which the whole of nature is teleologically
10890: subordinated.[131]
10891: 
10892: 
10893: § 85. _Of Physico-theology_
10894: 
10895: _Physico-theology_ is the endeavour of Reason to infer the Supreme
10896: Cause of nature and its properties from the _purposes_ of nature (which
10897: can only be empirically known). _Moral theology_ (ethico-theology)
10898: would be the endeavour to infer that Cause and its properties from
10899: the moral purpose of rational beings in nature (which can be known _a
10900: priori_).
10901: 
10902: The former naturally precedes the latter. For if we wish to infer a
10903: World Cause _teleologically_ from the things in the world, purposes
10904: of nature must first be given, for which we afterwards have to seek
10905: a final purpose, and for this the principle of the causality of this
10906: Supreme Cause.
10907: 
10908: Many investigations of nature can and must be conducted according to
10909: the teleological principle, without our having cause to inquire into
10910: the ground of the possibility of purposive working with which we meet
10911: in various products of nature. But if we wish to have a concept of this
10912: we have absolutely no further insight into it than the maxim of the
10913: reflective Judgement affords: viz. if only a single organic product of
10914: nature were given to us, by the constitution of our cognitive faculty
10915: we could think no other ground for it than that of a cause of nature
10916: itself (whether the whole of nature or only this bit of it) which
10917: contains the causality for it through Understanding. This principle of
10918: judging, though it does not bring us any further in the explanation of
10919: natural things and their origin, yet discloses to us an outlook over
10920: nature, by which perhaps we may be able to determine more closely the
10921: concept, otherwise so unfruitful, of an Original Being.
10922: 
10923: Now I say that Physico-theology, however far it may be pursued, can
10924: disclose to us nothing of a _final purpose_ of creation; for it does
10925: not even extend to the question as to this. It can, it is true, justify
10926: the concept of an intelligent World Cause, as a subjective concept
10927: (only available for the constitution of our cognitive faculty) of
10928: the possibility of things that we can make intelligible to ourselves
10929: according to purposes; but it cannot determine this concept further,
10930: either in a theoretical or a practical point of view. Its endeavour
10931: does not come up to its design of being the basis of a Theology, but
10932: it always remains only a physical Teleology; because the purposive
10933: reference therein is and must be always considered only as conditioned
10934: in nature, and it consequently cannot inquire into the purpose for
10935: which nature itself exists (for which the ground must be sought outside
10936: nature),--notwithstanding that it is upon the determinate Idea of this
10937: that the determinate concept of that Supreme Intelligent World Cause,
10938: and the consequent possibility of a Theology, depend.
10939: 
10940: What the things in the world are mutually useful for; what good the
10941: manifold in a thing does for the thing; how we have ground to assume
10942: that nothing in the world is in vain, but that everything _in nature_
10943: is good for something,--the condition being granted that certain things
10944: are to exist (as purposes), whence our Reason has in its power for
10945: the Judgement no other principle of the possibility of the Object,
10946: which it inevitably judges teleologically, than that of subordinating
10947: the mechanism of nature to the Architectonic of an intelligent Author
10948: of the world--all this the teleological consideration of the world
10949: supplies us with excellently and to our extreme admiration. But
10950: because the data, and so the principles, for _determining_ that concept
10951: of an intelligent World Cause (as highest artist) are merely empirical,
10952: they do not enable us to infer any of its properties beyond those which
10953: experience reveals in its effects. Now experience, since it can never
10954: embrace collective nature as a system, must often (apparently) happen
10955: upon this concept (and by mutually conflicting grounds of proof); but
10956: it can never, even if we had the power of surveying empirically the
10957: whole system as far as it concerns mere nature, raise us above nature
10958: to the purpose of its existence, and so to the determinate concept of
10959: that supreme Intelligence.
10960: 
10961: If we lessen the problem with the solution of which Physico-theology
10962: has to do, its solution appears easy. If we reduce the concept of a
10963: _Deity_ to that of an intelligent being thought by us, of which there
10964: may be one or more, which possesses many and very great properties,
10965: but not all the properties which are requisite for the foundation of a
10966: nature in harmony with the greatest possible purpose; or if we do not
10967: scruple in a theory to supply by arbitrary additions what is deficient
10968: in the grounds of proof, and so, where we have only ground for assuming
10969: _much_ perfection (and what is “much” for us?), consider ourselves
10970: entitled to presuppose _all possible_ perfection; thus indeed physical
10971: Teleology may make weighty claims to the distinction of being the basis
10972: of a Theology. But if we are desired to point out what impels and
10973: moreover authorises us to add these supplements, then we shall seek in
10974: vain for a ground of justification in the principles of the theoretical
10975: use of Reason, which is ever desirous in the explanation of an Object
10976: of experience to ascribe to it no more properties than those for which
10977: empirical data of possibility are to be found. On closer examination
10978: we should see that properly speaking an Idea of a Supreme Being, which
10979: rests on a quite different use of Reason (the practical use), lies in
10980: us fundamentally _a priori_, impelling us to supplement, by the concept
10981: of a Deity, the defective representation, supplied by a physical
10982: Teleology, of the original ground of the purposes in nature; and we
10983: should not falsely imagine that we had worked out this Idea, and with
10984: it a Theology by means of the theoretical use of Reason in the physical
10985: cognition of the world--much less that we had proved its reality.
10986: 
10987: One cannot blame the ancients much, if they thought of their gods as
10988: differing much from each other both as regards their faculties and as
10989: regards their designs and volitions, but yet thought of all of them,
10990: the Supreme One not excepted, as always limited after human fashion.
10991: For if they considered the arrangement and the course of things in
10992: nature, they certainly found ground enough for assuming something
10993: more than mechanism as its cause, and for conjecturing behind the
10994: machinery of this world designs of certain higher causes, which they
10995: could not think otherwise than superhuman. But because they met with
10996: good and evil, the purposive and the unpurposive, mingled together (at
10997: least as far as our insight goes), and could not permit themselves
10998: to assume nevertheless that wise and benevolent purposes of which
10999: they saw no proof lay hidden at bottom, on behalf of the arbitrary
11000: Idea of a supremely perfect original Author, their judgement upon
11001: the supreme World Cause could hardly have been other than it was, so
11002: long as they proceeded consistently according to maxims of the mere
11003: theoretical use of Reason. Others, who wished to be theologians as
11004: well as physicists, thought to find contentment for the Reason by
11005: providing for the absolute unity of the principle of natural things
11006: which Reason demands, the Idea of a Being of which as sole Substance
11007: the things would be all only inherent determinations. This Substance
11008: would not be Cause of the World by means of intelligence, but in it all
11009: the intelligences of the beings in the world would be comprised. This
11010: Being consequently would produce nothing according to purposes; but in
11011: it all things, on account of the unity of the subject of which they are
11012: mere determinations, must necessarily relate themselves purposively to
11013: one another, though without purpose and design. Thus they introduced
11014: the Idealism of final causes, by changing the unity (so difficult to
11015: explain) of a number of purposively combined substances, from being
11016: the unity of causal dependence _on one_ Substance to be the unity of
11017: inherence _in one_. This system--which in the sequel, considered on the
11018: side of the inherent world beings, becomes _Pantheism_, and (later) on
11019: the side of the Subject subsisting by itself as Original Being, becomes
11020: _Spinozism_,--does not so much resolve as explain away into nothing the
11021: question of the first ground of the purposiveness of nature; because
11022: this latter concept, bereft of all reality, must be taken for a mere
11023: misinterpretation of a universal ontological concept of a thing in
11024: general.
11025: 
11026: Hence the concept of a Deity, which would be adequate for our
11027: teleological judging of nature, can never be derived from mere
11028: theoretical principles of the use of Reason (on which Physico-theology
11029: alone is based). For as one alternative we may explain all Teleology
11030: as a mere deception of the Judgement in its judging of the causal
11031: combination of things, and fly to the sole principle of a mere
11032: mechanism of nature, which merely seems to us, on account of the unity
11033: of the Substance of whose determinations nature is but the manifold,
11034: to contain a universal reference to purposes. Or if, instead of this
11035: Idealism of final causes, we wish to remain attached to the principle
11036: of the Realism of this particular kind of causality, we may set
11037: beneath natural purposes many intelligent original beings or only a
11038: single one. But so far as we have for the basis of this concept [of
11039: Realism] only empirical principles derived from the actual purposive
11040: combination in the world, we cannot on the one hand find any remedy for
11041: the discordance that nature presents in many examples in respect of
11042: unity of purpose; and on the other hand, as to the concept of a single
11043: intelligent Cause, so far as we are authorised by mere experience, we
11044: can never draw it therefrom in a manner sufficiently determined for any
11045: serviceable Theology whatever (whether theoretical or practical).
11046: 
11047: Physical Teleology impels us, it is true, to seek a Theology; but it
11048: cannot produce one, however far we may investigate nature by means of
11049: experience and, in reference to the purposive combination apparent in
11050: it, call in Ideas of Reason (which must be theoretical for physical
11051: problems). What is the use, one might well complain, of placing at the
11052: basis of all these arrangements a great Understanding incommensurable
11053: by us, and supposing it to govern the world according to design, if
11054: nature does not and cannot tell us anything of the final design? For
11055: without this we cannot refer all these natural purposes to any common
11056: point, nor can we form any teleological principle, sufficient either
11057: for cognising the purposes collected in a system, or for forming a
11058: concept of the Supreme Understanding, as Cause of such a nature, that
11059: could serve as a standard for our Judgement reflecting teleologically
11060: thereon. I should thus have an _artistic Understanding_ for scattered
11061: purposes, but no _Wisdom_ for a final purpose, in which final purpose
11062: nevertheless must be contained the determining ground of the said
11063: Understanding. But in the absence of a final purpose which pure Reason
11064: alone can supply (because all purposes in the world are empirically
11065: conditioned, and can contain nothing absolutely good but only what is
11066: good for this or that regarded as a contingent design), and which alone
11067: would teach me what properties, what degree, and what relation of the
11068: Supreme Cause to nature I have to think in order to judge of nature as
11069: a teleological system; how and with what right do I dare to extend at
11070: pleasure my very limited concept of that original Understanding (which
11071: I can base on my limited knowledge of the world), of the Might of that
11072: original Being in actualising its Ideas, and of its Will to do so, and
11073: complete this into the Idea of an Allwise, Infinite Being? If this is
11074: to be done theoretically, it would presuppose omniscience in me, in
11075: order to see into the purposes of nature in their whole connexion, and
11076: in addition the power of conceiving all possible plans, in comparison
11077: with which the present plan would be judged on [sufficient] grounds
11078: as the best. For without this complete knowledge of the effect I can
11079: arrive at no determinate concept of the Supreme Cause, which can only
11080: be found in the concept of an Intelligence infinite in every respect,
11081: _i.e._ the concept of a Deity, and so I can supply no foundation for
11082: Theology.
11083: 
11084: Hence, with every possible extension of physical Teleology, according
11085: to the propositions above laid down we may say: By the constitution
11086: and the principles of our cognitive faculty we can think of nature, in
11087: its purposive arrangements which have become known to us, in no other
11088: way than as the product of an Understanding to which it is subject.
11089: But the theoretical investigation of nature can never reveal to us
11090: whether this Understanding may not also, with the whole of nature and
11091: its production, have had a final design (which would not lie in the
11092: nature of the sensible world). On the contrary, with all our knowledge
11093: of nature it remains undecided whether that Supreme Cause is its
11094: original ground according to a final purpose, or not rather by means
11095: of an Understanding determined by the mere necessity of its nature to
11096: produce certain forms (according to the analogy of what we call the
11097: art-instinct in animals); without it being necessary to ascribe to
11098: it even wisdom, much less the highest wisdom combined with all other
11099: properties requisite for the perfection of its product.
11100: 
11101: Hence Physico-theology is a misunderstood physical Teleology, only
11102: serviceable as a preparation (propaedeutic) for Theology; and it is
11103: only adequate to this design by the aid of a foreign principle on which
11104: it can rely, and not in itself, as its name would intimate.
11105: 
11106: 
11107: § 86. _Of Ethico-theology_
11108: 
11109: The commonest Understanding, if it thinks over the presence of things
11110: in the world, and the existence of the world itself, cannot forbear
11111: from the judgement that all the various creatures, no matter how great
11112: the art displayed in their arrangement, and how various their purposive
11113: mutual connexion,--even the complex of their numerous systems (which
11114: we incorrectly call worlds),--would be for nothing, if there were not
11115: also men (rational beings in general). Without men the whole creation
11116: would be a mere waste, in vain, and without final purpose. But it is
11117: not in reference to man’s cognitive faculty (theoretical Reason) that
11118: the being of everything else in the world gets its worth; he is not
11119: there merely that there may be some one to _contemplate_ the world.
11120: For if the contemplation of the world only afforded a representation
11121: of things without any final purpose, no worth could accrue to its
11122: being from the mere fact that it is known; we must presuppose for it
11123: a final purpose, in reference to which its contemplation itself has
11124: worth. Again it is not in reference to the feeling of pleasure, or to
11125: the sum of pleasures, that we think a final purpose of creation as
11126: given; _i.e._ we do not estimate that absolute worth by well-being or
11127: by enjoyment (whether bodily or mental), or in a word, by happiness.
11128: For the fact that man, if he exists, takes this for his final design,
11129: gives us no concept as to why in general he should exist, and as to
11130: what worth he has in himself to make his existence pleasant. He must,
11131: therefore, be supposed to be the final purpose of creation, in order
11132: to have a rational ground for holding that nature must harmonise with
11133: his happiness, if it is considered as an absolute whole according
11134: to principles of purposes.--Hence there remains only the faculty of
11135: desire; not, however, that which makes man dependent (through sensuous
11136: impulses) upon nature, nor that in respect of which the worth of his
11137: being depends upon what he receives and enjoys. But the worth which
11138: he alone can give to himself, and which consists in what he does, how
11139: and according to what principles he acts, and that not as a link in
11140: nature’s chain but in the _freedom_ of his faculty of desire--_i.e._ a
11141: good will--is that whereby alone his being can have an absolute worth,
11142: and in reference to which the being of the world can have a _final
11143: purpose_.
11144: 
11145: The commonest judgement of healthy human Reason completely accords
11146: with this, that it is only as a moral being that man can be a final
11147: purpose of creation; if we but direct men’s attention to the question
11148: and incite them to investigate it. What does it avail, one will say,
11149: that this man has so much talent, that he is so active therewith, and
11150: that he exerts thereby a useful influence over the community, thus
11151: having a great worth both in relation to his own happy condition and
11152: to the benefit of others, if he does not possess a good will? He is a
11153: contemptible Object considered in respect of his inner self; and if the
11154: creation is not to be without any final purpose at all, he, who as man
11155: belongs to it, must, in a world under moral laws, inasmuch as he is a
11156: bad man, forfeit his subjective purpose (happiness). This is the only
11157: condition under which his existence can accord with the final purpose.
11158: 
11159: If now we meet with purposive arrangements in the world and, as Reason
11160: inevitably requires, subordinate the purposes that are only conditioned
11161: to an unconditioned, supreme, _i.e._ final, purpose; then we easily see
11162: in the first place that we are thus concerned not with a purpose of
11163: nature (internal to itself), so far as it exists, but with the purpose
11164: of its existence along with all its ordinances, and, consequently, with
11165: the ultimate _purpose of creation_, and specially with the supreme
11166: condition under which can be posited a final purpose (_i.e._ the ground
11167: which determines a supreme Understanding to produce the beings of the
11168: world).
11169: 
11170: Since now it is only as a moral being that we recognise man as the
11171: purpose of creation, we have in the first place a ground (at least, the
11172: chief condition) for regarding the world as a whole connected according
11173: to purposes, and as a _system_ of final causes. And, more especially,
11174: as regards the reference (necessary for us by the constitution of our
11175: Reason) of natural purposes to an intelligent World Cause, we have _one
11176: principle_ enabling us to think the nature and properties of this First
11177: Cause as supreme ground in the kingdom of purposes, and to determine
11178: its concept. This physical Teleology could not do; it could only lead
11179: to indeterminate concepts thereof, unserviceable alike in theoretical
11180: and in practical use.
11181: 
11182: From the principle, thus determined, of the causality of the Original
11183: Being we must not think Him merely as Intelligence and as legislative
11184: for nature, but also as legislating supremely in a moral kingdom of
11185: purposes. In reference to the _highest good_, alone possible under
11186: His sovereignty, viz. the existence of rational beings under moral
11187: laws, we shall think this Original Being as _all-knowing_: thus our
11188: inmost dispositions (which constitute the proper moral worth of the
11189: actions of rational beings of the world) will not be hid from Him.
11190: We shall think Him as _all-mighty_: thus He will be able to make the
11191: whole of nature accord with this highest purpose. We shall think Him
11192: as _all-good_, and at the same time as _just_: because these two
11193: properties (which when united constitute _Wisdom_) are the conditions
11194: of the causality of a supreme Cause of the world, as highest good,
11195: under moral laws. So also all the other transcendental properties,
11196: such as _Eternity_, _Omnipresence_, etc. [for goodness and justice are
11197: moral properties[132]], which are presupposed in reference to such a
11198: final purpose, must be thought in Him.--In this way _moral Teleology_
11199: supplies the deficiency in _physical Teleology_, and first establishes
11200: a _Theology_; because the latter, if it did not borrow from the former
11201: without being observed, but were to proceed consistently, could only
11202: found a _Demonology_, which is incapable of any definite concept.
11203: 
11204: But the principle of the reference of the world to a supreme Cause, as
11205: Deity, on account of the moral purposive destination of certain beings
11206: in it, does not accomplish this by completing the physico-teleological
11207: ground of proof and so taking this necessarily as its basis. It is
11208: sufficient _in itself_ and directs attention to the purposes of
11209: nature and the investigation of that incomprehensible great art lying
11210: hidden behind its forms, in order to confirm incidentally by means of
11211: natural purposes the Ideas that pure practical Reason furnishes. For
11212: the concept of beings of the world under moral laws is a principle
11213: (_a priori_) according to which man must of necessity judge himself.
11214: Further, if there is in general a World Cause acting designedly and
11215: directed towards a purpose, this moral relation must be just as
11216: necessarily the condition of the possibility of a creation, as that
11217: in accordance with physical laws (if, that is, this intelligent Cause
11218: has also a final purpose). This is regarded _a priori_ by Reason as a
11219: necessary fundamental proposition for it in its teleological judging
11220: of the existence of things. It now only comes to this, whether we have
11221: sufficient ground for Reason (either speculative or practical) to
11222: ascribe to the supreme Cause, acting in accordance with purposes, a
11223: _final purpose_. For it may _a priori_ be taken by us as certain that
11224: this, by the subjective constitution of our Reason and even of the
11225: Reason of other beings as far as we can think it, can be nothing else
11226: than _man under moral laws_: since otherwise the purposes of nature in
11227: the physical order could not be known _a priori_, especially as it can
11228: in no way be seen that nature could not exist without such purposes.
11229: 
11230: 
11231: _Remark_
11232: 
11233: Suppose the case of a man at the moment when his mind is disposed to a
11234: moral sensation. If surrounded by the beauties of nature, he is in a
11235: state of restful, serene enjoyment of his being, he feels a want, viz.
11236: to be grateful for this to some being or other. Or if another time he
11237: finds himself in the same state of mind when pressed by duties that he
11238: can and will only adequately discharge by a voluntary sacrifice, he
11239: again feels in himself a want, viz. to have thus executed a command
11240: and obeyed a Supreme Lord. Or, again; if he has in some heedless way
11241: transgressed his duty, but without becoming answerable to men, his
11242: severe self-reproach will speak to him with the voice of a judge to
11243: whom he has to give account. In a word, he needs a moral Intelligence,
11244: in order to have a Being for the purpose of his existence, which may
11245: be, conformably to this purpose, the cause of himself and of the
11246: world. It is vain to assign motives behind these feelings, for they
11247: are immediately connected with the purest moral sentiment, because
11248: _gratitude_, _obedience_, and _humiliation_ (submission to deserved
11249: chastisement) are mental dispositions that make for duty; and the mind
11250: which is inclined towards a widening of its moral sentiment here only
11251: voluntarily conceives an object that is not in the world in order where
11252: possible to render its duty before such an one. It is therefore at
11253: least possible and grounded too in our moral disposition to represent
11254: a pure moral need of the existence of a Being, by which our morality
11255: gains strength or even (at least according to our representation) more
11256: scope, viz. a new object for its exercise. That is, [there is a need]
11257: to assume a morally-legislating Being outside the world, without any
11258: reference to theoretical proofs, still less to self-interest, from pure
11259: moral grounds free from all foreign influence (and consequently only
11260: subjective), on the mere recommendation of a pure practical Reason
11261: legislating by itself alone. And although such a mental disposition
11262: might seldom occur or might not last long, but be transient and without
11263: permanent effect, or might even pass away without any meditation on the
11264: object represented in such shadowy outline, or without care to bring
11265: it under clear concepts--there is yet here unmistakably the ground why
11266: our moral capacity, as a subjective principle, should not be contented
11267: in its contemplation of the world with its purposiveness by means of
11268: natural causes, but should ascribe to it a supreme Cause governing
11269: nature according to moral principles.--In addition, we feel ourselves
11270: constrained by the moral law to strive for a universal highest purpose
11271: which yet we, in common with the rest of nature, are incapable of
11272: attaining; and it is only so far as we strive for it that we can judge
11273: ourselves to be in harmony with the final purpose of an intelligent
11274: World Cause (if such there be). Thus is found a pure moral ground
11275: of practical Reason for assuming this Cause (since it can be done
11276: without contradiction), in order that we may no more regard that effort
11277: of Reason as quite idle, and so run the risk of abandoning it from
11278: weariness.
11279: 
11280: With all this, so much only is to be said, that though _fear_ first
11281: produces _gods_ (demons), it is _Reason_ by means of its moral
11282: principles that can first produce the concept of _God_ (even when, as
11283: commonly is the case, one is unskilled in the Teleology of nature,
11284: or is very doubtful on account of the difficulty of adjusting by
11285: a sufficiently established principle its mutually contradictory
11286: phenomena). Also, the inner _moral_ purposive destination of man’s
11287: being supplies that in which natural knowledge is deficient, by
11288: directing us to think, for the final purpose of the being of all things
11289: (for which no other principle than an _ethical_ one is satisfactory to
11290: Reason), the supreme Cause [as endowed] with properties, whereby it is
11291: able to subject the whole of nature to that single design (for which
11292: nature is merely the instrument),--_i.e._ to think it as a _Deity_.
11293: 
11294: 
11295: § 87. _Of the moral proof of the Being of God_
11296: 
11297: There is a _physical Teleology_, which gives sufficient ground of
11298: proof to our theoretical reflective Judgement to assume the being of
11299: an intelligent World-Cause. But we find also in ourselves and still
11300: more in the concept of a rational being in general endowed with freedom
11301: (of his causality) a _moral Teleology_. However, as the purposive
11302: reference, together with its law, is determined _a priori_ in ourselves
11303: and therefore can be cognised as necessary, this internal conformity
11304: to law requires no intelligent cause external to us; any more than we
11305: need look to a highest Understanding as the source of the purposiveness
11306: (for every possible exercise of art) that we find in the geometrical
11307: properties of figures. But this moral Teleology concerns us as beings
11308: of the world, and therefore as beings bound up with other things in the
11309: world; upon which latter, whether as purposes or as objects in respect
11310: of which we ourselves are final purpose, the same moral laws require
11311: us to pass judgement. This moral Teleology, then, has to do with the
11312: reference of our own causality to purposes and even to a final purpose
11313: that we must aim at in the world, as well as with the reciprocal
11314: reference of the world to that moral purpose, and the external
11315: possibility of its accomplishment (to which no physical Teleology can
11316: lead us). Hence the question necessarily arises, whether it compels
11317: our rational judgement to go beyond the world and seek an intelligent
11318: supreme principle for that reference of nature to the moral in us; in
11319: order to represent nature as purposive even in reference to our inner
11320: moral legislation and its possible accomplishment. There is therefore
11321: certainly a moral Teleology, which is connected on the one hand with
11322: the _nomothetic_ of freedom and on the other with that of nature; just
11323: as necessarily as civil legislation is connected with the question
11324: where the executive authority is to be sought, and in general in every
11325: case [with the question] wherein Reason is to furnish a principle
11326: of the actuality of a certain regular order of things only possible
11327: according to Ideas.-- We shall first set forth the progress of Reason
11328: from that moral Teleology and its reference to physical, to _Theology_;
11329: and then make some observations upon the possibility and the validity
11330: of this way of reasoning.
11331: 
11332: If we assume the being of certain things (or even only certain forms of
11333: things) to be contingent and so to be possible only through something
11334: else which is their cause, we may seek for the unconditioned ground of
11335: this causality of the supreme (and so of the conditioned) either in
11336: the physical or the teleological order (either according to the _nexus
11337: effectivus_ or the _nexus finalis_). That is, we may either ask, what
11338: is the supreme productive cause of these things; or what is their
11339: supreme (absolutely unconditioned) purpose, _i.e._ the final purpose of
11340: that cause in its production of this or all its products generally? In
11341: the second case it is plainly presupposed that this cause is capable
11342: of representing purposes to itself, and consequently is an intelligent
11343: Being; at least it must be thought as acting in accordance with the
11344: laws of such a being.
11345: 
11346: If we follow the latter order, it is a FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITION to
11347: which even the commonest human Reason is compelled to give immediate
11348: assent, that if there is to be in general a _final purpose_ furnished
11349: _a priori_ by Reason, this can be no other than _man_ (every rational
11350: being of the world) _under moral laws_.[133] For (and so every one
11351: judges) if the world consisted of mere lifeless, or even in part of
11352: living but irrational, beings, its existence would have no worth
11353: because in it there would be no being who would have the least concept
11354: of what worth is. Again, if there were intelligent beings, whose
11355: Reason were only able to place the worth of the existence of things
11356: in the relation of nature to themselves (their well-being), but not
11357: to furnish of itself an original worth (in freedom), then there would
11358: certainly be (relative) purposes in the world, but no (absolute) final
11359: purpose, because the existence of such rational beings would be always
11360: purposeless. But the moral laws have this peculiar characteristic that
11361: they prescribe to Reason something as a purpose without any condition,
11362: and consequently exactly as the concept of a final purpose requires.
11363: The existence of a Reason that can be for itself the supreme law in the
11364: purposive reference, in other words the existence of rational beings
11365: under moral laws, can therefore alone be thought as the final purpose
11366: of the being of a world. If on the contrary this be not so, there would
11367: be either no purpose at all in the cause of its being, or there would
11368: be purposes, but no final purpose.
11369: 
11370: The moral law as the formal rational condition of the use of our
11371: freedom obliges us by itself alone, without depending on any purpose as
11372: material condition; but it nevertheless determines for us, and indeed
11373: _a priori_, a final purpose towards which it obliges us to strive;
11374: and this purpose is the _highest good in the world_ possible through
11375: freedom.
11376: 
11377: The subjective condition under which man (and, according to all our
11378: concepts, every rational finite being) can set a final purpose before
11379: himself under the above law is happiness. Consequently, the highest
11380: physical good possible in the world, to be furthered as a final purpose
11381: as far as in us lies, is _happiness_, under the objective condition of
11382: the harmony of man with the law of _morality_ as worthiness to be happy.
11383: 
11384: But it is impossible for us in accordance with all our rational
11385: faculties to represent these two requirements of the final purpose
11386: proposed to us by the moral law, as _connected_ by merely natural
11387: causes, and yet as conformable to the Idea of that final purpose. Hence
11388: the concept of the _practical necessity_ of such a purpose through
11389: the application of our powers does not harmonise with the theoretical
11390: concept of the _physical possibility_ of working it out, if we connect
11391: with our freedom no other causality (as a means) than that of nature.
11392: 
11393: Consequently, we must assume a moral World-Cause (an Author of the
11394: world), in order to set before ourselves a final purpose consistently
11395: with the moral law; and in so far as the latter is necessary, so far
11396: (_i.e._ in the same degree and on the same ground) the former also must
11397: be necessarily assumed; _i.e._ we must admit that there is a God.[134]
11398: 
11399: This proof, to which we can easily give the form of logical precision,
11400: does not say: it is as necessary to assume the Being of God as to
11401: recognise the validity of the moral law; and consequently he who
11402: cannot convince himself of the first, can judge himself free from the
11403: obligations of the second. No! there must in such case only be given
11404: up the _aiming at_ the final purpose in the world, to be brought about
11405: by the pursuit of the second (viz. a happiness of rational beings
11406: in harmony with the pursuit of moral laws, regarded as the highest
11407: good). Every rational being would yet have to cognise himself as
11408: straitly bound by the precepts of morality, for its laws are formal
11409: and command unconditionally without respect to purposes (as the matter
11410: of volition). But the one requisite of the final purpose, as practical
11411: Reason prescribes it to beings of the world, is an irresistible purpose
11412: imposed on them by their nature (as finite beings), which Reason wishes
11413: to know as subject only to the moral law as inviolable _condition_, or
11414: even as universally set up in accordance with it. Thus Reason takes for
11415: final purpose the furthering of happiness in harmony with morality. To
11416: further this so far as is in our power (_i.e._ in respect of happiness)
11417: is commanded us by the moral law; be the issue of this endeavour what
11418: it may. The fulfilling of duty consists in the form of the earnest
11419: will, not in the intermediate causes of success.
11420: 
11421: Suppose then that partly through the weakness of all the speculative
11422: arguments so highly extolled, and partly through many irregularities
11423: in nature and the world of sense which come before him, a man is
11424: persuaded of the proposition, There is no God; he would nevertheless be
11425: contemptible in his own eyes if on that account he were to imagine the
11426: laws of duty as empty, invalid and inobligatory, and wished to resolve
11427: to transgress them boldly. Such an one, even if he could be convinced
11428: in the sequel of that which he had doubted at the first, would always
11429: be contemptible while having such a disposition, although he should
11430: fulfil his duty as regards its [external] effect as punctiliously
11431: as could be desired, for [he would be acting] from fear or from the
11432: aim at recompense, without the sentiment of reverence for duty. If,
11433: conversely, as a believer [in God] he performs his duty according
11434: to his conscience, uprightly and disinterestedly, and nevertheless
11435: believes that he is free from all moral obligation so soon as he is
11436: convinced that there is no God, this could accord but badly with an
11437: inner moral disposition.
11438: 
11439: We may then suppose the case of a righteous man [_e.g. Spinoza_],[135]
11440: who holds himself firmly persuaded that there is no God, and also
11441: (because in respect of the Object of morality a similar consequence
11442: results) no future life; how is he to judge of his own inner purposive
11443: destination, by means of the moral law, which he reveres in practice?
11444: He desires no advantage to himself from following it, either in this
11445: or another world; he wishes, rather, disinterestedly to establish
11446: the good to which that holy law directs all his powers. But his
11447: effort is bounded; and from nature, although he may expect here and
11448: there a contingent accordance, he can never expect a regular harmony
11449: agreeing according to constant rules (such as his maxims are and must
11450: be, internally), with the purpose that he yet feels himself obliged
11451: and impelled to accomplish. Deceit, violence, and envy will always
11452: surround him, although he himself be honest, peaceable, and kindly; and
11453: the righteous men with whom he meets will, notwithstanding all their
11454: worthiness of happiness, be yet subjected by nature which regards not
11455: this, to all the evils of want, disease, and untimely death, just like
11456: the beasts of the earth. So it will be until one wide grave engulfs
11457: them together (honest or not, it makes no difference), and throws
11458: them back--who were able to believe themselves the final purpose of
11459: creation--into the abyss of the purposeless chaos of matter from which
11460: they were drawn.-- The purpose, then, which this well-intentioned
11461: person had and ought to have before him in his pursuit of moral laws,
11462: he must certainly give up as impossible. Or else, if he wishes to
11463: remain dependent upon the call of his moral internal destination,
11464: and not to weaken the respect with which the moral law immediately
11465: inspires him, by assuming the nothingness of the single, ideal, final
11466: purpose adequate to its high demand (which cannot be brought about
11467: without a violation of moral sentiment), he must, as he well can--since
11468: there is at least no contradiction from a practical point of view in
11469: forming a concept of the possibility of a morally prescribed final
11470: purpose--assume the being of a _moral_ author of the world, that is, a
11471: God.
11472: 
11473: 
11474: § 88. _Limitation of the validity of the moral proof_
11475: 
11476: Pure Reason, as a practical faculty, _i.e._ as the faculty of
11477: determining the free use of our causality by Ideas (pure rational
11478: concepts), not only comprises in the moral law a regulative principle
11479: of our actions, but supplies us at the same time with a subjective
11480: constitutive principle in the concept of an Object which Reason
11481: alone can think, and which is to be actualised by our actions in
11482: the world according to that law. The Idea of a final purpose in the
11483: employment of freedom according to moral laws has therefore subjective
11484: _practical_ reality. We are _a priori_ determined by Reason to promote
11485: with all our powers the _summum bonum_ [Weltbeste] which consists in
11486: the combination of the greatest welfare of rational beings with the
11487: highest condition of the good in itself, _i.e._ in universal happiness
11488: conjoined with morality most accordant to law. In this final purpose
11489: the possibility of one part, happiness, is empirically conditioned,
11490: _i.e._ dependent on the constitution of nature (which may or may not
11491: agree with this purpose) and is in a theoretical aspect problematical;
11492: whilst the other part, morality, in respect of which we are free from
11493: the effects of nature, stands fast _a priori_ as to its possibility,
11494: and is dogmatically certain. It is then requisite for the objective
11495: theoretical reality of the concept of the final purpose of rational
11496: beings, that we should not only have _a priori_ presupposed a final
11497: purpose for ourselves, but also that the creation, _i.e._ the world
11498: itself, should have as regards its existence a final purpose, which if
11499: it could be proved _a priori_ would add objectivity to the subjective
11500: reality of the final purpose [of rational beings]. For if the creation
11501: has on the whole a final purpose, we cannot think it otherwise than as
11502: harmonising with the moral purpose (which alone makes the concept of a
11503: purpose possible). Now we find without doubt purposes in the world, and
11504: physical Teleology exhibits them in such abundance, that if we judge
11505: in accordance with Reason, we have ground for assuming as a principle
11506: in the investigation of nature that nothing in nature is without a
11507: purpose; but the final purpose of nature we seek there in vain. This
11508: can and must therefore, as its Idea only lies in Reason, be sought as
11509: regards its objective possibility only in rational beings. And the
11510: practical Reason of these latter not only supplies this final purpose;
11511: it also determines this concept in respect of the conditions under
11512: which alone a final purpose of creation can be thought by us.
11513: 
11514: The question is now, whether the objective reality of the concept
11515: of a final purpose of creation cannot be exhibited adequately to the
11516: theoretical requirements of pure Reason--if not apodictically for the
11517: determinant Judgement yet adequately for the maxims of the theoretical
11518: reflective Judgement? This is the least one could expect from
11519: theoretical philosophy, which undertakes to combine the moral purpose
11520: with natural purposes by means of the Idea of one single purpose; but
11521: yet this little is far more than it can accomplish.
11522: 
11523: According to the principle of the theoretical reflective Judgement we
11524: should say: if we have ground for assuming for the purposive products
11525: of nature a supreme Cause of nature--whose causality in respect of the
11526: actuality of creation is of a different kind from that required for
11527: the mechanism of nature, _i.e._ must be thought as the causality of
11528: an Understanding--we have also sufficient ground for thinking in this
11529: original Being not merely the purposes everywhere in nature but also
11530: a final purpose. This is not indeed a final purpose by which we can
11531: explain the presence of such a Being, but one of which we may at least
11532: convince ourselves (as was the case in physical Teleology) that we can
11533: make the possibility of such a world conceivable, not merely according
11534: to purposes, but only through the fact that we ascribe to its existence
11535: a final purpose.
11536: 
11537: But a final purpose is merely a concept of our practical Reason,
11538: and can be inferred from no data of experience for the theoretical
11539: judging of nature, nor can it be applied to the cognition of nature.
11540: No use of this concept is possible except its use for practical Reason
11541: according to moral laws; and the final purpose of creation is that
11542: constitution of the world which harmonises with that which alone we
11543: can put forward definitely according to laws, viz. the final purpose of
11544: our pure practical Reason, in so far as it is to be practical.-- Now
11545: we have in the moral law, which enjoins on us in a practical point of
11546: view the application of our powers to the accomplishment of this final
11547: purpose, a ground for assuming its possibility and practicability, and
11548: consequently too (because without the concurrence of nature with a
11549: condition not in our power, its accomplishment would be impossible) a
11550: nature of things harmonious with it. Hence we have a moral ground for
11551: thinking in a world also a final purpose of creation.
11552: 
11553: We have not yet advanced from moral Teleology to a Theology, _i.e._ to
11554: the being of a moral Author of the world, but only to a final purpose
11555: of creation which is determined in this way. But in order to account
11556: for this creation, _i.e._ the existence of things, in accordance with
11557: a _final purpose_, we must assume not only first an intelligent Being
11558: (for the possibility of things of nature which we are compelled to
11559: judge of as _purposes_), but also a _moral_ Being, as author of the
11560: world, _i.e._ a _God_. This second conclusion is of such a character
11561: that we see it holds merely for the Judgement according to concepts
11562: of practical Reason, and as such for the reflective and not the
11563: determinant Judgement. It is true that in us morally practical Reason
11564: is essentially different in its principles from technically practical
11565: Reason. But we cannot assume that it must be so likewise in the supreme
11566: World-Cause, regarded as Intelligence, and that a peculiar mode of
11567: its causality is requisite for the final purpose, different from that
11568: which is requisite merely for purposes of nature. We cannot therefore
11569: assume that in our final purpose we have not merely a _moral ground_
11570: for admitting a final purpose of creation (as an effect), but also
11571: for admitting a _moral Being_ as the original ground of creation. But
11572: we may well say, that, _according to the constitution of our rational
11573: faculty_, we cannot comprehend the possibility of such a purposiveness
11574: _in respect of the moral law_, and its Object, as there is in this
11575: final purpose, apart from an Author and Governor of the world, who is
11576: at the same time its moral Lawgiver.
11577: 
11578: The actuality of a highest morally-legislating Author is therefore
11579: sufficiently established merely _for the practical use_ of our Reason,
11580: without determining anything theoretically as regards its being. For
11581: Reason requires, in respect of the possibility of its purpose, which
11582: is given to us independently by its own legislation, an Idea through
11583: which the inability to follow up this purpose, according to the mere
11584: natural concepts of the world, is removed (sufficiently for the
11585: reflective Judgement). Thus this Idea gains practical reality, although
11586: all means of creating such for it in a theoretical point of view, for
11587: the explanation of nature and determination of the supreme Cause,
11588: are entirely wanting for speculative cognition. For the theoretical
11589: reflective Judgement physical Teleology sufficiently proves from the
11590: purposes of nature an intelligent World-Cause; for the practical
11591: Judgement moral Teleology establishes it by the concept of a final
11592: purpose, which it is forced to ascribe to creation in a practical
11593: point of view. The objective reality of the Idea of God, as moral
11594: Author of the world, cannot, it is true, be established by physical
11595: purposes _alone_. But nevertheless, if the cognition of these purposes
11596: is combined with that of the moral purpose, they are, by virtue of the
11597: maxim of pure Reason which bids us seek unity of principles so far as
11598: is possible, of great importance for the practical reality of that
11599: Idea, by bringing in the reality which it has for the Judgement in a
11600: theoretical point of view.
11601: 
11602: To prevent a misunderstanding which may easily arise, it is in the
11603: highest degree needful to remark that, in the first place, we can
11604: _think_ these properties of the highest Being only according to
11605: analogy. How indeed could we explore the nature of that, to which
11606: experience can show us nothing similar? Secondly, in this way we only
11607: think the supreme Being; we cannot thereby _cognise_ Him and ascribe
11608: anything theoretically to Him. It would be needful for the determinant
11609: Judgement in the speculative aspect of our Reason, to consider what
11610: the supreme World-Cause is in Himself. But here we are only concerned
11611: with the question what concept we can form of Him, according to the
11612: constitution of our cognitive faculties; and whether we have to assume
11613: His existence in order merely to furnish practical reality to a
11614: purpose, which pure Reason without any such presupposition enjoins upon
11615: us _a priori_ to bring about with all our powers, _i.e._ in order to
11616: be able to think as possible a designed effect. Although that concept
11617: may be transcendent for the speculative Reason, and the properties
11618: which we ascribe to the Being thereby thought may, objectively used,
11619: conceal an anthropomorphism in themselves; yet the design of its use
11620: is not to determine the nature of that Being which is unattainable by
11621: us, but to determine ourselves and our will accordingly. We may call
11622: a cause after the concept which we have of its effect (though only
11623: in reference to this relation), without thereby meaning to determine
11624: internally its inner constitution, by means of the properties which
11625: can be made known to us solely by similar causes and must be given in
11626: experience. For example, amongst other properties we ascribe to the
11627: soul a _vis locomotiva_ because bodily movements actually arise whose
11628: cause lies in the representation of them; without therefore meaning
11629: to ascribe to it the only mode [of action] that we know in moving
11630: forces (viz. by attraction, pressure, impulse, and consequently motion,
11631: which always presuppose an extended being). Just so we must assume
11632: _something_, which contains the ground of the possibility and practical
11633: reality, _i.e._ the practicability, of a necessary moral final purpose;
11634: but we can think of this, in accordance with the character of the
11635: effect expected of it, as a wise Being governing the world according
11636: to moral laws, and, conformably to the constitution of our cognitive
11637: faculties, as a cause of things distinct from nature, only in order
11638: to express the _relation_ of this Being (which transcends all our
11639: cognitive faculties) to the Objects of _our_ practical Reason. We do
11640: not pretend thus to ascribe to it theoretically the only causality of
11641: this kind known to us, viz. an Understanding and a Will: we do not
11642: even pretend to distinguish objectively the causality thought in this
11643: Being, as regards what is _for us_ final purpose, from the causality
11644: thought in it as regards nature (and its purposive determinations in
11645: general). We can only assume this distinction as subjectively necessary
11646: by the constitution of our cognitive faculties, and as valid for the
11647: reflective, not for the objectively determinant Judgement. But if we
11648: come to practice, then such a _regulative_ principle (of prudence or
11649: wisdom) [commanding us] to act conformably to that as purpose, which
11650: by the constitution of our cognitive faculties can only be thought
11651: as possible in a certain way, is at the same _constitutive_, _i.e._
11652: practically determinant. Nevertheless, as a principle for judging
11653: of the objective possibility of things, it is no way theoretically
11654: determinant (_i.e._ it does not say that the only kind of possibility
11655: which belongs to the Object is that which belongs to our thinking
11656: faculty), but is a mere _regulative_ principle for the reflective
11657: Judgement.
11658: 
11659: 
11660: _Remark_
11661: 
11662: This moral proof is not one newly discovered, although perhaps its
11663: basis is newly set forth; since it has lain in man’s rational faculty
11664: from its earliest germ, and is only continually developed with its
11665: advancing cultivation. So soon as men begin to reflect upon right and
11666: wrong--at a time when, quite indifferent as to the purposiveness of
11667: nature, they avail themselves of it without thinking anything more of
11668: it than that it is the accustomed course of nature--this judgement is
11669: inevitable, viz. that the issue cannot be the same, whether a man has
11670: behaved candidly or falsely, fairly or violently, even though up to his
11671: life’s end, as far as can be seen, he has met with no happiness for
11672: his virtues, no punishment for his vices. It is as if they perceived a
11673: voice within [saying] that the issue must be different. And so there
11674: must lie hidden in them a representation, however obscure, of something
11675: after which they feel themselves bound to strive; with which such a
11676: result would not agree,--with which, if they looked upon the course of
11677: the world as the only order of things, they could not harmonise that
11678: inner purposive determination of their minds. Now they might represent
11679: in various rude fashions the way in which such an irregularity could
11680: be adjusted (an irregularity which must be far more revolting to the
11681: human mind than the blind chance that we are sometimes willing to use
11682: as a principle for judging of nature). But they could never think
11683: any other principle of the possibility of the unification of nature
11684: with its inner ethical laws, than a supreme Cause governing the world
11685: according to moral laws; because a final purpose in them proposed as
11686: duty, and a nature without any final purpose beyond them in which that
11687: purpose might be actualised, would involve a contradiction. As to the
11688: [inner][136] constitution of that World-Cause they could contrive much
11689: nonsense. But that moral relation in the government of the world would
11690: remain always the same, which by the uncultivated Reason, considered
11691: as practical, is universally comprehensible, but with which the
11692: speculative Reason can make far from the like advance.--And in all
11693: probability attention would be directed first by this moral interest to
11694: the beauty and the purposes in nature, which would serve excellently
11695: to strengthen this Idea though they could not be the foundation of it.
11696: Still less could that moral interest be dispensed with, because it is
11697: only in reference to the final purpose that the investigation of the
11698: purposes of nature acquires that immediate interest which displays
11699: itself in such a great degree in the admiration of them without any
11700: reference to the advantage to be derived from them.
11701: 
11702: 
11703: § 89. _Of the use of the moral argument_
11704: 
11705: The limitation of Reason in respect of all our Ideas of the
11706: supersensible to the conditions of its practical employment has, as
11707: far as the Idea of God is concerned, undeniable uses. For it prevents
11708: _Theology_ from rising into THEOSOPHY (into transcendent concepts which
11709: confound Reason), or from sinking into DEMONOLOGY (an anthropomorphic
11710: way of representing the highest Being). And it also prevents _Religion_
11711: from turning into _Theurgy_ (a fanatical belief that we can have a
11712: feeling of other supersensible beings and can reciprocally influence
11713: them), or into _Idolatry_ (a superstitious belief that we can please
11714: the Supreme Being by other means than by a moral sentiment).[137]
11715: 
11716: For if we permit the vanity or the presumption of sophistry to
11717: determine the least thing theoretically (in a way that extends our
11718: knowledge) in respect of what lies beyond the world of sense, or
11719: if we allow any pretence to be made of insight into the being and
11720: constitution of the nature of God, of His Understanding and Will, of
11721: the laws of both and of His properties which thus affect the world,
11722: I should like to know where and at what point we will bound these
11723: assumptions of Reason. For wherever such insight can be derived, there
11724: may yet more be expected (if we only strain our reflection, as we have
11725: a mind to do). Bounds must then be put to such claims according to a
11726: certain principle, and not merely because we find that all attempts
11727: of the sort have hitherto failed, for that proves nothing against the
11728: possibility of a better result. But here no principle is possible,
11729: except either to assume that in respect of the supersensible absolutely
11730: nothing can be theoretically determined (except mere negations);
11731: or else that our Reason contains in itself a yet unused mine of
11732: cognitions, reaching no one knows how far, stored up for ourselves and
11733: our posterity.--But as concerns Religion, _i.e._ morals in reference
11734: to God as legislator, if the theoretical cognition of Him is to come
11735: first, morals must be adjusted in accordance with Theology; and not
11736: only is an external arbitrary legislation of a Supreme Being introduced
11737: in place of an internal necessary legislation of Reason, but also
11738: whatever is defective in our insight into the nature of this Being
11739: must extend to ethical precepts, and thus make Religion immoral and
11740: perverted.
11741: 
11742: As regards the hope of a future life, if instead of the final purpose
11743: we have to accomplish in conformity with the precept of the moral law,
11744: we ask of our theoretical faculty of cognition a clue for the judgement
11745: of Reason upon our destination (which clue is only considered as
11746: necessary or worthy of acceptance in a practical reference), then in
11747: this aspect Psychology, like Theology, gives no more than a negative
11748: concept of our thinking being. That is, none of its actions or of the
11749: phenomena of the internal sense can be explained materialistically; and
11750: hence of its separate nature and of the continuance or non-continuance
11751: of its personality after death absolutely no ampliative determinant
11752: judgement is possible on speculative grounds by means of our whole
11753: theoretical cognitive faculty. Here then everything is handed over to
11754: the teleological judging of our existence in a practically necessary
11755: aspect, and to the assumption of our continuance as a condition
11756: requisite for the final purpose absolutely furnished by Reason. And so
11757: this advantage (which indeed at first glance seems to be a loss) is
11758: apparent; that, as Theology for us can never be Theosophy, or rational
11759: _Psychology_ become _Pneumatology_--an ampliative science--so on the
11760: other hand this latter is assured of never falling into _Materialism_.
11761: Psychology, rather, is a mere anthropology of the internal sense,
11762: _i.e._ is the knowledge of our thinking self _in life_; and, as
11763: theoretical cognition, remains merely empirical. On the other hand,
11764: rational Psychology, as far as it is concerned with questions as to
11765: our eternal existence, is not a theoretical science at all, but rests
11766: on a single conclusion of moral Teleology; as also its whole use is
11767: necessary merely on account of the latter, _i.e._ on account of our
11768: practical destination.
11769: 
11770: 
11771: § 90. _Of the kind of belief in a teleological proof of the Being of
11772: God_
11773: 
11774: The first requisite for every proof, whether it be derived from the
11775: immediate empirical presentation (as in the proof from observation of
11776: the object or from experiment) of that which is to be proved, or by
11777: Reason _a priori_ from principles, is this. It should not _persuade_,
11778: but _convince_,[138] or at least should tend to conviction. _I.e._ the
11779: ground of proof or the conclusion should not be merely a subjective
11780: (aesthetical) determining ground of assent (mere illusion), but
11781: objectively valid and a logical ground of cognition; for otherwise
11782: the Understanding is ensnared, but not convinced. Such an illusory
11783: proof is that which, perhaps with good intent but yet with wilful
11784: concealment of its weaknesses, is adduced in Natural Theology. In this
11785: we bring in the great number of indications of the origin of natural
11786: things according to the principle of purposes, and take advantage
11787: of the merely subjective basis of human Reason, viz. its special
11788: propensity to think only one principle instead of several, whenever
11789: this can be done without contradiction; and, when in this principle
11790: only one or more requisites for determining a concept are furnished, to
11791: add in our thought these additional [features] so as to complete the
11792: concept of the thing by arbitrarily supplementing it. For, in truth,
11793: when we meet with so many products in nature which are to us marks of
11794: an intelligent cause, why should we not think One cause rather than
11795: many; and in this One, not merely great intelligence, power, etc.,
11796: but rather Omniscience, and Omnipotence--in a word, think it as a
11797: Cause that contains the sufficient ground of such properties in all
11798: possible things? Further, why should we not ascribe to this unique,
11799: all-powerful, original Being not only intelligence for natural laws
11800: and products, but also, as to a moral Cause of the world, supreme,
11801: ethical, practical Reason? For by this completion of the concept a
11802: sufficient principle is furnished both for insight into nature and
11803: for moral wisdom; and no objection grounded in any way can be made
11804: against the possibility of such an Idea. If now at the same time
11805: the moral motives of the mind are aroused, and a lively interest in
11806: the latter is added by the force of eloquence (of which they are
11807: indeed very worthy), then there arises therefrom a persuasion of the
11808: objective adequacy of the proof; and also (in most cases of its use)
11809: a wholesome illusion which quite dispenses with all examination of
11810: its logical strictness, and even on the contrary regards this with
11811: abhorrence and dislike as if an impious doubt lay at its basis.--Now
11812: against this there is indeed nothing to say, so long as we only have
11813: regard to its popular usefulness. But then the division of the proof
11814: into the two dissimilar parts involved in the argument--belonging to
11815: physical and moral Teleology respectively--cannot and must not be
11816: prevented. For the blending of these makes it impossible to discern
11817: where the proper force of the proof lies, and in what part and how it
11818: must be elaborated in order that its validity may be able to stand the
11819: strictest examination (even if we should be compelled to admit in one
11820: part the weakness of our rational insight). Thus it is the duty of
11821: the philosopher (supposing even that he counts as nothing the claims
11822: of sincerity) to expose the above illusion, however wholesome it is,
11823: which such a confusion can produce; and to distinguish what merely
11824: belongs to persuasion from that which leads to conviction (for these
11825: are determinations of assent which differ not merely in degree but in
11826: kind), in order to present plainly the state of the mind in this proof
11827: in its whole clearness, and to be able to subject it frankly to the
11828: closest examination.
11829: 
11830: But a proof which is intended to convince, can again be of two kinds;
11831: either deciding what the object is _in itself_, or what it is _for us_
11832: (for men in general) according to our necessary rational principles of
11833: judgement (proof κατ’ ἀλήθειαν or κατ’ ἄνθρωπον, the last word being
11834: taken in its universal signification of man in general). In the first
11835: case it is based on adequate principles for the determinant Judgement,
11836: in the second for the reflective Judgement. In the latter case it
11837: can never, when resting on merely theoretical principles, tend to
11838: conviction; but if a practical principle of Reason (which is therefore
11839: universally and necessarily valid) lies at its basis, it may certainly
11840: lay claim to conviction adequate in a pure practical point of view,
11841: _i.e._ to moral conviction. But a proof _tends to conviction_, though
11842: without convincing, if it is [merely][139] brought on the way thereto;
11843: _i.e._ if it contains in itself only objective grounds, which although
11844: not attaining to certainty are yet of such a kind that they do not
11845: serve merely for persuasion as subjective grounds of the judgement.[140]
11846: 
11847: All theoretical grounds of proof resolve themselves either into: (1)
11848: Proofs by logically strict _Syllogisms of Reason_; or where this is not
11849: the case, (2) _Conclusions_ according to _analogy_; or where this also
11850: has no place, (3) _Probable opinion_; or finally, which has the least
11851: weight, (4) Assumption of a merely possible ground of explanation,
11852: _i.e._ _Hypothesis_.--Now I say that all grounds of proof in general,
11853: which aim at theoretical conviction, can bring about no belief of this
11854: kind from the highest to the lowest degree, if there is to be proved
11855: the proposition of the _existence_ of an original Being, as a God, in
11856: the signification adequate to the whole content of this concept; viz. a
11857: _moral_ Author of the world, by whom the final purpose of creation is
11858: at the same time supplied.
11859: 
11860: (1.) As to the _logically accurate_ proof proceeding from universal
11861: to particular, we have sufficiently established in the Critique
11862: the following: Since no intuition possible for us corresponds to
11863: the concept of a Being that is to be sought beyond nature--whose
11864: concept therefore, so far as it is to be theoretically determined by
11865: synthetical predicates, remains always problematical for us--there
11866: is absolutely no cognition of it to be had (by which the extent of
11867: our theoretical knowledge is in the least enlarged). The particular
11868: concept of a supersensible Being cannot be subsumed under the universal
11869: principles of the nature of things, in order to conclude from them to
11870: it, because those principles are valid simply for nature, as an object
11871: of sense.
11872: 
11873: (2.) We can indeed _think_ one of two dissimilar things, even in
11874: the very point of their dissimilarity, in accordance with the
11875: _analogy_[141] of the other; but we cannot, from that wherein they are
11876: dissimilar, _conclude_ from the one to the other by analogy, _i.e._
11877: transfer from the one to the other this sign of specific distinction.
11878: Thus I can, according to the analogy of the law of the equality of
11879: action and reaction in the mutual attraction and repulsion of bodies,
11880: also conceive of the association of the members of a commonwealth
11881: according to rules of right; but I cannot transfer to it those specific
11882: determinations (material attraction or repulsion), and ascribe them
11883: to the citizens in order to constitute a system called a state.--Just
11884: so we can indeed conceive of the causality of the original Being in
11885: respect of the things of the world, as natural purposes, according to
11886: the analogy of an Understanding, as ground of the forms of certain
11887: products which we call works of art (for this only takes place on
11888: behalf of the theoretical or practical use that we have to make by our
11889: cognitive faculty of this concept in respect of the natural things
11890: in the world according to a certain principle). But we can in no way
11891: conclude according to analogy, because in the case of beings of the
11892: world Understanding must be ascribed to the cause of an effect which
11893: is judged artificial, that in respect of nature the same causality
11894: which we perceive in men attaches also to the Being which is quite
11895: distinct from nature. For this concerns the very point of dissimilarity
11896: which is thought between a cause sensibly conditioned in respect of its
11897: effects and the supersensible original Being itself in our concept of
11898: it, and which therefore cannot be transferred from one to the other.--
11899: In the very fact that I must conceive the divine causality only
11900: according to the analogy of an Understanding (which faculty we know in
11901: no other being than in sensibly-conditioned man) lies the prohibition
11902: to ascribe to it this Understanding in its peculiar signification.[142]
11903: 
11904: (3.) _Opinion_ finds in _a priori_ judgements no place whatever, for
11905: by them we either cognise something as quite certain or else cognise
11906: nothing at all. But if the given grounds of proof from which we start
11907: (as here from the purposes in the world) are empirical, then we cannot
11908: even with their aid form any opinion as to anything beyond the world of
11909: sense, nor can we concede to such venturesome judgements the smallest
11910: claim to probability. For probability is part of a certainty possible
11911: in a certain series of grounds (its grounds compare with the sufficient
11912: ground as parts with a whole), the insufficient ground of which must
11913: be susceptible of completion. But since, as determining grounds of one
11914: and the same judgement, they must be of the same kind, for otherwise
11915: they would not together constitute a whole (such as certainty is), one
11916: part of them cannot lie within the bounds of possible experience and
11917: another outside all possible experience. Consequently, since merely
11918: empirical grounds of proof lead to nothing supersensible, and since
11919: what is lacking in the series of them cannot in any way be completed,
11920: we do not approach in the least nearer in our attempt to attain by
11921: their means to the supersensible and to a cognition thereof. Thus in
11922: any judgement about the latter by means of arguments derived from
11923: experience, probability has no place.
11924: 
11925: (4.) If an _hypothesis_ is to serve for the explanation of the
11926: possibility of a given phenomenon, at least its possibility must
11927: be completely certain.[143] It is sufficient that in an hypothesis
11928: I disclaim any cognition of actuality (which is claimed in an
11929: opinion given out as probable); more than this I cannot give up. The
11930: possibility of that which I place at the basis of my explanation,
11931: must at least be exposed to no doubt; otherwise there would be no end
11932: of empty chimeras. But to assume the possibility of a supersensible
11933: Being determined according to certain concepts would be a completely
11934: groundless supposition. For here none of the conditions requisite
11935: for cognition, as regards that in it which rests upon intuition, is
11936: given, and so the sole criterion of possibility remaining is the mere
11937: principle of Contradiction (which can only prove the possibility of the
11938: thought, not of the object thought).
11939: 
11940: The result then is this. For the existence [Dasein] of the original
11941: Being, as a Godhead, or of the soul as an immortal spirit, absolutely
11942: no proof in a theoretical point of view is possible for the human
11943: Reason, which can bring about even the least degree of belief. The
11944: ground of this is quite easy to comprehend. For determining our
11945: Ideas of the supersensible we have no material whatever, and we
11946: must derive this latter from things in the world of sense, which is
11947: absolutely inadequate for such an Object. Thus, in the absence of all
11948: determination of it, nothing remains but the concept of a non-sensible
11949: something which contains the ultimate ground of the world of sense, but
11950: which does not furnish any knowledge (any amplification of the concept)
11951: of its inner constitution.
11952: 
11953: 
11954: § 91. _Of the kind of belief produced by a practical faith_
11955: 
11956: If we look merely to the way in which anything can be _for us_
11957: (according to the subjective constitution of our representative powers)
11958: an Object of knowledge (_res cognoscibilis_), then our concepts will
11959: not cohere with Objects, but merely with our cognitive faculties and
11960: the use which they can make of a given representation (in a theoretical
11961: or practical point of view). Thus the question whether anything is or
11962: is not a cognisable being is not a question concerning the possibility
11963: of things but of our knowledge of them.
11964: 
11965: _Cognisable_ things are of three kinds: _things of opinion_
11966: (_opinabile_); _things of fact_ (_scibile_); and _things of faith_
11967: (_mere credibile_).
11968: 
11969: (1.) Objects of mere rational Ideas, which for theoretical knowledge
11970: cannot be presented in any possible experience, are so far not
11971: _cognisable_ things, and consequently in respect of them we can form
11972: no _opinion_; for to form an opinion _a priori_ is absurd in itself
11973: and the straight road to mere chimeras. Either then our proposition
11974: is certain _a priori_ or it contains nothing for belief. Therefore
11975: _things of opinion_ are always Objects of an empirical cognition at
11976: least possible in itself (objects of the world of sense); but, which,
11977: on account merely of the [low] degree of this faculty that we possess,
11978: is _for us_ impossible. Thus the ether of the new physicists,[144]
11979: an elastic fluid pervading all other matter (mingled intimately with
11980: it) is a mere thing of opinion, yet is such that, if our external
11981: senses were sharpened to the highest degree, it could be perceived;
11982: though it can never be presented in any observation or experiment.
11983: To assume [the existence of] rational inhabitants of other planets
11984: is a thing of opinion; for if we could come closer to them, which is
11985: in itself possible, we should decide by experience whether they did
11986: or did not exist; but as we shall never come so near, it remains in
11987: the region of opinion. But to hold the opinion that there are in the
11988: material universe pure thinking spirits without bodies (viz. if we
11989: dismiss as unworthy of our notice certain phenomena which have been
11990: published as actual[145]) is to be called poetic fiction. This is no
11991: thing of opinion, but a mere Idea which remains over, when we remove
11992: from a thinking being everything material, and only leave thought
11993: to it. Whether then the latter (which we know only in man, that is,
11994: in combination with a body) does survive, we cannot decide. Such a
11995: thing is a _sophistical being_ (_ens rationis ratiocinantis_), not a
11996: _rational being_ (_ens rationis ratiocinatae_)[146]; of which latter it
11997: is possible to show conclusively, the objective reality of its concept;
11998: at least for the practical use of Reason, because this which has its
11999: peculiar and apodictically certain principles _a priori_, demands
12000: (postulates) it.
12001: 
12002: (2.) Objects for concepts, whose objective reality can be proved
12003: (whether through pure Reason or through experience, and, in the first
12004: case, from its theoretical or practical data, in all cases by means of
12005: a corresponding intuition) are _things of fact_ (_res facti_).[147] Of
12006: this kind are the mathematical properties of magnitudes (in geometry),
12007: because they are susceptible of a _presentation a priori_ for the
12008: theoretical use of Reason. Further, things or their characteristics,
12009: which can be exhibited in experience (either our own or that of others
12010: through the medium of testimony) are likewise things of fact.--And,
12011: what is very remarkable, there is one rational Idea (susceptible in
12012: itself of no presentation in intuition, and consequently, of no
12013: theoretical proof of its possibility) which also comes under things of
12014: fact. This is the Idea of _freedom_, whose reality, regarded as that
12015: of a particular kind of causality (of which the concept, theoretically
12016: considered, would be transcendent), may be exhibited by means of
12017: practical laws of pure Reason, and conformably to this, in actual
12018: actions, and, consequently, in experience.--This is the only one of all
12019: the Ideas of pure Reason, whose object is a thing of fact, and to be
12020: reckoned under the _scibilia_.
12021: 
12022: (3.) Objects, which in reference to the use of pure practical Reason
12023: that is in conformity with duty must be thought _a priori_ (whether
12024: as consequences or as grounds), but which are transcendent for its
12025: theoretical use, are mere _things of faith_. Of this kind is the
12026: _highest good_ in the world, to be brought about by freedom.[148]
12027: The concept of this cannot be established as regards its objective
12028: reality in any experience possible for us and thus adequately for
12029: the theoretical use of Reason; but its use is commanded by practical
12030: pure Reason [in reference to the best possible working out of that
12031: purpose],[149] and it consequently must be assumed possible. This
12032: commanded effect, _together with the only conditions of its possibility
12033: thinkable by us_, viz. the Being of God and the immortality of the
12034: soul, are _things of faith_ (_res fidei_), and of all objects are the
12035: only ones which can be so called.[150] For though what we learn by
12036: _testimony_ from the experience of others must be believed by us, yet
12037: it is not therefore a thing of faith; for it was the proper experience
12038: of some _one_ witness and so a thing of fact, or is presupposed as
12039: such. Again it must be possible by this path (that of historical faith)
12040: to arrive at knowledge; and the Objects of history and geography,
12041: like everything in general which it is at least possible to know by
12042: the constitution of our cognitive faculties, belong not to things of
12043: faith but to things of fact. It is only objects of pure Reason which
12044: can be things of faith at all, though not as objects of the mere pure
12045: speculative Reason: for then they could not be reckoned with certainty
12046: among things, _i.e._ Objects of that cognition which is possible for
12047: us. They are Ideas, _i.e._ concepts of the objective reality of which
12048: we cannot theoretically be certain. On the other hand, the highest
12049: final purpose to be worked out by us, by which alone we can become
12050: worthy of being ourselves the final purpose of creation, is an Idea
12051: which has in a practical reference objective reality for us, and is
12052: also a thing. But because we cannot furnish such reality to this
12053: concept in a theoretical point of view, it is a mere thing of faith
12054: of the pure Reason, along with God and Immortality, as the conditions
12055: under which alone we, in accordance with the constitution of our
12056: (human) Reason, can conceive the possibility of that effect of the use
12057: of our freedom in conformity with law. But belief in things of faith is
12058: a belief in a pure practical point of view, _i.e._ a moral faith, which
12059: proves nothing for theoretical pure rational cognition, but only for
12060: that which is practical and directed to the fulfilment of its duties;
12061: it in no way extends speculation or the practical rules of prudence in
12062: accordance with the principle of self-love. If the supreme principle
12063: of all moral laws is a postulate, so is also the possibility of its
12064: highest Object; and consequently, too, the condition under which we
12065: can think this possibility is postulated along with it and by it.
12066: Thus the cognition of the latter is neither knowledge nor opinion of
12067: the being and character of these conditions, regarded as theoretical
12068: cognition; but is a mere assumption in a reference which is practical
12069: and commanded for the moral use of our Reason.
12070: 
12071: If we were able also plausibly to base upon the purposes of nature,
12072: which physical Teleology presents to us in such rich abundance, a
12073: _determinate_ concept of an intelligent World-Cause, then the existence
12074: [Dasein] of this Being would not be a thing of faith. For since this
12075: would not be assumed on behalf of the performance of my duty, but
12076: only in reference to the explanation of nature, it would be merely
12077: the opinion and hypothesis most conformable to our Reason. Now such
12078: Teleology leads in no way to a determinate concept of God; on the
12079: contrary, this can only be found in the concept of a moral Author of
12080: the World, because this alone furnishes the final purpose to which
12081: we can only reckon ourselves [as attached] if we behave conformably
12082: to what the moral law prescribes as final purpose and consequently
12083: obliges us [to do]. Hence it is only by its reference to the Object of
12084: our duty, as the condition of the possibility of attaining the final
12085: purpose of the same, that the concept of God attains the privilege
12086: of counting as a thing of faith, in our belief; but on the other
12087: hand, this same concept cannot make its Object valid as a thing of
12088: fact. For, although the necessity of duty is very plain for practical
12089: Reason, yet the attainment of its final purpose, so far as it is not
12090: altogether in our own power, is only assumed on behalf of the practical
12091: use of Reason, and therefore is not so practically necessary as duty
12092: itself.[151]
12093: 
12094: _Faith_ (as _habitus_, not as _actus_) is the moral attitude of Reason
12095: as to belief in that which is unattainable by theoretical cognition.
12096: It is therefore the constant principle of the mind, to assume as true,
12097: on account of the obligation in reference to it, that which it is
12098: necessary to presuppose as condition of the possibility of the highest
12099: moral final purpose[152]; although its possibility or impossibility
12100: be alike impossible for us to see into. Faith (absolutely so called)
12101: is trust in the attainment of a design, the promotion of which is a
12102: duty, but the possibility of the fulfilment of which (and consequently
12103: also that of the only conditions of it thinkable by us) is not to be
12104: _comprehended_ by us. Faith, then, that refers to particular objects,
12105: which are not objects of possible knowledge or opinion (in which latter
12106: case it ought to be called, especially in historical matters, credulity
12107: and not faith), is quite moral. It is a free belief, not in that for
12108: which dogmatical proofs for the theoretically determinant Judgement
12109: are to be found, or in that to which we hold ourselves bound, but in
12110: that which we assume on behalf of a design in accordance with laws of
12111: freedom. This, however, is not, like opinion, without any adequate
12112: ground; but, is grounded as in Reason (although only in respect of its
12113: practical employment), and _adequately for its design_. For without
12114: this, the moral attitude of thought in its repudiation of the claim of
12115: the theoretical Reason for proofs (of the possibility of the Objects
12116: of morality) has no permanence; but wavers between practical commands
12117: and theoretical doubts. To be _incredulous_ means to cling to maxims,
12118: and not to believe testimony in general; but he is _unbelieving_,
12119: who denies all validity to rational Ideas, because there is wanting
12120: a _theoretical_ ground of their reality.[154] He judges therefore
12121: dogmatically. A dogmatical _unbelief_ cannot subsist together with a
12122: moral maxim dominant in the mental attitude (for Reason cannot command
12123: one to follow a purpose, which is cognised as nothing more than a
12124: chimera); but a _doubtful faith_ can. To this the absence of conviction
12125: by grounds of speculative Reason is only a hindrance, the influence of
12126: which upon conduct a critical insight into the limits of this faculty
12127: can remove, while it substitutes by way of compensation a paramount
12128: practical belief.

12131:        *       *       *       *       *
12132: 
12133: If, in place of certain mistaken attempts, we wish to introduce a
12134: different principle into philosophy and to promote its influence, it
12135: makes us highly contented to see how and why those attempts must have
12136: disappointed us.
12137: 
12138: _God_, _freedom_, and _immortality_, are the problems at the solution
12139: of which all the equipments of Metaphysic aim, as their ultimate and
12140: unique purpose. Now it was believed that the doctrine of freedom is
12141: needed for practical philosophy only as its negative condition; but
12142: that on the other hand the doctrine of God and of the constitution of
12143: the soul, as belonging to theoretical philosophy, must be established
12144: for themselves and separately, in order afterwards to unite both
12145: with that which the moral law (possible only under the condition of
12146: freedom) commands, and so to constitute a religion. But we can easily
12147: see that these attempts must fail. For from mere ontological concepts
12148: of things in general, or of the existence of a necessary Being, it
12149: is possible to form absolutely no determinate concept of an original
12150: Being by means of predicates which can be given in experience and can
12151: therefore serve for cognition. Again a concept based on experience of
12152: the physical purposiveness of nature could furnish no adequate proof
12153: for morality, or consequently for cognition of a Deity. Just as little
12154: could the cognition of the soul by means of experience (which we only
12155: apply in this life) supply us with a concept of its spiritual immortal
12156: nature, a concept which would be adequate for morality. _Theology_ and
12157: _Pneumatology_, regarded as problems of the sciences of a speculative
12158: Reason, can be established by no empirical data and predicates,
12159: because the concept of them is transcendent for our whole cognitive
12160: faculty.--The determination of both concepts, God and the soul (in
12161: respect of its immortality) alike, can only take place by means of
12162: predicates, which, although they are only possible from a supersensible
12163: ground, must yet prove their reality in experience; for thus alone can
12164: they make possible a cognition of a quite supersensible Being.--The
12165: only concept of this kind to be met with in human Reason is that of the
12166: freedom of men under moral laws, along with the final purpose which
12167: Reason prescribes by these laws. Of these two [the moral laws and the
12168: final purpose] the first are useful for ascribing to the Author of
12169: Nature, the second for ascribing to man, those properties which contain
12170: the necessary condition of the possibility of both [God and the soul];
12171: so that from this Idea a conclusion can be drawn as to the existence
12172: and constitution of these beings which are otherwise quite hidden from
12173: us.
12174: 
12175: Thus the ground of the failure of the attempt to prove God and
12176: immortality by the merely theoretical path lies in this, that no
12177: cognition whatever is possible of the supersensible in this way (of
12178: natural concepts). The ground of its success by the moral way (of the
12179: concept of freedom) is as follows. Here the supersensible (freedom),
12180: which in this case is fundamental, by a determinate law of causality
12181: that springs from it, not only supplies material for cognition of other
12182: supersensibles (the moral final purpose and the conditions of its
12183: attainability), but also establishes its reality in actions as a fact;
12184: though at the same time it can furnish a valid ground of proof in no
12185: other than a practical point of view (the only one, however, of which
12186: Religion has need).
12187: 
12188: It is thus very remarkable that of the three pure rational Ideas,
12189: _God_, _freedom_, and _immortality_, that of freedom is the only
12190: concept of the supersensible which (by means of the causality that is
12191: thought in it) proves its objective reality in nature by means of the
12192: effects it can produce there; and thus renders possible the connexion
12193: of both the others with nature, and of all three together with
12194: Religion. We have therefore in us a principle capable of determining
12195: the Idea of the supersensible within us, and thus also that of the
12196: supersensible without us, for knowledge, although only in a practical
12197: point of view; a principle this of which mere speculative philosophy
12198: (which could give a merely negative concept of freedom) must despair.
12199: Consequently the concept of freedom (as fundamental concept of all
12200: unconditioned practical laws) can extend Reason beyond those bounds,
12201: within which every natural (theoretical) concept must remain hopelessly
12202: limited.
12203: 
12204: 
12205: _General remark on Teleology_
12206: 
12207: If the question is, what rank the moral argument, which proves the
12208: Being of God only as a thing of faith for the practical pure Reason,
12209: maintains among the other arguments in philosophy, it is easy to set
12210: aside the whole achievement of this last; by which it appears that
12211: there is no choice, but that our theoretical faculty must give up all
12212: its pretensions before an impartial criticism.
12213: 
12214: All belief must in the first place be grounded upon facts, if it is
12215: not to be completely groundless; and therefore the only distinction
12216: in proofs that there can be is that belief in the consequence derived
12217: therefrom can either be grounded on this fact as _knowledge_ for
12218: theoretical cognition, or merely as _faith_ for practical. All facts
12219: belong either to the _natural concept_ which proves its reality in the
12220: objects of sense, given (or which may possibly be given) before all
12221: natural concepts; or to the _concept of freedom_, which sufficiently
12222: establishes its reality through the causality of Reason in regard of
12223: certain effects in the world of sense, possible through it, which it
12224: incontrovertibly postulates in the moral law. The natural concept
12225: (merely belonging to theoretical cognition) is now either metaphysical
12226: and thinkable completely _a priori_, or physical, _i.e._ thinkable
12227: _a posteriori_ and as necessary only through determinate experience.
12228: The metaphysical natural concept (which presupposes no determinate
12229: experience) is therefore ontological.
12230: 
12231: The _ontological_ proof of the being of God from the concept of an
12232: original Being is either that which from ontological predicates,
12233: by which alone it can be thought as completely determined, infers
12234: absolutely necessary being; or that which, from the absolute necessity
12235: of the being somewhere of some thing, whatever it be, infers the
12236: predicates of the original Being. For there belongs to the concept of
12237: an original Being, inasmuch as it is not derived from anything, the
12238: unconditioned necessity of its presence, and (in order to represent
12239: this) its complete determination by its [mere][155] concept. It was
12240: believed that both requirements were found in the concept of the
12241: ontological Idea of a _Being the most real of all_; and thus two
12242: metaphysical proofs originated.
12243: 
12244: The proof (properly called ontological) resting upon a merely
12245: metaphysical natural concept concludes from the concept of the
12246: Being the most real of all, its absolutely necessary existence;
12247: for (it is said), if it did not exist, a reality would be wanting
12248: to it, viz. existence.--The other (which is also called the
12249: metaphysico-_cosmological_ proof) concludes from the necessity of the
12250: existence somewhere of a thing (which must be conceded, for a being
12251: is given to us in self-consciousness), its complete determination as
12252: that of a Being the most real of all; for everything existing must be
12253: completely determined, but the absolutely necessary (_i.e._ that which
12254: _we_ ought to cognise as such and consequently _a priori_) must be
12255: completely determined _by means of its own concept_. But this is only
12256: the case with the concept of a thing the most real of all. It is not
12257: needful to expose here the sophistry in both arguments, which has been
12258: already done elsewhere;[156] it is only needful to remark that neither
12259: proof, even if they could be defended by all manner of dialectical
12260: subtlety, could ever pass from the schools into the world, or have the
12261: slightest influence on the mere sound Understanding.
12262: 
12263: The proof, which rests on a natural concept that can only be empirical
12264: and yet is to lead us beyond the bounds of nature regarded as the
12265: complex of the objects of sense, can be no other than that derived from
12266: the _purposes_ of nature. The concept of these cannot, it is true,
12267: be given _a priori_ but only through experience; but yet it promises
12268: such a concept of the original ground of nature as alone, among all
12269: those which we can conceive, is suited to the supersensible, viz. that
12270: of a highest Understanding as Cause of the world. This, in fact, it
12271: completely performs in accordance with principles of the reflective
12272: Judgement, _i.e._ in accordance with the constitution of our (human)
12273: faculty of cognition.--But whether or not it is in a position to supply
12274: from the same data this concept of a _supreme_, _i.e._ independent
12275: intelligent Being, in short of a God or Author of a world under moral
12276: laws, and consequently as sufficiently determined for the Idea of a
12277: final purpose of the being of the world--this is the question upon
12278: which everything depends, whether we desire a theoretically adequate
12279: concept of the Original Being on behalf of our whole knowledge of
12280: nature, or a practical concept for religion.
12281: 
12282: This argument derived from physical Teleology is worthy of respect. It
12283: produces a similar effect in the way of conviction upon the common
12284: Understanding as upon the subtlest thinker; and a _Reimarus_[157] has
12285: acquired immortal honour in his work (not yet superseded), in which he
12286: abundantly develops this ground of proof with his peculiar thoroughness
12287: and lucidity.--But how does this proof acquire such mighty influence
12288: upon the mind? How does a judgement by cold reason (for we might
12289: refer to persuasion the emotion and elevation of reason produced by
12290: the wonders of nature) issue thus in a calm and unreserved assent? It
12291: is not the physical purposes, which all indicate in the World Cause
12292: an unfathomable intelligence; these are inadequate thereto, because
12293: they do not satisfy the need of the inquiring Reason. For, wherefore
12294: (it asks) are all those natural things that exhibit art? Wherefore is
12295: man himself, whom we must regard as the ultimate purpose of nature
12296: thinkable by us? Wherefore is this collective Nature here, and what
12297: is the final purpose of such great and manifold art? Reason cannot
12298: be contented with enjoyment or with contemplation, observation, and
12299: admiration (which, if it stops there, is only enjoyment of a particular
12300: kind) as the ultimate final purpose for the creation of the world and
12301: of man himself; for this presupposes a personal worth, which man alone
12302: can give himself, as the condition under which alone he and his being
12303: can be the final purpose. Failing this (which alone is susceptible
12304: of a definite concept), the purposes of nature do not satisfactorily
12305: answer our questions; especially because they cannot furnish any
12306: _determinate_ concept of the highest Being as an all-sufficient (and
12307: therefore unique and so properly called _highest_) being, and of the
12308: laws according to which an Understanding is Cause of the world.
12309: 
12310: Hence that the physico-teleological proof convinces, just as if it were
12311: a theological proof, does not arise from our availing ourselves of the
12312: Ideas of purposes of nature as so many empirical grounds of proof of
12313: a _highest_ Understanding. But it mingles itself unnoticed with that
12314: moral ground of proof, which dwells in every man and influences him
12315: secretly, in the conclusion by which we ascribe to the Being, which
12316: manifests itself with such incomprehensible art in the purposes of
12317: nature, a final purpose and consequently wisdom (without however being
12318: justified in doing so by the perception of the former); and by which
12319: therefore we arbitrarily fill up the lacunas of the [design] argument.
12320: In fact it is only the moral ground of proof which produces conviction,
12321: and that only in a moral reference with which every man feels inwardly
12322: his agreement. But the physico-teleological proof has only the merit
12323: of leading the mind, in its consideration of the world, by the way of
12324: purposes and through them to an _intelligent_ Author of the world. The
12325: moral reference to purposes and the Idea of a moral legislator and
12326: Author of the world, as a theological concept, seem to be developed of
12327: themselves out of that ground of proof, although they are in truth pure
12328: additions.
12329: 
12330: Henceforward we may allow the customary statement to stand. For it
12331: is generally difficult (if the distinction requires much reflection)
12332: for ordinary sound Understanding to distinguish from one another as
12333: heterogeneous the different principles which it confuses, and from
12334: one of which alone it actually draws conclusions with correctness. The
12335: moral ground of proof of the Being of God, properly speaking, does
12336: not merely _complete_ and render perfect the physico-teleological
12337: proof; but it is a special proof that _supplies_ the conviction which
12338: is wanting in the latter. This latter in fact can do nothing more
12339: than guide Reason, in its judgements upon the ground of nature and
12340: that contingent but admirable order of nature only known to us by
12341: experience, to the causality of a Cause containing the ground of the
12342: same in accordance with purposes (which we by the constitution of our
12343: cognitive faculties must think as an intelligent cause); and thus by
12344: arresting the attention of Reason it makes it more susceptible of
12345: the moral proof. For what is requisite to the latter concept is so
12346: essentially different from everything which natural concepts contain
12347: and can teach, that there is need of a particular ground of proof
12348: quite independent of the former, in order to supply the concept of the
12349: original Being adequately for Theology and to infer its existence.--The
12350: moral proof (which it is true only proves the Being of God in a
12351: practical though indispensable aspect of Reason) would preserve all
12352: its force, if we found in the world no material, or only that which
12353: is doubtful, for physical Teleology. It is possible to conceive
12354: rational beings surrounded by a nature which displayed no clear trace
12355: of organisation but only the effects of a mere mechanism of crude
12356: matter; on behalf of which and amid the changeability of some merely
12357: contingent purposive forms and relations there would appear to be no
12358: ground for inferring an intelligent Author. In such case there would
12359: be no occasion for a physical Teleology; and yet Reason, which here
12360: gets no guidance from natural concepts, would find in the concept of
12361: freedom and in the moral Ideas founded thereon a practically sufficient
12362: ground for postulating the concept of the original Being in conformity
12363: with these, _i.e._ as a Deity, and for postulating nature (even the
12364: nature of our own being) as a final purpose in accordance with freedom
12365: and its laws--and all this in reference to the indispensable command of
12366: practical Reason.--However the fact that there is in the actual world
12367: for the rational beings in it abundant material for physical Teleology
12368: (even though this is not necessary) serves as a desirable confirmation
12369: of the moral argument, as far as nature can exhibit anything analogous
12370: to the (moral) rational Ideas. For the concept of a supreme Cause
12371: possessing intelligence (though not reaching far enough for a Theology)
12372: thus acquires sufficient reality for the reflective Judgement, but it
12373: is not required as the basis of the moral proof; nor does this latter
12374: serve to complete as a proof the former, which does not by itself point
12375: to morality at all, by means of an argument developed according to
12376: a single principle. Two such heterogeneous principles as nature and
12377: freedom can only furnish two different kinds of proof; and the attempt
12378: to derive one from the other is found unavailing as regards that which
12379: is to be proved.
12380: 
12381: If the physico-teleological ground of proof sufficed for the proof
12382: which is sought, it would be very satisfactory for the speculative
12383: Reason; for it would furnish the hope of founding a Theosophy (for
12384: so we must call the theoretical cognition of the divine nature and
12385: its existence which would suffice at once for the explanation of the
12386: constitution of the world and for the determination of moral laws).
12387: In the same way if Psychology enabled us to arrive at a cognition
12388: of the immortality of the soul it would make Pneumatology possible,
12389: which would be just as welcome to the speculative Reason. But neither,
12390: agreeable as they would be to the arrogance of our curiosity, would
12391: satisfy the wish of Reason in respect of a theory which must be based
12392: on a cognition of the nature of things. Whether the first, as Theology,
12393: and the second, as Anthropology, when founded on the moral principle,
12394: _i.e._ the principle of freedom, and consequently in accordance with
12395: the practical use [of Reason] do not better fulfil their objective
12396: final design, is another question which we need not here pursue.
12397: 
12398: The physico-teleological ground of proof does not reach to Theology,
12399: because it does not and cannot give any determinate concept, sufficient
12400: for this design, of the original Being; but we must derive this from
12401: quite another quarter, or must supply its lacuna by an arbitrary
12402: addition. You infer, from the great purposiveness of natural forms and
12403: their relations, a world-cause endowed with Understanding; but what is
12404: the degree of this Understanding? Without doubt you cannot assume that
12405: it is the highest possible Understanding; because for that it would be
12406: requisite that you should see that a greater Understanding than that
12407: of which you perceive proofs in the world, is not thinkable; and this
12408: would be to ascribe Omniscience to yourself.[158] In the same way,
12409: if you infer from the magnitude of the world the very great might of
12410: its Author, you must be content with this having only a comparative
12411: significance for your faculty of comprehension; for since you do not
12412: know all that is possible, so as to compare it with the magnitude of
12413: the world as far as you know it, you cannot infer the Almightiness
12414: of its Author from so small a standard, and so on. Now you arrive in
12415: this way at no definite concept of an original Being available for a
12416: Theology; for this can only be found in the concept of the totality of
12417: perfections compatible with intelligence, and you cannot help yourself
12418: to this by merely _empirical_ data. But without such a definite concept
12419: you cannot infer a _unique_ intelligent original Being; you can only
12420: assume it (with whatever motive).--Now it may certainly be conceded
12421: that you should arbitrarily add (for Reason has nothing fundamental to
12422: say to the contrary): Where so much perfection is found, we may well
12423: assume that all perfection is united in a unique Cause of the world,
12424: because Reason succeeds better both theoretically and practically with
12425: a principle thus definite. But then you cannot regard this concept
12426: of the original Being as proved by you, for you have only assumed it
12427: on behalf of a better employment of Reason. Hence all lamentation or
12428: impotent anger on account of the alleged mischief of rendering doubtful
12429: the coherency of your chain of reasoning, is vain pretentiousness,
12430: which would fain have us believe that the doubt here freely expressed
12431: as to your argument is a doubting of sacred truth, in order that under
12432: this cover the shallowness of your argument may pass unnoticed.
12433: 
12434: Moral Teleology, on the other hand, which is not less firmly based
12435: than physical,--which, indeed, rather deserves the preference because
12436: it rests _a priori_ on principles inseparable from our Reason--leads
12437: to that which is requisite for the possibility of a Theology, viz. to
12438: a determinate _concept_ of the supreme Cause, as Cause of the world
12439: according to moral laws, and, consequently, to the concept of such a
12440: cause as satisfies our moral final purpose. For this are required, as
12441: natural properties belonging to it, nothing less than Omniscience,
12442: Omnipotence, Omnipresence, and the like, which must be thought as
12443: bound up with the moral final purpose which is infinite and thus as
12444: adequate to it. Hence moral Teleology alone can furnish the concept of
12445: a _unique_ Author of the world, which is available for a Theology.
12446: 
12447: In this way Theology leads immediately to _Religion_, _i.e._ _the
12448: recognition of our duties as divine commands_[159]; because it is only
12449: the recognition of our duty and of the final purpose enjoined upon us
12450: by Reason which brings out with definiteness the concept of God. This
12451: concept, therefore, is inseparable in its origin from obligation to
12452: that Being. On the other hand, even if the concept of the original
12453: Being could be also found determinately by the merely theoretical path
12454: (viz. the concept of it as mere Cause of nature), it would afterwards
12455: be very difficult--perhaps impossible without arbitrary interpolation
12456: [of elements]--to ascribe to this Being by well-grounded proofs a
12457: causality in accordance with moral laws; and yet without this that
12458: quasi-theological concept could furnish no foundation for religion.
12459: Even if a religion could be established by this theoretical path, it
12460: would actually, as regards sentiment (wherein its essence lies) be
12461: different from that in which the concept of God and the (practical)
12462: conviction of His Being originate from the fundamental Ideas of
12463: morality. For if we must suppose the Omnipotence, Omniscience, etc., of
12464: an Author of the world as concepts given to us from another quarter,
12465: in order afterwards only to apply our concepts of duties to our
12466: relation to Him, then these latter concepts must bear very markedly
12467: the appearance of compulsion and forced submission. If, instead of
12468: this, the respect for the moral law, quite freely, in virtue of the
12469: precept of our own Reason, represents to us the final purpose of our
12470: destination, we admit among our moral views a Cause harmonising with
12471: this and with its accomplishment, with the sincerest reverence, which
12472: is quite distinct from pathological fear; and we willingly submit
12473: ourselves thereto.[160]
12474: 
12475: If it be asked why it is incumbent upon us to have any Theology at all,
12476: it appears clear that it is not needed for the extension or correction
12477: of our cognition of nature or in general for any theory, but simply
12478: in a subjective point of view for Religion, _i.e._ the practical or
12479: moral use of our Reason. If it is found that the only argument which
12480: leads to a definite concept of the object of Theology is itself moral,
12481: it is not only not strange, but we miss nothing in respect of its
12482: final purpose as regards the sufficiency of belief from this ground
12483: of proof, provided that it be admitted that such an argument only
12484: establishes the Being of God sufficiently for our moral destination,
12485: _i.e._ in a practical point of view, and that here speculation neither
12486: shows its strength in any way, nor extends by means of it the sphere
12487: of its domain. Our surprise and the alleged contradiction between the
12488: possibility of a Theology asserted here and that which the Critique
12489: of speculative Reason said of the Categories--viz. that they can only
12490: produce knowledge when applied to objects of sense, but in no way when
12491: applied to the supersensible--vanish, if we see that they are here
12492: used for a cognition of God not in a theoretical point of view (in
12493: accordance with what His own nature, inscrutable to us, may be) but
12494: simply in a practical.--In order then at this opportunity to make an
12495: end of the misinterpretation of that very necessary doctrine of the
12496: Critique, which, to the chagrin of the blind dogmatist, refers Reason
12497: to its bounds, I add here the following elucidation.
12498: 
12499: If I ascribe to a body _motive force_ and thus think it by means of
12500: the category of _causality_, then I at the same time _cognise_ it
12501: by that [category]; _i.e._ I determine the concept of it, as of an
12502: Object in general, by means of what belongs to it by itself (as the
12503: condition of the possibility of that relation) as an object of sense.
12504: If the motive force ascribed to it is repulsive, then there belongs to
12505: it (although I do not place near it any other body upon which it may
12506: exert force) a place in space, and moreover extension, _i.e._ space
12507: in itself, besides the filling up of this by means of the repulsive
12508: forces of its parts. In addition there is the law of this filling up
12509: (that the ground of the repulsion of the parts must decrease in the
12510: same proportion as the extension of the body increases, and as the
12511: space, which it fills with the same parts by means of this force, is
12512: augmented).--On the contrary, if I think a supersensible Being as the
12513: first _mover_, and thus by the category of causality as regards its
12514: determination of the world (motion of matter), I must not think it as
12515: existing in any place in space nor as extended; I must not even think
12516: it as existing in time or simultaneously with other beings. Hence I
12517: have no determinations whatever, which could make intelligible to me
12518: the condition of the possibility of motion by means of this Being as
12519: its ground. Consequently, I do not in the very least cognise it by
12520: means of the predicate of Cause (as first mover), for itself; but I
12521: have only the representation of a something containing the ground
12522: of the motions in the world; and the relation of the latter to it
12523: as their cause, since it does not besides furnish me with anything
12524: belonging to the constitution of the thing which is cause, leaves its
12525: concept quite empty. The reason of this is, that by predicates which
12526: only find their Object in the world of sense I can indeed proceed
12527: to the being of something which must contain their ground, but not
12528: to the determination of its concept as a supersensible being, which
12529: excludes all these predicates. By the category of causality, then,
12530: if I determine it by the concept of a _first mover_, I do not in the
12531: very least cognise what God is. Perhaps, however, I shall have better
12532: success if I start from the order of the world, not merely to _think_
12533: its causality as that of a supreme _Understanding_, but to _cognise_
12534: it by means of this determination of the said concept; because here
12535: the troublesome condition of space and of extension disappears.--At
12536: all events the great purposiveness in the world compels us to _think_
12537: a supreme cause of it, and to _think_ its causality as that of an
12538: Understanding; but we are not therefore entitled to _ascribe_ this to
12539: it. (_E.g._ we think of the eternity of God as presence in all time,
12540: because we can form no other concept of mere being as a quantum, _i.e._
12541: as duration; or we think of the divine Omnipresence as presence in
12542: all places in order to make comprehensible to ourselves His immediate
12543: presence in things which are external to one another; without daring
12544: to ascribe to God any of these determinations, as something cognised
12545: in Him.) If I determine the causality of a man, in respect of certain
12546: products which are only explicable by designed purposiveness, by
12547: thinking it as that of Understanding, I need not stop here, but I can
12548: ascribe to him this predicate as a well-known property and cognise him
12549: accordingly. For I know that intuitions are given to the senses of men
12550: and are brought by the Understanding under a concept and thus under a
12551: rule; that this concept only contains the common characteristic (with
12552: omission of the particular ones) and is thus discursive; and that the
12553: rules for bringing given representations under a consciousness in
12554: general are given by Understanding before those intuitions, etc. I
12555: therefore ascribe this property to man as a property by means of which
12556: I _cognise_ him. However, if I wish to _think_ a supersensible Being
12557: (God) as an intelligence, this is not only permissible in a certain
12558: aspect of my employment of Reason--it is unavoidable; but to ascribe
12559: to Him Understanding and to flatter ourselves that we can _cognise_
12560: Him by means of it as a property of His, is in no way permissible.
12561: For I must omit all those conditions under which alone I know an
12562: Understanding, and thus the predicate which only serves for determining
12563: man cannot be applied at all to a supersensible Object; and therefore
12564: by a causality thus determined, I cannot cognise what God is. And so it
12565: is with all Categories, which can have no significance for cognition in
12566: a theoretical aspect, if they are not applied to objects of possible
12567: experience.--However, according to the analogy of an Understanding I
12568: can in a certain other aspect think a supersensible being, without at
12569: the same time meaning thereby to cognise it theoretically; viz. if this
12570: determination of its causality concerns an effect in the world, which
12571: contains a design morally necessary but unattainable by a sensible
12572: being. For then a cognition of God and of His Being (Theology) is
12573: possible by means of properties and determinations of His causality
12574: merely thought in Him according to analogy, which has all requisite
12575: reality in a practical reference though _only in respect of this_
12576: (as moral).--An Ethical Theology is therefore possible; for though
12577: morality can subsist without theology as regards its rule, it cannot
12578: do so as regards the final design which this proposes, unless Reason
12579: in respect of it is to be renounced. But a Theological Ethic (of pure
12580: Reason) is impossible; for laws which Reason itself does not give and
12581: whose observance it does not bring about as a pure practical faculty,
12582: can not be moral. In the same way a Theological Physic would be a
12583: nonentity, for it would propose no laws of nature but ordinances of a
12584: Highest Will; while on the other hand a physical (properly speaking a
12585: physico-teleological) Theology can serve at least as a propaedeutic
12586: to Theology proper, by giving occasion for the Idea of a final purpose
12587: which nature cannot present by the observation of natural purposes of
12588: which it offers abundant material. It thus makes felt the need of a
12589: Theology which shall determine the concept of God adequately for the
12590: highest practical use of Reason, but it cannot develop this and base it
12591: satisfactorily on its proofs.

12744: 
12745: [8] [Reading, with Windelband, _in sicheren alleinigen Besitz_.]
12746: 
12747: [9] If we have cause for supposing that concepts which we use as
12748: empirical principles stand in relationship with the pure cognitive
12749: faculty _a priori_, it is profitable, because of this reference,
12750: to seek for them a transcendental definition; _i.e._ a definition
12751: through pure categories, so far as these by themselves adequately
12752: furnish the distinction of the concept in question from others. We
12753: here follow the example of the mathematician who leaves undetermined
12754: the empirical data of his problem, and only brings their relation in
12755: their pure synthesis under the concepts of pure Arithmetic, and thus
12756: generalises the solution. Objection has been brought against a similar
12757: procedure of mine (cf. the Preface to the Critique of Practical Reason,
12758: _Abbott’s Translation_, p. 94), and my definition of the faculty
12759: of desire has been found fault with, viz. that it is [the being’s]
12760: _faculty of becoming by means of its representations the cause of the
12761: actuality of the objects of these representations_; for the desires
12762: might be mere _cravings_, and by means of these alone every one is
12763: convinced the Object cannot be produced.--But this proves nothing more
12764: than that there are desires in man, by which he is in contradiction
12765: with himself. For here he strives for the production of the Object
12766: by means of the representation _alone_, from which he can expect no
12767: result, because he is conscious that his mechanical powers (if I may
12768: so call those which are not psychological) which must be determined
12769: by that representation to bring about the Object (mediately) are
12770: either not competent, or even tend towards what is impossible; e.g.
12771: to reverse the past (_O mihi praeteritos_ ... etc.), or to annihilate
12772: in the impatience of expectation the interval before the wished for
12773: moment.--Although in such fantastic desires we are conscious of the
12774: inadequacy (or even the unsuitability) of our representations for
12775: being _causes_ of their objects, yet their reference as causes, and
12776: consequently the representation of their _causality_, is contained in
12777: every _wish_; and this is specially evident if the wish is an affection
12778: or _longing_. For these [longings] by their dilatation and contraction
12779: of the heart and consequent exhaustion of its powers, prove that these
12780: powers are continually kept on the stretch by representations, but that
12781: they perpetually let the mind, having regard to the impossibility [of
12782: the desire], fall back in exhaustion. Even prayers for the aversion
12783: of great and (as far as one can see) unavoidable evils, and many
12784: superstitious means for attaining in a natural way impossible purposes,
12785: point to the causal reference of representations to their Objects; a
12786: reference which cannot at all be checked by the consciousness of the
12787: inadequacy of the effort to produce the effect.--As to why there should
12788: be in our nature this propensity to desires which are consciously vain,
12789: that is an anthropologico-teleological problem. It seems that if we
12790: were not determined to the application of our powers before we were
12791: assured of the adequacy of our faculties to produce an Object, these
12792: powers would remain in great part unused. For we commonly learn to
12793: know our powers only by first making trial of them. This deception in
12794: the case of vain wishes is then only the consequence of a benevolent
12795: ordinance in our nature. [This note was added by Kant in the Second
12796: Edition.]
12797: 
12798: [10] One of the various pretended contradictions in this whole
12799: distinction of the causality of nature from that of freedom is
12800: this. It is objected that if I speak of _obstacles_ which nature
12801: opposes to causality according to (moral) laws of freedom or of the
12802: _assistance_ it affords, I am admitting an _influence_ of the former
12803: upon the latter. But if we try to understand what has been said, this
12804: misinterpretation is very easy to avoid. The opposition or assistance
12805: is not between nature and freedom, but between the former as phenomenon
12806: and the _effects_ of the latter as phenomena in the world of sense.
12807: The causality of freedom itself (of pure and practical Reason) is
12808: the causality of a natural cause subordinated to freedom (_i.e._
12809: of the subject considered as man and therefore as phenomenon). The
12810: intelligible, which is thought under freedom, contains the ground of
12811: the _determination_ of this [natural cause] in a way not explicable
12812: any further (just as that intelligible does which constitutes the
12813: supersensible substrate of nature).
12814: 
12815: [11] It has been thought a doubtful point that my divisions in pure
12816: Philosophy should always be threefold. But that lies in the nature of
12817: the thing. If there is to be an _a priori_ division it must be either
12818: _analytical_, according to the law of contradiction, which is always
12819: twofold (_quodlibet ens est aut A aut non A_); or it is _synthetical_.
12820: And if in this latter case it is to be derived from _a priori concepts_
12821: (not as in Mathematic from the intuition corresponding to the concept),
12822: the division must necessarily be trichotomy. For according to what
12823: is requisite for synthetical unity in general there must be (1) a
12824: condition, (2) a conditioned, and (3) the concept which arises from the
12825: union of the conditioned with its condition.
12826: 
12827: [12] The definition of taste which is laid down here is that it is the
12828: faculty of judging of the beautiful. But the analysis of judgements of
12829: taste must show what is required in order to call an object beautiful.
12830: The moments, to which this Judgement has regard in its reflection, I
12831: have sought in accordance with the guidance of the logical functions of
12832: judgement (for in a judgement of taste a reference to the Understanding
12833: is always involved). I have considered the moment of quality first,
12834: because the aesthetical judgement upon the beautiful first pays
12835: attention to it.
12836: 
12837: [13] A judgement upon an object of satisfaction may be quite
12838: _disinterested_, but yet very _interesting_, _i.e._ not based upon an
12839: interest, but bringing an interest with it; of this kind are all pure
12840: moral judgements. Judgements of taste, however, do not in themselves
12841: establish any interest. Only in society is it _interesting_ to have
12842: taste: the reason of this will be shown in the sequel.
12843: 
12844: [14] [Second Edition.]
12845: 
12846: [15] An obligation to enjoyment is a manifest absurdity. Thus the
12847: obligation to all actions which have merely enjoyment for their aim can
12848: only be a pretended one; however spiritually it may be conceived (or
12849: decked out), even if it is a mystical, or so-called heavenly, enjoyment.

12854: 
12855: [18] [Ueberweg points out (_Hist. of Phil._, ii. 528, Eng. Trans.)
12856: that Mendelssohn had already called attention to the disinterestedness
12857: of our satisfaction in the Beautiful. “It appears,” says Mendelssohn,
12858: “to be a particular mark of the beautiful, that it is contemplated
12859: with quiet satisfaction, that it pleases, even though it be not in our
12860: possession, and even though we be never so far removed from the desire
12861: to put it to our use.” But, of course, as Ueberweg remarks, Kant’s
12862: conception of disinterestedness extends far beyond the absence of a
12863: desire to possess the object.]

12886: pleasure which is not necessarily bound up with the desire of the
12887: object, and which, therefore, is at bottom not a pleasure in the
12888: existence of the Object of the representation, but clings to the

12905: first writer to give the name of Aesthetics to the Philosophy of Taste.
12906: He defined beauty as “perfection apprehended through the senses.” Kant

12908: pupil of Baumgarten’s, on this subject.]

12911: word _perfection_ is liable to many misconceptions. It is sometimes
12912: understood as a concept belonging to Transcendental Philosophy; viz.
12913: the concept of the _totality_ of the manifold, which, taken together,
12914: constitutes a Thing; sometimes, again, it is understood as belonging to
12915: _Teleology_, so that it signifies the agreement of the characteristics
12916: of a thing with a _purpose_. Perfection in the former sense might be
12917: called _quantitative_ (material), in the latter _qualitative_ (formal)

12924: [34] Models of taste as regards the arts of speech must be composed
12925: in a dead and learned language. The first, in order that they may not
12926: suffer that change which inevitably comes over living languages, in
12927: which noble expressions become flat, common ones antiquated, and newly
12928: created ones have only a short currency. The second, because learned
12929: languages have a grammar which is subject to no wanton change of
12930: fashion, but the rules of which are preserved unchanged.

12932: [35] [This distinction between an _Idea_ and an _Ideal_, as also
12933: the further contrast between Ideals of the Reason and Ideals of the

12937: [36] [Polycletus of Argos flourished about 430 B.C. His statue of the
12938: _Spearbearer_ (_Doryphorus_), afterwards became known as the _Canon_;

12940: representation of the ideal of the human figure.]

12945: 
12946: [38] It will be found that a perfectly regular countenance, such
12947: as a painter might wish to have for a model, ordinarily tells us
12948: nothing; because it contains nothing characteristic, and therefore
12949: rather expresses the Idea of the race than the specific [traits] of
12950: a person. The exaggeration of a characteristic of this kind, _i.e._
12951: such as does violence to the normal Idea (the purposiveness of the
12952: race) is called _caricature_. Experience also shows that these quite
12953: regular countenances commonly indicate internally only a mediocre man;
12954: presumably (if it may be assumed that external nature expresses the
12955: proportions of internal) because, if no mental disposition exceeds that
12956: proportion which is requisite in order to constitute a man free from
12957: faults, nothing can be expected of what is called _genius_, in which
12958: nature seems to depart from the ordinary relations of the mental powers
12959: on behalf of some special one.
12960: 
12961: [39] It might be objected to this explanation that there are things, in
12962: which we see a purposive form without cognising any [definite] purpose
12963: in them, like the stone implements often got from old sepulchral
12964: tumuli with a hole in them as if for a handle. These, although they
12965: plainly indicate by their shape a purposiveness of which we do not
12966: know the purpose, are nevertheless not described as beautiful. But if
12967: we regard a thing as a work of art, that is enough to make us admit
12968: that its shape has reference to some design and definite purpose. And
12969: hence there is no immediate satisfaction in the contemplation of it.
12970: On the other hand a flower, _e.g._ a tulip, is regarded as beautiful;
12971: because in perceiving it we find a certain purposiveness which, in our
12972: judgement, is referred to no purpose at all.

13090: [71] In order to be justified in claiming universal assent for an

13095: must be true, because otherwise men would not be able to communicate

13097: merely have reference to this relation (consequently to the _formal

13205: Imagination in contemplation, it so far agrees with mere aesthetical
13206: painting which has no definite theme (which arranges sky, land, and
13207: water, so as to entertain us by means of light and shade only).--In
13208: general the reader is only to judge of this as an attempt to combine
13209: the beautiful arts under one principle, viz. that of the expression

13213: [92] I must admit that a beautiful poem has always given me a pure
13214: gratification; whilst the reading of the best discourse, whether of a
13215: Roman orator or of a modern parliamentary speaker or of a preacher, has
13216: always been mingled with an unpleasant feeling of disapprobation of
13217: a treacherous art, which means to move men in important matters like
13218: machines to a judgement that must lose all weight for them on quiet
13219: reflection. Readiness and accuracy in speaking (which taken together
13220: constitute Rhetoric) belong to beautiful art; but the art of the orator
13221: (_ars oratoria_), the art of availing oneself of the weaknesses of men
13222: for one’s own designs (whether these be well meant or even actually
13223: good does not matter) is worthy of no _respect_. Again, this art only
13224: reached its highest point, both at Athens and at Rome, at a time when
13225: the state was hastening to its ruin and true patriotic sentiment had
13226: disappeared. The man who along with a clear insight into things has in
13227: his power a wealth of pure speech, and who with a fruitful Imagination
13228: capable of presenting his Ideas unites a lively sympathy with what is
13229: truly good, is the _vir bonus discendi peritus_, the orator without

13306: to the so-called immediate natural purposes. In a recent complete
13307: transformation of a great people into a state the word _organisation_
13308: for the regulation of magistracies, etc., and even of the whole
13309: body politic, has often been fitly used. For in such a whole every
13310: member should surely be purpose as well as means, and, whilst all
13311: work together towards the possibility of the whole, each should be
13312: determined as regards place and function by means of the Idea of the

13319: [110] In the aesthetical part [§ 58, p. 247] it was said: _We
13320: view beautiful nature with favour_, whilst we have a quite free
13321: (disinterested) satisfaction in its form. For in this mere judgement of
13322: taste no consideration is given to the purpose for which these natural
13323: beauties exist; whether to excite pleasure in us, or as purposes
13324: without any reference to us at all. But in a teleological judgement we
13325: pay attention to this reference, and here we can _regard it as a favour
13326: of nature_ that it has been willing to minister to our culture by the
13327: exhibition of so many beautiful figures.
13328: 
13329: [111] The German word _vermessen_ is a good word and full of meaning.
13330: A judgement in which we forget to consider the extent of our powers
13331: (our Understanding) may sometimes sound very humble, and yet make great
13332: pretensions, and so be very presumptuous. Of this kind are most of
13333: those by which we pretend to extol the divine wisdom by ascribing to
13334: it designs in the works of creation and preservation which are really
13335: meant to do honour to the private wisdom of the reasoner.
13336: 
13337: [112] We thus see that in most speculative things of pure Reason, as
13338: regards dogmatic assertions, the philosophical schools have commonly
13339: tried all possible solutions of a given question. To explain the
13340: purposiveness of nature men have tried either _lifeless matter_ or
13341: a _lifeless God_, or again, _living matter_ or a _living God_. It
13342: only remains for us, if the need should arise, to abandon all these
13343: objective _assertions_ and to examine critically our judgement merely
13344: in reference to our cognitive faculties, in order to supply to their
13345: principle a validity which, if not dogmatic, shall at least be that of
13346: a maxim sufficient for the sure employment of Reason.

13374: [120] We may call a hypothesis of this kind a daring venture of reason,
13375: and there may be few even of the most acute naturalists through whose
13376: head it has not sometimes passed. For it is not absurd, like that
13377: _generatio aequivoca_ by which is understood the production of an
13378: organised being through the mechanics of crude unorganised matter.
13379: It would always remain _generatio univoca_ in the most universal
13380: sense of the word, for it only considers one organic being as derived
13381: from another organic being, although from one which is specifically
13382: different; _e.g._ certain water-animals transform themselves gradually
13383: into marsh-animals and from these, after some generations, into
13384: land-animals. _A priori_, in the judgement of Reason alone, there is no
13385: contradiction here. Only experience gives no example of it; according
13386: to experience all generation that we know is _generatio homonyma_.
13387: This is not merely _univoca_ in contrast to the generation out of
13388: unorganised material, but in the organisation the product is of like
13389: kind to that which produced it; and _generation heteronyma_, so far as
13390: our empirical knowledge of nature extends, is nowhere found.

13395: valid in the case of human contrivance, it is not legitimate to rise by
13396: a like argument to Supreme Intelligence. “In human nature there is a
13397: certain experienced coherence of designs and inclinations; so that when
13398: from any fact we have discovered one intention of any man, it may often
13399: be reasonable from experience to infer another, and draw a long chain
13400: of conclusions concerning his past or future conduct. But this method
13401: of reasoning can never have place with regard to a being so remote and
13402: incomprehensible, who bears much less analogy to any other being in the
13403: universe than the sun to a waxen taper, and who discovers himself only

13439: yet, as an ancient observed, it makes more bad men than it takes away.”]
13440: 
13441: [130] The value of life for us, if it is estimated by that _which we
13442: enjoy_ (by the natural purpose of the sum of all inclinations, _i.e._
13443: happiness), is easy to decide. It sinks below zero; for who would be
13444: willing to enter upon life anew under the same conditions? who would do
13445: so even according to a new, self-chosen plan (yet in conformity with
13446: the course of nature), if it were merely directed to enjoyment? We
13447: have shown above what value life has in virtue of what it contains in
13448: itself, when lived in accordance with the purpose that nature has along
13449: with us, and which consists in what we do (not merely what we enjoy),
13450: in which, however, we are always but means towards an undetermined
13451: final purpose. There remains then nothing but the value which we
13452: ourselves give our life, through what we can not only do, but do
13453: purposively in such independence of nature that the existence of nature
13454: itself can only be a purpose under this condition.
13455: 
13456: [131] It would be possible that the happiness of rational beings in
13457: the world should be a purpose of nature, and then also this would be
13458: its _ultimate_ purpose. At least we cannot see _a priori_ why nature
13459: should not be so ordered, because by means of its mechanism this
13460: effect would be certainly possible, at least so far as we see. But
13461: morality, with a causality according to purposes subordinated thereto,
13462: is absolutely impossible by means of natural causes; for the principle
13463: by which it determines to action is supersensible, and is therefore
13464: the only possible principle in the order of purposes that in respect
13465: of nature is absolutely unconditioned. Its subject consequently alone
13466: is qualified to be the _final purpose_ of creation to which the whole
13467: of nature is subordinated.--_Happiness_, on the contrary, as has been
13468: shown in the preceding paragraphs by the testimony of experience, is
13469: not even a _purpose of nature_ in respect of man in preference to
13470: other creatures; much less a _final purpose of creation_. Men may of
13471: course make it their ultimate subjective purpose. But if I ask, in
13472: reference to the final purpose of creation, why must men exist? then
13473: we are speaking of an objective supreme purpose, such as the highest
13474: Reason would require for creation. If we answer: These beings exist
13475: to afford objects for the benevolence of that Supreme Cause; then we
13476: contradict the condition to which the Reason of man subjects even his
13477: inmost wish for happiness (viz. the harmony with his own internal moral
13478: legislation). This proves that happiness can only be a conditioned
13479: purpose, and that it is only as a moral being that man can be the final
13480: purpose of creation; but that as concerns his state happiness is only
13481: connected with it as a consequence, according to the measure of his
13482: harmony with that purpose regarded as the purpose of his being.
13483: 
13484: [132] [Second Edition.]
13485: 
13486: [133] I say deliberately under moral laws. It is not man _in accordance
13487: with_ moral laws, _i.e._ a being who behaves himself in conformity
13488: with them, who is the final purpose of creation. For by using the
13489: latter expression we should be asserting more than we know; viz. that
13490: it is in the power of an Author of the world to cause man always to
13491: behave himself in accordance with moral laws. But this presupposes a
13492: concept of freedom and of nature (of which latter we can only think an
13493: external author), which would imply an insight into the supersensible
13494: substrate of nature and its identity with that which causality through
13495: freedom makes possible in the world. And this far surpasses the
13496: insight of our Reason. Only of _man under moral laws_ can we say,
13497: without transgressing the limits of our insight: his being constitutes
13498: the final purpose of the world. This harmonises completely with the
13499: judgement of human Reason reflecting morally upon the course of the
13500: world. We believe that we perceive in the case of the wicked the traces
13501: of a wise purposive reference, if we only see that the wanton criminal
13502: does not die before he has undergone the deserved punishment of his
13503: misdeeds. According to our concepts of free causality, our good or bad
13504: behaviour depends on ourselves; we regard it the highest wisdom in the
13505: government of the world to ordain for the first, opportunity, and for
13506: both, their consequence, in accordance with moral laws. In the latter
13507: properly consists the glory of God, which is hence not unsuitably
13508: described by theologians as the ultimate purpose of creation.-- It
13509: is further to be remarked that when we use the word creation, we
13510: understand nothing more than we have said here, viz. the cause of the
13511: _being_ of the world or of the things in it (substances). This is
13512: what the concept properly belonging to this word involves (_actuatio
13513: substantiae est creatio_); and consequently there is not implied in it
13514: the supposition of a freely working, and therefore intelligent, cause
13515: (whose being we first of all want to prove).
13516: 
13517: [134] [Note added in Second Edition.] This moral argument does not
13518: supply any _objectively-valid_ proof of the Being of God; it does
13519: not prove to the sceptic that there is a God, but proves that if he
13520: wishes to think in a way consonant with morality, he must admit the
13521: _assumption_ of this proposition under the maxims of his practical
13522: Reason.-- We should therefore not say: it is necessary _for morals_
13523: [Sittlichkeit], to assume the happiness of all rational beings of the
13524: world in proportion to their morality [Moralität]; but rather, this
13525: is necessitated _by_ morality. Accordingly, this is a _subjective_
13526: argument sufficient for moral beings.

13532: [137] In a practical sense that religion is always idolatry which

13534: something else besides morality can be a fit condition for that which
13535: man can do being in accordance with His Will. For however pure and
13536: free from sensible images the concept that we have formed may be in a
13537: theoretical point of view, yet it will be in a practical point of view

13551: the relation between reasons and consequences (causes and effects), so
13552: far as it is to be found, notwithstanding the specific difference of
13553: the things or those properties in them which contain the reason for
13554: like consequences (_i.e._ considered apart from this relation). Thus we
13555: conceive of the artificial constructions of beasts by comparing them
13556: with those of men; by comparing the ground of those effects brought
13557: about by the former, which we do not know, with the ground of similar
13558: effects brought about by men (reason), which we do know; _i.e._ we
13559: regard the ground of the former as an analogon of reason. We then try
13560: at the same time to show that the ground of the artisan faculty of
13561: beasts, which we call instinct, specifically different as it is in fact
13562: from reason, has yet a similar relation to its effect (the buildings of
13563: the beaver as compared with those of men).--But then I cannot therefore
13564: conclude that because man uses _reason_ for his building, the beaver
13565: must have the like, and call this a _conclusion_ according to analogy.
13566: But from the similarity of the mode of operation of beasts (of which
13567: we cannot immediately perceive the ground) to that of men (of which we
13568: are immediately conscious), we can quite rightly conclude _according
13569: to analogy_, that beasts too act in accordance with _representations_
13570: (not as _Descartes_ has it, that they are machines), and that despite
13571: their specific distinction they are yet (as living beings) of the same
13572: genus as man. The principle of our right so to conclude consists in
13573: the sameness of the ground for reckoning beasts in respect of the said
13574: determination in the same genus with men, regarded as men, so far as we
13575: can externally compare them with one another in accordance with their
13576: actions. There is _par ratio_. Just so I can conceive, according to the
13577: analogy of an Understanding, the causality of the supreme World-Cause,
13578: by comparing its purposive products in the world with the artificial
13579: works of men; but I cannot conclude according to analogy to those
13580: properties in it [which are in man], because here the principle of the
13581: possibility of such a method of reasoning entirely fails, viz. the
13582: _paritas rationis_ for counting the Supreme Being in one and the same
13583: genus with man (in respect of the causality of both). The causality
13584: of the beings of the world, which is always sensibly conditioned (as
13585: is causality through Understanding) cannot be transferred to a Being
13586: which has in common with them no generic concept save that of Thing in
13587: general.
13588: 
13589: [142] We thus miss nothing in the representation of the relations of
13590: this Being to the world, as far as the consequences, theoretical or

13592: it is in itself, is a curiosity as purposeless as it is vain.

13646: in our power; and I can quite well abstract from the possibility or
13647: the unattainableness of purposes which I am obliged to promote in
13648: conformity with that law (because in them consists only the external
13649: worth of my actions) as something which is never completely in my
13650: power, in order only to look to that which is of my doing. But then
13651: the design of promoting the final purpose of all rational beings
13652: (happiness so far as it is possible for it to be accordant with duty)
13653: is even yet prescribed by the law of duty. The speculative Reason,
13654: however, does not see at all the attainableness of this (neither on
13655: the side of our own physical faculty nor on that of the co-operation
13656: of nature). It must rather, so far as we can judge in a rational way,
13657: hold the derivation, by the aid of such causes, of such a consequence
13658: of our good conduct from mere nature (internal and external) without
13659: God and immortality, to be an ungrounded and vain, though well-meant,
13660: expectation; and if it could have complete certainty of this judgement,
13661: it would regard the moral law itself as the mere deception of our
13662: Reason in a practical aspect. But since the speculative Reason fully
13663: convinces itself that the latter can never take place, but that on the
13664: other hand those Ideas whose object lies outside nature can be thought
13665: without contradiction, it must for its own practical law and the
13666: problem prescribed thereby, and therefore in a moral aspect, recognise
13667: those Ideas as real in order not to come into contradiction with itself.
13668: 
13669: [152] It is a trust in the promise of the moral law; [not however such
13670: as is contained in it, but such as I put into it and that on morally
13671: adequate grounds.[153] For a final purpose cannot be commanded by any
13672: law of Reason without this latter at the same time promising, however
13673: uncertainly, its attainableness; and thus justifying our belief in
13674: the special conditions under which alone our Reason can think it as
13675: attainable. The word _fides_ expresses this; and it can only appear
13676: doubtful, how this expression and this particular Idea came into moral
13677: philosophy, since it first was introduced with Christianity, and the
13678: adoption of it perhaps might seem to be only a flattering imitation
13679: of Christian terminology. But this is not the only case in which this
13680: wonderful religion with its great simplicity of statement has enriched
13681: philosophy with far more definite and purer concepts of morality, than
13682: it had been able to furnish before; but which, once they are there, are
13683: _freely_ assented to by Reason and are assumed as concepts to which
13684: it could well have come of itself and which it could and should have
13685: introduced.]
