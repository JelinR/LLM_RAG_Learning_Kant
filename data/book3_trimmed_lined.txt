324: PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION 1781
325: 
326: 
327: Human reason, in one sphere of its cognition, is called upon to
328: consider questions, which it cannot decline, as they are presented by
329: its own nature, but which it cannot answer, as they transcend every
330: faculty of the mind.
331: 
332: It falls into this difficulty without any fault of its own. It begins
333: with principles, which cannot be dispensed with in the field of
334: experience, and the truth and sufficiency of which are, at the same
335: time, insured by experience. With these principles it rises, in
336: obedience to the laws of its own nature, to ever higher and more remote
337: conditions. But it quickly discovers that, in this way, its labours
338: must remain ever incomplete, because new questions never cease to
339: present themselves; and thus it finds itself compelled to have recourse
340: to principles which transcend the region of experience, while they are
341: regarded by common sense without distrust. It thus falls into confusion
342: and contradictions, from which it conjectures the presence of latent
343: errors, which, however, it is unable to discover, because the
344: principles it employs, transcending the limits of experience, cannot be
345: tested by that criterion. The arena of these endless contests is called
346: _Metaphysic_.
347: 
348: Time was, when she was the _queen_ of all the sciences; and, if we take
349: the will for the deed, she certainly deserves, so far as regards the
350: high importance of her object-matter, this title of honour. Now, it is
351: the fashion of the time to heap contempt and scorn upon her; and the
352: matron mourns, forlorn and forsaken, like Hecuba:
353: 
354: Modo maxima rerum,
355: Tot generis, natisque potens...
356: Nunc trahor exul, inops.
357: —Ovid, Metamorphoses. xiii
358: 
359: 
360: At first, her government, under the administration of the _dogmatists_,
361: was an absolute _despotism_. But, as the legislative continued to show
362: traces of the ancient barbaric rule, her empire gradually broke up, and
363: intestine wars introduced the reign of _anarchy;_ while the _sceptics_,
364: like nomadic tribes, who hate a permanent habitation and settled mode
365: of living, attacked from time to time those who had organized
366: themselves into civil communities. But their number was, very happily,
367: small; and thus they could not entirely put a stop to the exertions of
368: those who persisted in raising new edifices, although on no settled or
369: uniform plan. In recent times the hope dawned upon us of seeing those
370: disputes settled, and the legitimacy of her claims established by a
371: kind of _physiology_ of the human understanding—that of the celebrated
372: Locke. But it was found that—although it was affirmed that this
373: so-called queen could not refer her descent to any higher source than
374: that of common experience, a circumstance which necessarily brought
375: suspicion on her claims—as this _genealogy_ was incorrect, she
376: persisted in the advancement of her claims to sovereignty. Thus
377: metaphysics necessarily fell back into the antiquated and rotten
378: constitution of _dogmatism_, and again became obnoxious to the contempt
379: from which efforts had been made to save it. At present, as all
380: methods, according to the general persuasion, have been tried in vain,
381: there reigns nought but weariness and complete _indifferentism_—the
382: mother of chaos and night in the scientific world, but at the same time
383: the source of, or at least the prelude to, the re-creation and
384: reinstallation of a science, when it has fallen into confusion,
385: obscurity, and disuse from ill directed effort.
386: 
387: For it is in reality vain to profess _indifference_ in regard to such
388: inquiries, the object of which cannot be indifferent to humanity.
389: Besides, these pretended _indifferentists_, however much they may try
390: to disguise themselves by the assumption of a popular style and by
391: changes on the language of the schools, unavoidably fall into
392: metaphysical declarations and propositions, which they profess to
393: regard with so much contempt. At the same time, this indifference,
394: which has arisen in the world of science, and which relates to that
395: kind of knowledge which we should wish to see destroyed the last, is a
396: phenomenon that well deserves our attention and reflection. It is
397: plainly not the effect of the levity, but of the matured _judgement_[1]
398: of the age, which refuses to be any longer entertained with illusory
399: knowledge, It is, in fact, a call to reason, again to undertake the
400: most laborious of all tasks—that of self-examination, and to establish
401: a tribunal, which may secure it in its well-grounded claims, while it
402: pronounces against all baseless assumptions and pretensions, not in an
403: arbitrary manner, but according to its own eternal and unchangeable
404: laws. This tribunal is nothing less than the _Critical Investigation of
405: Pure Reason_.
406: 
407:  [1] We very often hear complaints of the shallowness of the present
408:  age, and of the decay of profound science. But I do not think that
409:  those which rest upon a secure foundation, such as mathematics,
410:  physical science, etc., in the least deserve this reproach, but that
411:  they rather maintain their ancient fame, and in the latter case,
412:  indeed, far surpass it. The same would be the case with the other
413:  kinds of cognition, if their principles were but firmly established.
414:  In the absence of this security, indifference, doubt, and finally,
415:  severe criticism are rather signs of a profound habit of thought. Our
416:  age is the age of criticism, to which everything must be subjected.
417:  The sacredness of religion, and the authority of legislation, are by
418:  many regarded as grounds of exemption from the examination of this
419:  tribunal. But, if they are exempted, they become the subjects of just
420:  suspicion, and cannot lay claim to sincere respect, which reason
421:  accords only to that which has stood the test of a free and public
422:  examination.
423: 
424: 
425: I do not mean by this a criticism of books and systems, but a critical
426: inquiry into the faculty of reason, with reference to the cognitions to
427: which it strives to attain _without the aid of experience;_ in other
428: words, the solution of the question regarding the possibility or
429: impossibility of metaphysics, and the determination of the origin, as
430: well as of the extent and limits of this science. All this must be done
431: on the basis of principles.
432: 
433: This path—the only one now remaining—has been entered upon by me; and I
434: flatter myself that I have, in this way, discovered the cause of—and
435: consequently the mode of removing—all the errors which have hitherto
436: set reason at variance with itself, in the sphere of non-empirical
437: thought. I have not returned an evasive answer to the questions of
438: reason, by alleging the inability and limitation of the faculties of
439: the mind; I have, on the contrary, examined them completely in the
440: light of principles, and, after having discovered the cause of the
441: doubts and contradictions into which reason fell, have solved them to
442: its perfect satisfaction. It is true, these questions have not been
443: solved as dogmatism, in its vain fancies and desires, had expected; for
444: it can only be satisfied by the exercise of magical arts, and of these
445: I have no knowledge. But neither do these come within the compass of
446: our mental powers; and it was the duty of philosophy to destroy the
447: illusions which had their origin in misconceptions, whatever darling
448: hopes and valued expectations may be ruined by its explanations. My
449: chief aim in this work has been thoroughness; and I make bold to say
450: that there is not a single metaphysical problem that does not find its
451: solution, or at least the key to its solution, here. Pure reason is a
452: perfect unity; and therefore, if the principle presented by it prove to
453: be insufficient for the solution of even a single one of those
454: questions to which the very nature of reason gives birth, we must
455: reject it, as we could not be perfectly certain of its sufficiency in
456: the case of the others.
457: 
458: While I say this, I think I see upon the countenance of the reader
459: signs of dissatisfaction mingled with contempt, when he hears
460: declarations which sound so boastful and extravagant; and yet they are
461: beyond comparison more moderate than those advanced by the commonest
462: author of the commonest philosophical programme, in which the dogmatist
463: professes to demonstrate the simple nature of the soul, or the
464: necessity of a primal being. Such a dogmatist promises to extend human
465: knowledge beyond the limits of possible experience; while I humbly
466: confess that this is completely beyond my power. Instead of any such
467: attempt, I confine myself to the examination of reason alone and its
468: pure thought; and I do not need to seek far for the sum-total of its
469: cognition, because it has its seat in my own mind. Besides, common
470: logic presents me with a complete and systematic catalogue of all the
471: simple operations of reason; and it is my task to answer the question
472: how far reason can go, without the material presented and the aid
473: furnished by experience.
474: 
475: So much for the completeness and thoroughness necessary in the
476: execution of the present task. The aims set before us are not
477: arbitrarily proposed, but are imposed upon us by the nature of
478: cognition itself.
479: 
480: The above remarks relate to the _matter_ of our critical inquiry. As
481: regards the _form_, there are two indispensable conditions, which any
482: one who undertakes so difficult a task as that of a critique of pure
483: reason, is bound to fulfil. These conditions are _certitude_ and
484: _clearness_.
485: 
486: As regards _certitude_, I have fully convinced myself that, in this
487: sphere of thought, _opinion_ is perfectly inadmissible, and that
488: everything which bears the least semblance of an hypothesis must be
489: excluded, as of no value in such discussions. For it is a necessary
490: condition of every cognition that is to be established upon _à priori_
491: grounds that it shall be held to be absolutely necessary; much more is
492: this the case with an attempt to determine all pure _à priori_
493: cognition, and to furnish the standard—and consequently an example—of
494: all apodeictic (philosophical) certitude. Whether I have succeeded in
495: what I professed to do, it is for the reader to determine; it is the
496: author’s business merely to adduce grounds and reasons, without
497: determining what influence these ought to have on the mind of his
498: judges. But, lest anything he may have said may become the innocent
499: cause of doubt in their minds, or tend to weaken the effect which his
500: arguments might otherwise produce—he may be allowed to point out those
501: passages which may occasion mistrust or difficulty, although these do
502: not concern the main purpose of the present work. He does this solely
503: with the view of removing from the mind of the reader any doubts which
504: might affect his judgement of the work as a whole, and in regard to its
505: ultimate aim.
506: 
507: I know no investigations more necessary for a full insight into the
508: nature of the faculty which we call _understanding_, and at the same
509: time for the determination of the rules and limits of its use, than
510: those undertaken in the second chapter of the “Transcendental
511: Analytic,” under the title of _Deduction of the Pure Conceptions of the
512: Understanding;_ and they have also cost me by far the greatest
513: labour—labour which, I hope, will not remain uncompensated. The view
514: there taken, which goes somewhat deeply into the subject, has two
515: sides. The one relates to the objects of the pure understanding, and is
516: intended to demonstrate and to render comprehensible the objective
517: validity of its _à priori_ conceptions; and it forms for this reason an
518: essential part of the Critique. The other considers the pure
519: understanding itself, its possibility and its powers of cognition—that
520: is, from a subjective point of view; and, although this exposition is
521: of great importance, it does not belong essentially to the main purpose
522: of the work, because the grand question is what and how much can reason
523: and understanding, apart from experience, cognize, and not, how is the
524: _faculty of thought_ itself possible? As the latter is an inquiry into
525: the cause of a given effect, and has thus in it some semblance of an
526: hypothesis (although, as I shall show on another occasion, this is
527: really not the fact), it would seem that, in the present instance, I
528: had allowed myself to enounce a mere _opinion_, and that the reader
529: must therefore be at liberty to hold a different _opinion_. But I beg
530: to remind him that, if my subjective deduction does not produce in his
531: mind the conviction of its certitude at which I aimed, the objective
532: deduction, with which alone the present work is properly concerned, is
533: in every respect satisfactory.
534: 
535: As regards _clearness_, the reader has a right to demand, in the first
536: place, _discursive_ or logical clearness, that is, on the basis of
537: conceptions, and, secondly, _intuitive_ or æsthetic clearness, by means
538: of intuitions, that is, by examples or other modes of illustration _in
539: concreto_. I have done what I could for the first kind of
540: intelligibility. This was essential to my purpose; and it thus became
541: the accidental cause of my inability to do complete justice to the
542: second requirement. I have been almost always at a loss, during the
543: progress of this work, how to settle this question. Examples and
544: illustrations always appeared to me necessary, and, in the first sketch
545: of the Critique, naturally fell into their proper places. But I very
546: soon became aware of the magnitude of my task, and the numerous
547: problems with which I should be engaged; and, as I perceived that this
548: critical investigation would, even if delivered in the driest
549: _scholastic_ manner, be far from being brief, I found it unadvisable to
550: enlarge it still more with examples and explanations, which are
551: necessary only from a _popular_ point of view. I was induced to take
552: this course from the consideration also that the present work is not
553: intended for popular use, that those devoted to science do not require
554: such helps, although they are always acceptable, and that they would
555: have materially interfered with my present purpose. Abbé Terrasson
556: remarks with great justice that, if we estimate the size of a work, not
557: from the number of its pages, but from the time which we require to
558: make ourselves master of it, it may be said of many a book—_that it
559: would be much shorter, if it were not so short_. On the other hand, as
560: regards the comprehensibility of a system of speculative cognition,
561: connected under a single principle, we may say with equal justice: many
562: a book would have been much clearer, if it had not been intended to be
563: so very clear. For explanations and examples, and other helps to
564: intelligibility, aid us in the comprehension of _parts_, but they
565: distract the attention, dissipate the mental power of the reader, and
566: stand in the way of his forming a clear conception of the _whole;_ as
567: he cannot attain soon enough to a survey of the system, and the
568: colouring and embellishments bestowed upon it prevent his observing its
569: articulation or organization—which is the most important consideration
570: with him, when he comes to judge of its unity and stability.
571: 
572: The reader must naturally have a strong inducement to co-operate with
573: the present author, if he has formed the intention of erecting a
574: complete and solid edifice of metaphysical science, according to the
575: plan now laid before him. Metaphysics, as here represented, is the only
576: science which admits of completion—and with little labour, if it is
577: united, in a short time; so that nothing will be left to future
578: generations except the task of illustrating and applying it
579: _didactically_. For this science is nothing more than the inventory of
580: all that is given us by _pure reason_, systematically arranged. Nothing
581: can escape our notice; for what reason produces from itself cannot lie
582: concealed, but must be brought to the light by reason itself, so soon
583: as we have discovered the common principle of the ideas we seek. The
584: perfect unity of this kind of cognitions, which are based upon pure
585: conceptions, and uninfluenced by any empirical element, or any peculiar
586: intuition leading to determinate experience, renders this completeness
587: not only practicable, but also necessary.

593: Such a system of pure speculative reason I hope to be able to publish
594: under the title of _Metaphysic of Nature_[2]. The content of this work
595: (which will not be half so long) will be very much richer than that of
596: the present Critique, which has to discover the sources of this
597: cognition and expose the conditions of its possibility, and at the same
598: time to clear and level a fit foundation for the scientific edifice. In
599: the present work, I look for the patient hearing and the impartiality
600: of a _judge;_ in the other, for the good-will and assistance of a
601: _co-labourer_. For, however complete the list of _principles_ for this
602: system may be in the Critique, the correctness of the system requires
603: that no _deduced_ conceptions should be absent. These cannot be
604: presented _à priori_, but must be gradually discovered; and, while the
605: _synthesis_ of conceptions has been fully exhausted in the Critique, it
606: is necessary that, in the proposed work, the same should be the case
607: with their _analysis_. But this will be rather an amusement than a
608: labour.

616: PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION 1787
617: 
618: 
619: Whether the treatment of that portion of our knowledge which lies
620: within the province of pure reason advances with that undeviating
621: certainty which characterizes the progress of _science_, we shall be at
622: no loss to determine. If we find those who are engaged in metaphysical
623: pursuits, unable to come to an understanding as to the method which
624: they ought to follow; if we find them, after the most elaborate
625: preparations, invariably brought to a stand before the goal is reached,
626: and compelled to retrace their steps and strike into fresh paths, we
627: may then feel quite sure that they are far from having attained to the
628: certainty of scientific progress and may rather be said to be merely
629: groping about in the dark. In these circumstances we shall render an
630: important service to reason if we succeed in simply indicating the path
631: along which it must travel, in order to arrive at any results—even if
632: it should be found necessary to abandon many of those aims which,
633: without reflection, have been proposed for its attainment.
634: 
635: That _Logic_ has advanced in this sure course, even from the earliest
636: times, is apparent from the fact that, since Aristotle, it has been
637: unable to advance a step and, thus, to all appearance has reached its
638: completion. For, if some of the moderns have thought to enlarge its
639: domain by introducing _psychological_ discussions on the mental
640: faculties, such as imagination and wit, _metaphysical_, discussions on
641: the origin of knowledge and the different kinds of certitude, according
642: to the difference of the objects (idealism, scepticism, and so on), or
643: _anthropological_ discussions on prejudices, their causes and remedies:
644: this attempt, on the part of these authors, only shows their ignorance
645: of the peculiar nature of logical science. We do not enlarge but
646: disfigure the sciences when we lose sight of their respective limits
647: and allow them to run into one another. Now logic is enclosed within
648: limits which admit of perfectly clear definition; it is a science which
649: has for its object nothing but the exposition and proof of the _formal_
650: laws of all thought, whether it be _à priori_ or empirical, whatever be
651: its origin or its object, and whatever the difficulties—natural or
652: accidental—which it encounters in the human mind.
653: 
654: The early success of logic must be attributed exclusively to the
655: narrowness of its field, in which abstraction may, or rather must, be
656: made of all the objects of cognition with their characteristic
657: distinctions, and in which the understanding has only to deal with
658: itself and with its own forms. It is, obviously, a much more difficult
659: task for reason to strike into the sure path of science, where it has
660: to deal not simply with itself, but with objects external to itself.
661: Hence, logic is properly only a _propædeutic_—forms, as it were, the
662: vestibule of the sciences; and while it is necessary to enable us to
663: form a correct judgement with regard to the various branches of
664: knowledge, still the acquisition of real, substantive knowledge is to
665: be sought only in the sciences properly so called, that is, in the
666: objective sciences.
667: 
668: Now these sciences, if they can be termed rational at all, must contain
669: elements of _à priori_ cognition, and this cognition may stand in a
670: twofold relation to its object. Either it may have to _determine_ the
671: conception of the object—which must be supplied extraneously, or it may
672: have to _establish its reality_. The former is _theoretical_, the
673: latter _practical_, rational cognition. In both, the _pure_ or _à
674: priori_ element must be treated first, and must be carefully
675: distinguished from that which is supplied from other sources. Any other
676: method can only lead to irremediable confusion.
677: 
678: _Mathematics_ and _physics_ are the two theoretical sciences which have
679: to determine their objects _à priori_. The former is purely _à priori_,
680: the latter is partially so, but is also dependent on other sources of
681: cognition.
682: 
683: In the earliest times of which history affords us any record,
684: _mathematics_ had already entered on the sure course of science, among
685: that wonderful nation, the Greeks. Still it is not to be supposed that
686: it was as easy for this science to strike into, or rather to construct
687: for itself, that royal road, as it was for logic, in which reason has
688: only to deal with itself. On the contrary, I believe that it must have
689: remained long—chiefly among the Egyptians—in the stage of blind groping
690: after its true aims and destination, and that it was revolutionized by
691: the happy idea of one man, who struck out and determined for all time
692: the path which this science must follow, and which admits of an
693: indefinite advancement. The history of this intellectual
694: revolution—much more important in its results than the discovery of the
695: passage round the celebrated Cape of Good Hope—and of its author, has
696: not been preserved. But Diogenes Laertius, in naming the supposed
697: discoverer of some of the simplest elements of geometrical
698: demonstration—elements which, according to the ordinary opinion, do not
699: even require to be proved—makes it apparent that the change introduced
700: by the first indication of this new path, must have seemed of the
701: utmost importance to the mathematicians of that age, and it has thus
702: been secured against the chance of oblivion. A new light must have
703: flashed on the mind of the first man (_Thales_, or whatever may have
704: been his name) who demonstrated the properties of the _isosceles_
705: triangle. For he found that it was not sufficient to meditate on the
706: figure, as it lay before his eyes, or the conception of it, as it
707: existed in his mind, and thus endeavour to get at the knowledge of its
708: properties, but that it was necessary to produce these properties, as
709: it were, by a positive _à priori construction;_ and that, in order to
710: arrive with certainty at _à priori_ cognition, he must not attribute to
711: the object any other properties than those which necessarily followed
712: from that which he had himself, in accordance with his conception,
713: placed in the object.
714: 
715: A much longer period elapsed before _Physics_ entered on the highway of
716: science. For it is only about a century and a half since the wise BACON
717: gave a new direction to physical studies, or rather—as others were
718: already on the right track—imparted fresh vigour to the pursuit of this
719: new direction. Here, too, as in the case of mathematics, we find
720: evidence of a rapid intellectual revolution. In the remarks which
721: follow I shall confine myself to the _empirical_ side of natural
722: science.
723: 
724: When GALILEI experimented with balls of a definite weight on the
725: inclined plane, when TORRICELLI caused the air to sustain a weight
726: which he had calculated beforehand to be equal to that of a definite
727: column of water, or when STAHL, at a later period, converted metals
728: into lime, and reconverted lime into metal, by the addition and
729: subtraction of certain elements;[3] a light broke upon all natural
730: philosophers. They learned that reason only perceives that which it
731: produces after its own design; that it must not be content to follow,
732: as it were, in the leading-strings of nature, but must proceed in
733: advance with principles of judgement according to unvarying laws, and
734: compel nature to reply its questions. For accidental observations, made
735: according to no preconceived plan, cannot be united under a necessary
736: law. But it is this that reason seeks for and requires. It is only the
737: principles of reason which can give to concordant phenomena the
738: validity of laws, and it is only when experiment is directed by these
739: rational principles that it can have any real utility. Reason must
740: approach nature with the view, indeed, of receiving information from
741: it, not, however, in the character of a pupil, who listens to all that
742: his master chooses to tell him, but in that of a judge, who compels the
743: witnesses to reply to those questions which he himself thinks fit to
744: propose. To this single idea must the revolution be ascribed, by which,
745: after groping in the dark for so many centuries, natural science was at
746: length conducted into the path of certain progress.
747: 
748:  [3] I do not here follow with exactness the history of the
749:  experimental method, of which, indeed, the first steps are involved in
750:  some obscurity.
751: 
752: 
753: We come now to _metaphysics_, a purely speculative science, which
754: occupies a completely isolated position and is entirely independent of
755: the teachings of experience. It deals with mere conceptions—not, like
756: mathematics, with conceptions applied to intuition—and in it, reason is
757: the pupil of itself alone. It is the oldest of the sciences, and would
758: still survive, even if all the rest were swallowed up in the abyss of
759: an all-destroying barbarism. But it has not yet had the good fortune to
760: attain to the sure scientific method. This will be apparent; if we
761: apply the tests which we proposed at the outset. We find that reason
762: perpetually comes to a stand, when it attempts to gain _à priori_ the
763: perception even of those laws which the most common experience
764: confirms. We find it compelled to retrace its steps in innumerable
765: instances, and to abandon the path on which it had entered, because
766: this does not lead to the desired result. We find, too, that those who
767: are engaged in metaphysical pursuits are far from being able to agree
768: among themselves, but that, on the contrary, this science appears to
769: furnish an arena specially adapted for the display of skill or the
770: exercise of strength in mock-contests—a field in which no combatant
771: ever yet succeeded in gaining an inch of ground, in which, at least, no
772: victory was ever yet crowned with permanent possession.
773: 
774: This leads us to inquire why it is that, in metaphysics, the sure path
775: of science has not hitherto been found. Shall we suppose that it is
776: impossible to discover it? Why then should nature have visited our
777: reason with restless aspirations after it, as if it were one of our
778: weightiest concerns? Nay, more, how little cause should we have to
779: place confidence in our reason, if it abandons us in a matter about
780: which, most of all, we desire to know the truth—and not only so, but
781: even allures us to the pursuit of vain phantoms, only to betray us in
782: the end? Or, if the path has only hitherto been missed, what
783: indications do we possess to guide us in a renewed investigation, and
784: to enable us to hope for greater success than has fallen to the lot of
785: our predecessors?
786: 
787: It appears to me that the examples of mathematics and natural
788: philosophy, which, as we have seen, were brought into their present
789: condition by a sudden revolution, are sufficiently remarkable to fix
790: our attention on the essential circumstances of the change which has
791: proved so advantageous to them, and to induce us to make the experiment
792: of imitating them, so far as the analogy which, as rational sciences,
793: they bear to metaphysics may permit. It has hitherto been assumed that
794: our cognition must conform to the objects; but all attempts to
795: ascertain anything about these objects _à priori_, by means of
796: conceptions, and thus to extend the range of our knowledge, have been
797: rendered abortive by this assumption. Let us then make the experiment
798: whether we may not be more successful in metaphysics, if we assume that
799: the objects must conform to our cognition. This appears, at all events,
800: to accord better with the _possibility_ of our gaining the end we have
801: in view, that is to say, of arriving at the cognition of objects _à
802: priori_, of determining something with respect to these objects, before
803: they are given to us. We here propose to do just what COPERNICUS did in
804: attempting to explain the celestial movements. When he found that he
805: could make no progress by assuming that all the heavenly bodies
806: revolved round the spectator, he reversed the process, and tried the
807: experiment of assuming that the spectator revolved, while the stars
808: remained at rest. We may make the same experiment with regard to the
809: intuition of objects. If the intuition must conform to the nature of
810: the objects, I do not see how we can know anything of them _à priori_.
811: If, on the other hand, the object conforms to the nature of our faculty
812: of intuition, I can then easily conceive the possibility of such an _à
813: priori_ knowledge. Now as I cannot rest in the mere intuitions, but—if
814: they are to become cognitions—must refer them, as _representations_, to
815: something, as _object_, and must determine the latter by means of the
816: former, here again there are two courses open to me. _Either_, first, I
817: may assume that the conceptions, by which I effect this determination,
818: conform to the object—and in this case I am reduced to the same
819: perplexity as before; _or_ secondly, I may assume that the objects, or,
820: which is the same thing, that _experience_, in which alone as given
821: objects they are cognized, conform to my conceptions—and then I am at
822: no loss how to proceed. For experience itself is a mode of cognition
823: which requires understanding. Before objects, are given to me, that is,
824: _à priori_, I must presuppose in myself laws of the understanding which
825: are expressed in conceptions _à priori_. To these conceptions, then,
826: all the objects of experience must necessarily conform. Now there are
827: objects which reason _thinks_, and that necessarily, but which cannot
828: be given in experience, or, at least, cannot be given _so_ as reason
829: thinks them. The attempt to think these objects will hereafter furnish
830: an excellent test of the new method of thought which we have adopted,
831: and which is based on the principle that we only cognize in things _à
832: priori_ that which we ourselves place in them.[4]
833: 
834:  [4] This method, accordingly, which we have borrowed from the natural
835:  philosopher, consists in seeking for the elements of pure reason in
836:  that _which admits of confirmation or refutation by experiment_. Now
837:  the propositions of pure reason, especially when they transcend the
838:  limits of possible experience, do not admit of our making any
839:  experiment with their _objects_, as in natural science. Hence, with
840:  regard to those _conceptions_ and _principles_ which we assume _à
841:  priori_, our only course will be to view them from two different
842:  sides. We must regard one and the same conception, _on the one hand_,
843:  in relation to experience as an object of the senses and of the
844:  understanding, _on the other hand_, in relation to reason, isolated
845:  and transcending the limits of experience, as an object of mere
846:  thought. Now if we find that, when we regard things from this double
847:  point of view, the result is in harmony with the principle of pure
848:  reason, but that, when we regard them from a single point of view,
849:  reason is involved in self-contradiction, then the experiment will
850:  establish the correctness of this distinction.
851: 
852: 
853: This attempt succeeds as well as we could desire, and promises to
854: metaphysics, in its first part—that is, where it is occupied with
855: conceptions _à priori_, of which the corresponding objects may be given
856: in experience—the certain course of science. For by this new method we
857: are enabled perfectly to explain the possibility of _à priori_
858: cognition, and, what is more, to demonstrate satisfactorily the laws
859: which lie _à priori_ at the foundation of nature, as the sum of the
860: objects of experience—neither of which was possible according to the
861: procedure hitherto followed. But from this deduction of the faculty of
862: _à priori_ cognition in the first part of metaphysics, we derive a
863: surprising result, and one which, to all appearance, militates against
864: the great end of metaphysics, as treated in the second part. For we
865: come to the conclusion that our faculty of cognition is unable to
866: transcend the limits of possible experience; and yet this is precisely
867: the most essential object of this science. The estimate of our rational
868: cognition _à priori_ at which we arrive is that it has only to do with
869: phenomena, and that things in themselves, while possessing a real
870: existence, lie beyond its sphere. Here we are enabled to put the
871: justice of this estimate to the test. For that which of necessity
872: impels us to transcend the limits of experience and of all phenomena is
873: the _unconditioned_, which reason absolutely requires in things as they
874: are in themselves, in order to complete the series of conditions. Now,
875: if it appears that when, on the one hand, we assume that our cognition
876: conforms to its objects as things in themselves, _the unconditioned
877: cannot be thought without contradiction_, and that when, on the other
878: hand, we assume that our representation of things as they are given to
879: us, does not conform to these things as they are in themselves, but
880: that these objects, as phenomena, conform to our mode of
881: representation, _the contradiction disappears:_ we shall then be
882: convinced of the truth of that which we began by assuming for the sake
883: of experiment; we may look upon it as established that the
884: unconditioned does not lie in things as we know them, or as they are
885: given to us, but in things as they are in themselves, beyond the range
886: of our cognition.[5]
887: 
888:  [5] This experiment of pure reason has a great similarity to that of
889:  the _Chemists_, which they term the experiment of _reduction_, or,
890:  more usually, the _synthetic_ process. The _analysis_ of the
891:  metaphysician separates pure cognition _à priori_ into two
892:  heterogeneous elements, viz., the cognition of things as phenomena,
893:  and of things in themselves. _Dialectic_ combines these again into
894:  harmony with the necessary rational idea of the unconditioned, and
895:  finds that this harmony never results except through the above
896:  distinction, which is, therefore, concluded to be just.
897: 
898: 
899: But, after we have thus denied the power of speculative reason to make
900: any progress in the sphere of the supersensible, it still remains for
901: our consideration whether data do not exist in _practical_ cognition
902: which may enable us to determine the transcendent conception of the
903: unconditioned, to rise beyond the limits of all possible experience
904: from a _practical_ point of view, and thus to satisfy the great ends of
905: metaphysics. Speculative reason has thus, at least, made room for such
906: an extension of our knowledge: and, if it must leave this space vacant,
907: still it does not rob us of the liberty to fill it up, if we can, by
908: means of practical data—nay, it even challenges us to make the
909: attempt.[6]
910: 
911:  [6] So the central laws of the movements of the heavenly bodies
912:  established the truth of that which Copernicus, first, assumed only as
913:  a hypothesis, and, at the same time, brought to light that invisible
914:  force (Newtonian attraction) which holds the universe together. The
915:  latter would have remained forever undiscovered, if Copernicus had not
916:  ventured on the experiment—contrary to the senses but still just—of
917:  looking for the observed movements not in the heavenly bodies, but in
918:  the spectator. In this Preface I treat the new metaphysical method as
919:  a hypothesis with the view of rendering apparent the first attempts at
920:  such a change of method, which are always hypothetical. But in the
921:  Critique itself it will be demonstrated, not hypothetically, but
922:  apodeictically, from the nature of our representations of space and
923:  time, and from the elementary conceptions of the understanding.
924: 
925: 
926: This attempt to introduce a complete revolution in the procedure of
927: metaphysics, after the _example_ of the geometricians and natural
928: philosophers, constitutes the aim of the Critique of Pure Speculative
929: Reason. It is a treatise on the method to be followed, not a system of
930: the science itself. But, at the same time, it marks out and defines
931: both the external boundaries and the internal structure of this
932: science. For pure speculative reason has this peculiarity, that, in
933: choosing the various objects of thought, it is able to define the
934: limits of its own faculties, and even to give a complete enumeration of
935: the possible modes of proposing problems to itself, and thus to sketch
936: out the entire system of metaphysics. For, on the one hand, in
937: cognition _à priori_, nothing must be attributed to the objects but
938: what the thinking subject derives from itself; and, on the other hand,
939: reason is, in regard to the principles of cognition, a perfectly
940: distinct, independent unity, in which, as in an organized body, every
941: member exists for the sake of the others, and all for the sake of each,
942: so that no principle can be viewed, with safety, in one relationship,
943: unless it is, at the same time, viewed in relation to the total use of
944: pure reason. Hence, too, metaphysics has this singular advantage—an
945: advantage which falls to the lot of no other science which has to do
946: with _objects_—that, if once it is conducted into the sure path of
947: science, by means of this criticism, it can then take in the whole
948: sphere of its cognitions, and can thus complete its work, and leave it
949: for the use of posterity, as a capital which can never receive fresh
950: accessions. For metaphysics has to deal only with principles and with
951: the limitations of its own employment as determined by these
952: principles. To this perfection it is, therefore, bound, as the
953: fundamental science, to attain, and to it the maxim may justly be
954: applied:
955: 
956:  Nil actum reputans, si quid superesset agendum.
957: 
958: 
959: But, it will be asked, what kind of a treasure is this that we propose
960: to bequeath to posterity? What is the real value of this system of
961: metaphysics, purified by criticism, and thereby reduced to a permanent
962: condition? A cursory view of the present work will lead to the
963: supposition that its use is merely _negative_, that it only serves to
964: warn us against venturing, with speculative reason, beyond the limits
965: of experience. This is, in fact, its primary use. But this, at once,
966: assumes a _positive_ value, when we observe that the principles with
967: which speculative reason endeavours to transcend its limits lead
968: inevitably, not to the _extension_, but to the _contraction_ of the use
969: of reason, inasmuch as they threaten to extend the limits of
970: sensibility, which is their proper sphere, over the entire realm of
971: thought and, thus, to supplant the pure (practical) use of reason. So
972: far, then, as this criticism is occupied in confining speculative
973: reason within its proper bounds, it is only negative; but, inasmuch as
974: it thereby, at the same time, removes an obstacle which impedes and
975: even threatens to destroy the use of practical reason, it possesses a
976: positive and very important value. In order to admit this, we have only
977: to be convinced that there is an absolutely necessary use of pure
978: reason—the moral use—in which it inevitably transcends the limits of
979: sensibility, without the aid of speculation, requiring only to be
980: insured against the effects of a speculation which would involve it in
981: contradiction with itself. To deny the positive advantage of the
982: service which this criticism renders us would be as absurd as to
983: maintain that the system of police is productive of no positive
984: benefit, since its main business is to prevent the violence which
985: citizen has to apprehend from citizen, that so each may pursue his
986: vocation in peace and security. That space and time are only forms of
987: sensible intuition, and hence are only conditions of the existence of
988: things as phenomena; that, moreover, we have no conceptions of the
989: understanding, and, consequently, no elements for the cognition of
990: things, except in so far as a corresponding intuition can be given to
991: these conceptions; that, accordingly, we can have no cognition of an
992: object, as a thing in itself, but only as an object of sensible
993: intuition, that is, as phenomenon—all this is proved in the analytical
994: part of the Critique; and from this the limitation of all possible
995: speculative cognition to the mere objects of _experience_, follows as a
996: necessary result. At the same time, it must be carefully borne in mind
997: that, while we surrender the power of _cognizing_, we still reserve the
998: power of _thinking_ objects, as things in themselves.[7] For,
999: otherwise, we should require to affirm the existence of an appearance,
1000: without something that appears—which would be absurd. Now let us
1001: suppose, for a moment, that we had not undertaken this criticism and,
1002: accordingly, had not drawn the necessary distinction between things as
1003: objects of experience and things as they are in themselves. The
1004: principle of causality, and, by consequence, the mechanism of nature as
1005: determined by causality, would then have absolute validity in relation
1006: to all things as efficient causes. I should then be unable to assert,
1007: with regard to one and the same being, e.g., the human soul, that its
1008: will is _free_, and yet, at the same time, subject to natural
1009: necessity, that is, _not free_, without falling into a palpable
1010: contradiction, for in both propositions I should take the soul in _the
1011: same signification_, as a thing in general, as a thing in itself—as,
1012: without previous criticism, I could not but take it. Suppose now, on
1013: the other hand, that we _have_ undertaken this criticism, and have
1014: learnt that an object may be taken in _two senses_, first, as a
1015: phenomenon, secondly, as a thing in itself; and that, according to the
1016: deduction of the conceptions of the understanding, the principle of
1017: causality has reference only to things in the first sense. We then see
1018: how it does not involve any contradiction to assert, on the one hand,
1019: that the will, in the phenomenal sphere—in visible action—is
1020: necessarily obedient to the law of nature, and, in so far, _not free;_
1021: and, on the other hand, that, as belonging to a thing in itself, it is
1022: not subject to that law, and, accordingly, is _free_. Now, it is true
1023: that I cannot, by means of speculative reason, and still less by
1024: empirical observation, _cognize_ my soul as a thing in itself and
1025: consequently, cannot cognize liberty as the property of a being to
1026: which I ascribe effects in the world of sense. For, to do so, I must
1027: cognize this being as existing, and yet not in time, which—since I
1028: cannot support my conception by any intuition—is impossible. At the
1029: same time, while I cannot _cognize_, I can quite well _think_ freedom,
1030: that is to say, my representation of it involves at least no
1031: contradiction, if we bear in mind the critical distinction of the two
1032: modes of representation (the sensible and the intellectual) and the
1033: consequent limitation of the conceptions of the pure understanding and
1034: of the principles which flow from them. Suppose now that morality
1035: necessarily presupposed liberty, in the strictest sense, as a property
1036: of our will; suppose that reason contained certain practical, original
1037: principles _à priori_, which were absolutely impossible without this
1038: presupposition; and suppose, at the same time, that speculative reason
1039: had proved that liberty was incapable of being thought at all. It would
1040: then follow that the moral presupposition must give way to the
1041: speculative affirmation, the opposite of which involves an obvious
1042: contradiction, and that _liberty_ and, with it, morality must yield to
1043: the _mechanism of nature;_ for the negation of morality involves no
1044: contradiction, except on the presupposition of liberty. Now morality
1045: does not require the speculative cognition of liberty; it is enough
1046: that I can think it, that its conception involves no contradiction,
1047: that it does not interfere with the mechanism of nature. But even this
1048: requirement we could not satisfy, if we had not learnt the twofold
1049: sense in which things may be taken; and it is only in this way that the
1050: doctrine of morality and the doctrine of nature are confined within
1051: their proper limits. For this result, then, we are indebted to a
1052: criticism which warns us of our unavoidable ignorance with regard to
1053: things in themselves, and establishes the necessary limitation of our
1054: theoretical _cognition_ to mere phenomena.
1055: 
1056:  [7] In order to _cognize_ an object, I must be able to prove its
1057:  possibility, either from its reality as attested by experience, or _à
1058:  priori_, by means of reason. But I can _think_ what I please, provided
1059:  only I do not contradict myself; that is, provided my conception is a
1060:  possible thought, though I may be unable to answer for the existence
1061:  of a corresponding object in the sum of possibilities. But something
1062:  more is required before I can attribute to such a conception objective
1063:  validity, that is real possibility—the other possibility being merely
1064:  logical. We are not, however, confined to theoretical sources of
1065:  cognition for the means of satisfying this additional requirement, but
1066:  may derive them from practical sources.
1067: 
1068: 
1069: The positive value of the critical principles of pure reason in
1070: relation to the conception of _God_ and of the _simple nature_ of the
1071: _soul_, admits of a similar exemplification; but on this point I shall
1072: not dwell. I cannot even make the assumption—as the practical interests
1073: of morality require—of God, freedom, and immortality, if I do not
1074: deprive speculative reason of its pretensions to transcendent insight.
1075: For to arrive at these, it must make use of principles which, in fact,
1076: extend only to the objects of possible experience, and which cannot be
1077: applied to objects beyond this sphere without converting them into
1078: phenomena, and thus rendering the _practical extension_ of pure reason
1079: impossible. I must, therefore, abolish _knowledge_, to make room for
1080: _belief_. The dogmatism of metaphysics, that is, the presumption that
1081: it is possible to advance in metaphysics without previous criticism, is
1082: the true source of the unbelief (always dogmatic) which militates
1083: against morality.
1084: 
1085: Thus, while it may be no very difficult task to bequeath a legacy to
1086: posterity, in the shape of a system of metaphysics constructed in
1087: accordance with the Critique of Pure Reason, still the value of such a
1088: bequest is not to be depreciated. It will render an important service
1089: to reason, by substituting the certainty of scientific method for that
1090: random groping after results without the guidance of principles, which
1091: has hitherto characterized the pursuit of metaphysical studies. It will
1092: render an important service to the inquiring mind of youth, by leading
1093: the student to apply his powers to the cultivation of genuine science,
1094: instead of wasting them, as at present, on speculations which can never
1095: lead to any result, or on the idle attempt to invent new ideas and
1096: opinions. But, above all, it will confer an inestimable benefit on
1097: morality and religion, by showing that all the objections urged against
1098: them may be silenced for ever by the _Socratic_ method, that is to say,
1099: by proving the ignorance of the objector. For, as the world has never
1100: been, and, no doubt, never will be without a system of metaphysics of
1101: one kind or another, it is the highest and weightiest concern of
1102: philosophy to render it powerless for harm, by closing up the sources
1103: of error.
1104: 
1105: This important change in the field of the sciences, this loss of its
1106: fancied possessions, to which speculative reason must submit, does not
1107: prove in any way detrimental to the general interests of humanity. The
1108: advantages which the world has derived from the teachings of pure
1109: reason are not at all impaired. The loss falls, in its whole extent, on
1110: the _monopoly of the schools_, but does not in the slightest degree
1111: touch the _interests of mankind_. I appeal to the most obstinate
1112: dogmatist, whether the proof of the continued existence of the soul
1113: after death, derived from the simplicity of its substance; of the
1114: freedom of the will in opposition to the general mechanism of nature,
1115: drawn from the subtle but impotent distinction of subjective and
1116: objective practical necessity; or of the existence of God, deduced from
1117: the conception of an _ens realissimum_—the contingency of the
1118: changeable, and the necessity of a prime mover, has ever been able to
1119: pass beyond the limits of the schools, to penetrate the public mind, or
1120: to exercise the slightest influence on its convictions. It must be
1121: admitted that this has not been the case and that, owing to the
1122: unfitness of the common understanding for such subtle speculations, it
1123: can never be expected to take place. On the contrary, it is plain that
1124: _the hope of a future life_ arises from the feeling, which exists in
1125: the breast of every man, that the temporal is inadequate to meet and
1126: satisfy the demands of his nature. In like manner, it cannot be doubted
1127: that the clear exhibition of duties in opposition to all the claims of
1128: inclination, gives rise to the consciousness of _freedom_, and that the
1129: glorious order, beauty, and providential care, everywhere displayed in
1130: nature, give rise to the belief in a wise and great Author of the
1131: Universe. Such is the genesis of these general convictions of mankind,
1132: so far as they depend on rational grounds; and this public property not
1133: only remains undisturbed, but is even raised to greater importance, by
1134: the doctrine that the schools have no right to arrogate to themselves a
1135: more profound insight into a matter of general human concernment than
1136: that to which the great mass of men, ever held by us in the highest
1137: estimation, can without difficulty attain, and that the schools should,
1138: therefore, confine themselves to the elaboration of these universally
1139: comprehensible and, from a moral point of view, amply satisfactory
1140: proofs. The change, therefore, affects only the arrogant pretensions of
1141: the schools, which would gladly retain, in their own exclusive
1142: possession, the key to the truths which they impart to the public.
1143: 
1144:  Quod mecum nescit, solus vult scire videri.
1145: 
1146: 
1147: At the same time it does not deprive the speculative philosopher of his
1148: just title to be the sole depositor of a science which benefits the
1149: public without its knowledge—I mean, the Critique of Pure Reason. This
1150: can never become popular and, indeed, has no occasion to be so; for
1151: finespun arguments in favour of useful truths make just as little
1152: impression on the public mind as the equally subtle objections brought
1153: against these truths. On the other hand, since both inevitably force
1154: themselves on every man who rises to the height of speculation, it
1155: becomes the manifest duty of the schools to enter upon a thorough
1156: investigation of the rights of speculative reason and, thus, to prevent
1157: the scandal which metaphysical controversies are sure, sooner or later,
1158: to cause even to the masses. It is only by criticism that
1159: metaphysicians (and, as such, theologians too) can be saved from these
1160: controversies and from the consequent perversion of their doctrines.
1161: Criticism alone can strike a blow at the root of materialism, fatalism,
1162: atheism, free-thinking, fanaticism, and superstition, which are
1163: universally injurious—as well as of idealism and scepticism, which are
1164: dangerous to the schools, but can scarcely pass over to the public. If
1165: governments think proper to interfere with the affairs of the learned,
1166: it would be more consistent with a wise regard for the interests of
1167: science, as well as for those of society, to favour a criticism of this
1168: kind, by which alone the labours of reason can be established on a firm
1169: basis, than to support the ridiculous despotism of the schools, which
1170: raise a loud cry of danger to the public over the destruction of
1171: cobwebs, of which the public has never taken any notice, and the loss
1172: of which, therefore, it can never feel.
1173: 
1174: This critical science is not opposed to the _dogmatic procedure_ of
1175: reason in pure cognition; for pure cognition must always be dogmatic,
1176: that is, must rest on strict demonstration from sure principles _à
1177: priori_—but to _dogmatism_, that is, to the presumption that it is
1178: possible to make any progress with a pure cognition, derived from
1179: (philosophical) conceptions, according to the principles which reason
1180: has long been in the habit of employing—without first inquiring in what
1181: way and by what right reason has come into the possession of these
1182: principles. Dogmatism is thus the dogmatic procedure of pure reason
1183: _without previous criticism of its own powers_, and in opposing this
1184: procedure, we must not be supposed to lend any countenance to that
1185: loquacious shallowness which arrogates to itself the name of
1186: popularity, nor yet to scepticism, which makes short work with the
1187: whole science of metaphysics. On the contrary, our criticism is the
1188: necessary preparation for a thoroughly scientific system of metaphysics
1189: which must perform its task entirely _à priori_, to the complete
1190: satisfaction of speculative reason, and must, therefore, be treated,
1191: not popularly, but scholastically. In carrying out the plan which the
1192: Critique prescribes, that is, in the future system of metaphysics, we
1193: must have recourse to the strict method of the celebrated WOLF, the
1194: greatest of all dogmatic philosophers. He was the first to point out
1195: the necessity of establishing fixed principles, of clearly defining our
1196: conceptions, and of subjecting our demonstrations to the most severe
1197: scrutiny, instead of rashly jumping at conclusions. The example which
1198: he set served to awaken that spirit of profound and thorough
1199: investigation which is not yet extinct in Germany. He would have been
1200: peculiarly well fitted to give a truly scientific character to
1201: metaphysical studies, had it occurred to him to prepare the field by a
1202: criticism of the _organum_, that is, of pure reason itself. That he
1203: failed to perceive the necessity of such a procedure must be ascribed
1204: to the dogmatic mode of thought which characterized his age, and on
1205: this point the philosophers of his time, as well as of all previous
1206: times, have nothing to reproach each other with. Those who reject at
1207: once the method of Wolf, and of the Critique of Pure Reason, can have
1208: no other aim but to shake off the fetters of _science_, to change
1209: labour into sport, certainty into opinion, and philosophy into
1210: philodoxy.
1211: 
1212: In this _second edition_, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to
1213: remove the difficulties and obscurity which, without fault of mine
1214: perhaps, have given rise to many misconceptions even among acute
1215: thinkers. In the propositions themselves, and in the demonstrations by
1216: which they are supported, as well as in the form and the entire plan of
1217: the work, I have found nothing to alter; which must be attributed
1218: partly to the long examination to which I had subjected the whole
1219: before offering it to the public and partly to the nature of the case.
1220: For pure speculative reason is an organic structure in which there is
1221: nothing isolated or independent, but every Single part is essential to
1222: all the rest; and hence, the slightest imperfection, whether defect or
1223: positive error, could not fail to betray itself in use. I venture,
1224: further, to hope, that this system will maintain the same unalterable
1225: character for the future. I am led to entertain this confidence, not by
1226: vanity, but by the evidence which the equality of the result affords,
1227: when we proceed, first, from the simplest elements up to the complete
1228: whole of pure reason and, and then, backwards from the whole to each
1229: part. We find that the attempt to make the slightest alteration, in any
1230: part, leads inevitably to contradictions, not merely in this system,
1231: but in human reason itself. At the same time, there is still much room
1232: for improvement in the _exposition_ of the doctrines contained in this
1233: work. In the present edition, I have endeavoured to remove
1234: misapprehensions of the æsthetical part, especially with regard to the
1235: conception of time; to clear away the obscurity which has been found in
1236: the deduction of the conceptions of the understanding; to supply the
1237: supposed want of sufficient evidence in the demonstration of the
1238: principles of the pure understanding; and, lastly, to obviate the
1239: misunderstanding of the paralogisms which immediately precede the
1240: Rational Psychology. Beyond this point—the end of the second main
1241: division of the “Transcendental Dialectic”—I have not extended my
1242: alterations,[8] partly from want of time, and partly because I am not
1243: aware that any portion of the remainder has given rise to
1244: misconceptions among intelligent and impartial critics, whom I do not
1245: here mention with that praise which is their due, but who will find
1246: that their suggestions have been attended to in the work itself.
1247: 
1248:  [8] The only addition, properly so called—and that only in the method
1249:  of proof—which I have made in the present edition, consists of a new
1250:  refutation of psychological _Idealism_, and a strict demonstration—the
1251:  only one possible, as I believe—of the objective reality of external
1252:  intuition. However harmless idealism may be considered—although in
1253:  reality it is not so—in regard to the essential ends of metaphysics,
1254:  it must still remain a scandal to philosophy and to the general human
1255:  reason to be obliged to assume, as an article of mere belief, the
1256:  existence of things external to ourselves (from which, yet, we derive
1257:  the whole material of cognition for the internal sense), and not to be
1258:  able to oppose a satisfactory proof to any one who may call it in
1259:  question. As there is some obscurity of expression in the
1260:  demonstration as it stands in the text, I propose to alter the passage
1261:  in question as follows: “But this permanent cannot be an intuition in
1262:  me. For all the determining grounds of my existence which can be found
1263:  in me are representations and, as such, do themselves require a
1264:  permanent, distinct from them, which may determine my existence in
1265:  relation to their changes, that is, my existence in time, wherein they
1266:  change.” It may, probably, be urged in opposition to this proof that,
1267:  after all, I am only conscious immediately of that which is in me,
1268:  that is, of my _representation_ of external things, and that,
1269:  consequently, it must always remain uncertain whether anything
1270:  corresponding to this representation does or does not exist externally
1271:  to me. But I am conscious, through internal _experience_, of my
1272:  _existence in time_ (consequently, also, of the determinability of the
1273:  former in the latter), and that is more than the simple consciousness
1274:  of my representation. It is, in fact, the same as the _empirical
1275:  consciousness of my existence_, which can only be determined in
1276:  relation to something, which, while connected with my existence, is
1277:  _external to me_. This consciousness of my existence in time is,
1278:  therefore, identical with the consciousness of a relation to something
1279:  external to me, and it is, therefore, experience, not fiction, sense,
1280:  not imagination, which inseparably connects the external with my
1281:  internal sense. For the external sense is, in itself, the relation of
1282:  intuition to something real, external to me; and the reality of this
1283:  something, as opposed to the mere imagination of it, rests solely on
1284:  its inseparable connection with internal experience as the condition
1285:  of its possibility. If with the _intellectual consciousness_ of my
1286:  existence, in the representation: _I am_, which accompanies all my
1287:  judgements, and all the operations of my understanding, I could, at
1288:  the same time, connect a determination of my existence by
1289:  _intellectual intuition_, then the consciousness of a relation to
1290:  something external to me would not be necessary. But the internal
1291:  intuition in which alone my existence can be determined, though
1292:  preceded by that purely intellectual consciousness, is itself sensible
1293:  and attached to the condition of time. Hence this determination of my
1294:  existence, and consequently my internal experience itself, must depend
1295:  on something permanent which is not in me, which can be, therefore,
1296:  only in something external to me, to which I must look upon myself as
1297:  being related. Thus the reality of the external sense is necessarily
1298:  connected with that of the internal, in order to the possibility of
1299:  experience in general; that is, I am just as certainly conscious that
1300:  there are things external to me related to my sense as I am that I
1301:  myself exist as determined in time. But in order to ascertain to what
1302:  given intuitions objects, external me, really correspond, in other
1303:  words, what intuitions belong to the external sense and not to
1304:  imagination, I must have recourse, in every particular case, to those
1305:  rules according to which experience in general (even internal
1306:  experience) is distinguished from imagination, and which are always
1307:  based on the proposition that there really is an external
1308:  experience.—We may add the remark that the representation of something
1309:  _permanent_ in existence, is not the same thing as the _permanent
1310:  representation;_ for a representation may be very variable and
1311:  changing—as all our representations, even that of matter, are—and yet
1312:  refer to something permanent, which must, therefore, be distinct from
1313:  all my representations and external to me, the existence of which is
1314:  necessarily included in the determination of my own existence, and
1315:  with it constitutes _one_ experience—an experience which would not
1316:  even be possible internally, if it were not also at the same time, in
1317:  part, external. To the question _How?_ we are no more able to reply,
1318:  than we are, in general, to think the stationary in time, the
1319:  coexistence of which with the variable, produces the conception of
1320:  change.
1321: 
1322: 
1323: In attempting to render the exposition of my views as intelligible as
1324: possible, I have been compelled to leave out or abridge various
1325: passages which were not essential to the completeness of the work, but
1326: which many readers might consider useful in other respects, and might
1327: be unwilling to miss. This trifling loss, which could not be avoided
1328: without swelling the book beyond due limits, may be supplied, at the
1329: pleasure of the reader, by a comparison with the first edition, and
1330: will, I hope, be more than compensated for by the greater clearness of
1331: the exposition as it now stands.
1332: 
1333: I have observed, with pleasure and thankfulness, in the pages of
1334: various reviews and treatises, that the spirit of profound and thorough
1335: investigation is not extinct in Germany, though it may have been
1336: overborne and silenced for a time by the fashionable tone of a licence
1337: in thinking, which gives itself the airs of genius, and that the
1338: difficulties which beset the paths of criticism have not prevented
1339: energetic and acute thinkers from making themselves masters of the
1340: science of pure reason to which these paths conduct—a science which is
1341: not popular, but scholastic in its character, and which alone can hope
1342: for a lasting existence or possess an abiding value. To these deserving
1343: men, who so happily combine profundity of view with a talent for lucid
1344: exposition—a talent which I myself am not conscious of possessing—I
1345: leave the task of removing any obscurity which may still adhere to the
1346: statement of my doctrines. For, in this case, the danger is not that of
1347: being refuted, but of being misunderstood. For my own part, I must
1348: henceforward abstain from controversy, although I shall carefully
1349: attend to all suggestions, whether from friends or adversaries, which
1350: may be of use in the future elaboration of the system of this
1351: Propædeutic. As, during these labours, I have advanced pretty far in
1352: years this month I reach my sixty-fourth year—it will be necessary for
1353: me to economize time, if I am to carry out my plan of elaborating the
1354: metaphysics of nature as well as of morals, in confirmation of the
1355: correctness of the principles established in this Critique of Pure
1356: Reason, both speculative and practical; and I must, therefore, leave
1357: the task of clearing up the obscurities of the present work—inevitable,
1358: perhaps, at the outset—as well as, the defence of the whole, to those
1359: deserving men, who have made my system their own. A philosophical
1360: system cannot come forward armed at all points like a mathematical
1361: treatise, and hence it may be quite possible to take objection to
1362: particular passages, while the organic structure of the system,
1363: considered as a unity, has no danger to apprehend. But few possess the
1364: ability, and still fewer the inclination, to take a comprehensive view
1365: of a new system. By confining the view to particular passages, taking
1366: these out of their connection and comparing them with one another, it
1367: is easy to pick out apparent contradictions, especially in a work
1368: written with any freedom of style. These contradictions place the work
1369: in an unfavourable light in the eyes of those who rely on the judgement
1370: of others, but are easily reconciled by those who have mastered the
1371: idea of the whole. If a theory possesses stability in itself, the
1372: action and reaction which seemed at first to threaten its existence
1373: serve only, in the course of time, to smooth down any superficial
1374: roughness or inequality, and—if men of insight, impartiality, and truly
1375: popular gifts, turn their attention to it—to secure to it, in a short
1376: time, the requisite elegance also.

1382: 
1383: Introduction
1384: 
1385: I. Of the difference between Pure and Empirical Knowledge
1386: 
1387: 
1388: That all our knowledge begins with experience there can be no doubt.
1389: For how is it possible that the faculty of cognition should be awakened
1390: into exercise otherwise than by means of objects which affect our
1391: senses, and partly of themselves produce representations, partly rouse
1392: our powers of understanding into activity, to compare to connect, or to
1393: separate these, and so to convert the raw material of our sensuous
1394: impressions into a knowledge of objects, which is called experience? In
1395: respect of time, therefore, no knowledge of ours is antecedent to
1396: experience, but begins with it.
1397: 
1398: But, though all our knowledge begins with experience, it by no means
1399: follows that all arises out of experience. For, on the contrary, it is
1400: quite possible that our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which
1401: we receive through impressions, and that which the faculty of cognition
1402: supplies from itself (sensuous impressions giving merely the occasion),
1403: an addition which we cannot distinguish from the original element given
1404: by sense, till long practice has made us attentive to, and skilful in
1405: separating it. It is, therefore, a question which requires close
1406: investigation, and not to be answered at first sight, whether there
1407: exists a knowledge altogether independent of experience, and even of
1408: all sensuous impressions? Knowledge of this kind is called à priori, in
1409: contradistinction to empirical knowledge, which has its sources à
1410: posteriori, that is, in experience.
1411: 
1412: But the expression, “à priori,” is not as yet definite enough
1413: adequately to indicate the whole meaning of the question above started.
1414: For, in speaking of knowledge which has its sources in experience, we
1415: are wont to say, that this or that may be known à priori, because we do
1416: not derive this knowledge immediately from experience, but from a
1417: general rule, which, however, we have itself borrowed from experience.
1418: Thus, if a man undermined his house, we say, “he might know à priori
1419: that it would have fallen;” that is, he needed not to have waited for
1420: the experience that it did actually fall. But still, à priori, he could
1421: not know even this much. For, that bodies are heavy, and, consequently,
1422: that they fall when their supports are taken away, must have been known
1423: to him previously, by means of experience.
1424: 
1425: By the term “knowledge à priori,” therefore, we shall in the sequel
1426: understand, not such as is independent of this or that kind of
1427: experience, but such as is absolutely so of all experience. Opposed to
1428: this is empirical knowledge, or that which is possible only à
1429: posteriori, that is, through experience. Knowledge à priori is either
1430: pure or impure. Pure knowledge à priori is that with which no empirical
1431: element is mixed up. For example, the proposition, “Every change has a
1432: cause,” is a proposition à priori, but impure, because change is a
1433: conception which can only be derived from experience.
1434: 
1435: II. The Human Intellect, even in an Unphilosophical State, is in
1436: Possession of Certain Cognitions “à priori”.
1437: 
1438: The question now is as to a criterion, by which we may securely
1439: distinguish a pure from an empirical cognition. Experience no doubt
1440: teaches us that this or that object is constituted in such and such a
1441: manner, but not that it could not possibly exist otherwise. Now, in the
1442: first place, if we have a proposition which contains the idea of
1443: necessity in its very conception, it is priori. If, moreover, it is not
1444: derived from any other proposition, unless from one equally involving
1445: the idea of necessity, it is absolutely priori. Secondly, an empirical
1446: judgement never exhibits strict and absolute, but only assumed and
1447: comparative universality (by induction); therefore, the most we can say
1448: is—so far as we have hitherto observed, there is no exception to this
1449: or that rule. If, on the other hand, a judgement carries with it strict
1450: and absolute universality, that is, admits of no possible exception, it
1451: is not derived from experience, but is valid absolutely à priori.
1452: 
1453: Empirical universality is, therefore, only an arbitrary extension of
1454: validity, from that which may be predicated of a proposition valid in
1455: most cases, to that which is asserted of a proposition which holds good
1456: in all; as, for example, in the affirmation, “All bodies are heavy.”
1457: When, on the contrary, strict universality characterizes a judgement,
1458: it necessarily indicates another peculiar source of knowledge, namely,
1459: a faculty of cognition à priori. Necessity and strict universality,
1460: therefore, are infallible tests for distinguishing pure from empirical
1461: knowledge, and are inseparably connected with each other. But as in the
1462: use of these criteria the empirical limitation is sometimes more easily
1463: detected than the contingency of the judgement, or the unlimited
1464: universality which we attach to a judgement is often a more convincing
1465: proof than its necessity, it may be advisable to use the criteria
1466: separately, each being by itself infallible.
1467: 
1468: Now, that in the sphere of human cognition we have judgements which are
1469: necessary, and in the strictest sense universal, consequently pure à
1470: priori, it will be an easy matter to show. If we desire an example from
1471: the sciences, we need only take any proposition in mathematics. If we
1472: cast our eyes upon the commonest operations of the understanding, the
1473: proposition, “Every change must have a cause,” will amply serve our
1474: purpose. In the latter case, indeed, the conception of a cause so
1475: plainly involves the conception of a necessity of connection with an
1476: effect, and of a strict universality of the law, that the very notion
1477: of a cause would entirely disappear, were we to derive it, like Hume,
1478: from a frequent association of what happens with that which precedes;
1479: and the habit thence originating of connecting representations—the
1480: necessity inherent in the judgement being therefore merely subjective.
1481: Besides, without seeking for such examples of principles existing à
1482: priori in cognition, we might easily show that such principles are the
1483: indispensable basis of the possibility of experience itself, and
1484: consequently prove their existence à priori. For whence could our
1485: experience itself acquire certainty, if all the rules on which it
1486: depends were themselves empirical, and consequently fortuitous? No one,
1487: therefore, can admit the validity of the use of such rules as first
1488: principles. But, for the present, we may content ourselves with having
1489: established the fact, that we do possess and exercise a faculty of pure
1490: à priori cognition; and, secondly, with having pointed out the proper
1491: tests of such cognition, namely, universality and necessity.
1492: 
1493: Not only in judgements, however, but even in conceptions, is an à
1494: priori origin manifest. For example, if we take away by degrees from
1495: our conceptions of a body all that can be referred to mere sensuous
1496: experience—colour, hardness or softness, weight, even
1497: impenetrability—the body will then vanish; but the space which it
1498: occupied still remains, and this it is utterly impossible to annihilate
1499: in thought. Again, if we take away, in like manner, from our empirical
1500: conception of any object, corporeal or incorporeal, all properties
1501: which mere experience has taught us to connect with it, still we cannot
1502: think away those through which we cogitate it as substance, or adhering
1503: to substance, although our conception of substance is more determined
1504: than that of an object. Compelled, therefore, by that necessity with
1505: which the conception of substance forces itself upon us, we must
1506: confess that it has its seat in our faculty of cognition à priori.
1507: 
1508: III. Philosophy stands in need of a Science which shall Determine the
1509: Possibility, Principles, and Extent of Human Knowledge “à priori”
1510: 
1511: Of far more importance than all that has been above said, is the
1512: consideration that certain of our cognitions rise completely above the
1513: sphere of all possible experience, and by means of conceptions, to
1514: which there exists in the whole extent of experience no corresponding
1515: object, seem to extend the range of our judgements beyond its bounds.
1516: And just in this transcendental or supersensible sphere, where
1517: experience affords us neither instruction nor guidance, lie the
1518: investigations of reason, which, on account of their importance, we
1519: consider far preferable to, and as having a far more elevated aim than,
1520: all that the understanding can achieve within the sphere of sensuous
1521: phenomena. So high a value do we set upon these investigations, that
1522: even at the risk of error, we persist in following them out, and permit
1523: neither doubt nor disregard nor indifference to restrain us from the
1524: pursuit. These unavoidable problems of mere pure reason are God,
1525: freedom (of will), and immortality. The science which, with all its
1526: preliminaries, has for its especial object the solution of these
1527: problems is named metaphysics—a science which is at the very outset
1528: dogmatical, that is, it confidently takes upon itself the execution of
1529: this task without any previous investigation of the ability or
1530: inability of reason for such an undertaking.
1531: 
1532: Now the safe ground of experience being thus abandoned, it seems
1533: nevertheless natural that we should hesitate to erect a building with
1534: the cognitions we possess, without knowing whence they come, and on the
1535: strength of principles, the origin of which is undiscovered. Instead of
1536: thus trying to build without a foundation, it is rather to be expected
1537: that we should long ago have put the question, how the understanding
1538: can arrive at these à priori cognitions, and what is the extent,
1539: validity, and worth which they may possess? We say, “This is natural
1540: enough,” meaning by the word natural, that which is consistent with a
1541: just and reasonable way of thinking; but if we understand by the term,
1542: that which usually happens, nothing indeed could be more natural and
1543: more comprehensible than that this investigation should be left long
1544: unattempted. For one part of our pure knowledge, the science of
1545: mathematics, has been long firmly established, and thus leads us to
1546: form flattering expectations with regard to others, though these may be
1547: of quite a different nature. Besides, when we get beyond the bounds of
1548: experience, we are of course safe from opposition in that quarter; and
1549: the charm of widening the range of our knowledge is so great that,
1550: unless we are brought to a standstill by some evident contradiction, we
1551: hurry on undoubtingly in our course. This, however, may be avoided, if
1552: we are sufficiently cautious in the construction of our fictions, which
1553: are not the less fictions on that account.
1554: 
1555: Mathematical science affords us a brilliant example, how far,
1556: independently of all experience, we may carry our à priori knowledge.
1557: It is true that the mathematician occupies himself with objects and
1558: cognitions only in so far as they can be represented by means of
1559: intuition. But this circumstance is easily overlooked, because the said
1560: intuition can itself be given à priori, and therefore is hardly to be
1561: distinguished from a mere pure conception. Deceived by such a proof of
1562: the power of reason, we can perceive no limits to the extension of our
1563: knowledge. The light dove cleaving in free flight the thin air, whose
1564: resistance it feels, might imagine that her movements would be far more
1565: free and rapid in airless space. Just in the same way did Plato,
1566: abandoning the world of sense because of the narrow limits it sets to
1567: the understanding, venture upon the wings of ideas beyond it, into the
1568: void space of pure intellect. He did not reflect that he made no real
1569: progress by all his efforts; for he met with no resistance which might
1570: serve him for a support, as it were, whereon to rest, and on which he
1571: might apply his powers, in order to let the intellect acquire momentum
1572: for its progress. It is, indeed, the common fate of human reason in
1573: speculation, to finish the imposing edifice of thought as rapidly as
1574: possible, and then for the first time to begin to examine whether the
1575: foundation is a solid one or no. Arrived at this point, all sorts of
1576: excuses are sought after, in order to console us for its want of
1577: stability, or rather, indeed, to enable Us to dispense altogether with
1578: so late and dangerous an investigation. But what frees us during the
1579: process of building from all apprehension or suspicion, and flatters us
1580: into the belief of its solidity, is this. A great part, perhaps the
1581: greatest part, of the business of our reason consists in the
1582: analysation of the conceptions which we already possess of objects. By
1583: this means we gain a multitude of cognitions, which although really
1584: nothing more than elucidations or explanations of that which (though in
1585: a confused manner) was already thought in our conceptions, are, at
1586: least in respect of their form, prized as new introspections; whilst,
1587: so far as regards their matter or content, we have really made no
1588: addition to our conceptions, but only disinvolved them. But as this
1589: process does furnish a real priori knowledge, which has a sure progress
1590: and useful results, reason, deceived by this, slips in, without being
1591: itself aware of it, assertions of a quite different kind; in which, to
1592: given conceptions it adds others, à priori indeed, but entirely foreign
1593: to them, without our knowing how it arrives at these, and, indeed,
1594: without such a question ever suggesting itself. I shall therefore at
1595: once proceed to examine the difference between these two modes of
1596: knowledge.
1597: 
1598: IV. Of the Difference Between Analytical and Synthetical Judgements.
1599: 
1600: In all judgements wherein the relation of a subject to the predicate is
1601: cogitated (I mention affirmative judgements only here; the application
1602: to negative will be very easy), this relation is possible in two
1603: different ways. Either the predicate B belongs to the subject A, as
1604: somewhat which is contained (though covertly) in the conception A; or
1605: the predicate B lies completely out of the conception A, although it
1606: stands in connection with it. In the first instance, I term the
1607: judgement analytical, in the second, synthetical. Analytical judgements
1608: (affirmative) are therefore those in which the connection of the
1609: predicate with the subject is cogitated through identity; those in
1610: which this connection is cogitated without identity, are called
1611: synthetical judgements. The former may be called explicative, the
1612: latter augmentative judgements; because the former add in the predicate
1613: nothing to the conception of the subject, but only analyse it into its
1614: constituent conceptions, which were thought already in the subject,
1615: although in a confused manner; the latter add to our conceptions of the
1616: subject a predicate which was not contained in it, and which no
1617: analysis could ever have discovered therein. For example, when I say,
1618: “All bodies are extended,” this is an analytical judgement. For I need
1619: not go beyond the conception of body in order to find extension
1620: connected with it, but merely analyse the conception, that is, become
1621: conscious of the manifold properties which I think in that conception,
1622: in order to discover this predicate in it: it is therefore an
1623: analytical judgement. On the other hand, when I say, “All bodies are
1624: heavy,” the predicate is something totally different from that which I
1625: think in the mere conception of a body. By the addition of such a
1626: predicate, therefore, it becomes a synthetical judgement.
1627: 
1628: Judgements of experience, as such, are always synthetical. For it would
1629: be absurd to think of grounding an analytical judgement on experience,
1630: because in forming such a judgement I need not go out of the sphere of
1631: my conceptions, and therefore recourse to the testimony of experience
1632: is quite unnecessary. That “bodies are extended” is not an empirical
1633: judgement, but a proposition which stands firm à priori. For before
1634: addressing myself to experience, I already have in my conception all
1635: the requisite conditions for the judgement, and I have only to extract
1636: the predicate from the conception, according to the principle of
1637: contradiction, and thereby at the same time become conscious of the
1638: necessity of the judgement, a necessity which I could never learn from
1639: experience. On the other hand, though at first I do not at all include
1640: the predicate of weight in my conception of body in general, that
1641: conception still indicates an object of experience, a part of the
1642: totality of experience, to which I can still add other parts; and this
1643: I do when I recognize by observation that bodies are heavy. I can
1644: cognize beforehand by analysis the conception of body through the
1645: characteristics of extension, impenetrability, shape, etc., all which
1646: are cogitated in this conception. But now I extend my knowledge, and
1647: looking back on experience from which I had derived this conception of
1648: body, I find weight at all times connected with the above
1649: characteristics, and therefore I synthetically add to my conceptions
1650: this as a predicate, and say, “All bodies are heavy.” Thus it is
1651: experience upon which rests the possibility of the synthesis of the
1652: predicate of weight with the conception of body, because both
1653: conceptions, although the one is not contained in the other, still
1654: belong to one another (only contingently, however), as parts of a
1655: whole, namely, of experience, which is itself a synthesis of
1656: intuitions.
1657: 
1658: But to synthetical judgements à priori, such aid is entirely wanting.
1659: If I go out of and beyond the conception A, in order to recognize
1660: another B as connected with it, what foundation have I to rest on,
1661: whereby to render the synthesis possible? I have here no longer the
1662: advantage of looking out in the sphere of experience for what I want.
1663: Let us take, for example, the proposition, “Everything that happens has
1664: a cause.” In the conception of “something that happens,” I indeed think
1665: an existence which a certain time antecedes, and from this I can derive
1666: analytical judgements. But the conception of a cause lies quite out of
1667: the above conception, and indicates something entirely different from
1668: “that which happens,” and is consequently not contained in that
1669: conception. How then am I able to assert concerning the general
1670: conception—“that which happens”—something entirely different from that
1671: conception, and to recognize the conception of cause although not
1672: contained in it, yet as belonging to it, and even necessarily? what is
1673: here the unknown = X, upon which the understanding rests when it
1674: believes it has found, out of the conception A a foreign predicate B,
1675: which it nevertheless considers to be connected with it? It cannot be
1676: experience, because the principle adduced annexes the two
1677: representations, cause and effect, to the representation existence, not
1678: only with universality, which experience cannot give, but also with the
1679: expression of necessity, therefore completely à priori and from pure
1680: conceptions. Upon such synthetical, that is augmentative propositions,
1681: depends the whole aim of our speculative knowledge à priori; for
1682: although analytical judgements are indeed highly important and
1683: necessary, they are so, only to arrive at that clearness of conceptions
1684: which is requisite for a sure and extended synthesis, and this alone is
1685: a real acquisition.
1686: 
1687: V. In all Theoretical Sciences of Reason, Synthetical Judgements “à
1688: priori” are contained as Principles.
1689: 
1690: 1. Mathematical judgements are always synthetical. Hitherto this fact,
1691: though incontestably true and very important in its consequences, seems
1692: to have escaped the analysts of the human mind, nay, to be in complete
1693: opposition to all their conjectures. For as it was found that
1694: mathematical conclusions all proceed according to the principle of
1695: contradiction (which the nature of every apodeictic certainty
1696: requires), people became persuaded that the fundamental principles of
1697: the science also were recognized and admitted in the same way. But the
1698: notion is fallacious; for although a synthetical proposition can
1699: certainly be discerned by means of the principle of contradiction, this
1700: is possible only when another synthetical proposition precedes, from
1701: which the latter is deduced, but never of itself.
1702: 
1703: Before all, be it observed, that proper mathematical propositions are
1704: always judgements à priori, and not empirical, because they carry along
1705: with them the conception of necessity, which cannot be given by
1706: experience. If this be demurred to, it matters not; I will then limit
1707: my assertion to pure mathematics, the very conception of which implies
1708: that it consists of knowledge altogether non-empirical and à priori.
1709: 
1710: We might, indeed at first suppose that the proposition 7 + 5 = 12 is a
1711: merely analytical proposition, following (according to the principle of
1712: contradiction) from the conception of a sum of seven and five. But if
1713: we regard it more narrowly, we find that our conception of the sum of
1714: seven and five contains nothing more than the uniting of both sums into
1715: one, whereby it cannot at all be cogitated what this single number is
1716: which embraces both. The conception of twelve is by no means obtained
1717: by merely cogitating the union of seven and five; and we may analyse
1718: our conception of such a possible sum as long as we will, still we
1719: shall never discover in it the notion of twelve. We must go beyond
1720: these conceptions, and have recourse to an intuition which corresponds
1721: to one of the two—our five fingers, for example, or like Segner in his
1722: Arithmetic five points, and so by degrees, add the units contained in
1723: the five given in the intuition, to the conception of seven. For I
1724: first take the number 7, and, for the conception of 5 calling in the
1725: aid of the fingers of my hand as objects of intuition, I add the units,
1726: which I before took together to make up the number 5, gradually now by
1727: means of the material image my hand, to the number 7, and by this
1728: process, I at length see the number 12 arise. That 7 should be added to
1729: 5, I have certainly cogitated in my conception of a sum = 7 + 5, but
1730: not that this sum was equal to 12. Arithmetical propositions are
1731: therefore always synthetical, of which we may become more clearly
1732: convinced by trying large numbers. For it will thus become quite
1733: evident that, turn and twist our conceptions as we may, it is
1734: impossible, without having recourse to intuition, to arrive at the sum
1735: total or product by means of the mere analysis of our conceptions. Just
1736: as little is any principle of pure geometry analytical. “A straight
1737: line between two points is the shortest,” is a synthetical proposition.
1738: For my conception of straight contains no notion of quantity, but is
1739: merely qualitative. The conception of the shortest is therefore fore
1740: wholly an addition, and by no analysis can it be extracted from our
1741: conception of a straight line. Intuition must therefore here lend its
1742: aid, by means of which, and thus only, our synthesis is possible.
1743: 
1744: Some few principles preposited by geometricians are, indeed, really
1745: analytical, and depend on the principle of contradiction. They serve,
1746: however, like identical propositions, as links in the chain of method,
1747: not as principles—for example, a = a, the whole is equal to itself, or
1748: (a+b) —> a, the whole is greater than its part. And yet even these
1749: principles themselves, though they derive their validity from pure
1750: conceptions, are only admitted in mathematics because they can be
1751: presented in intuition. What causes us here commonly to believe that
1752: the predicate of such apodeictic judgements is already contained in our
1753: conception, and that the judgement is therefore analytical, is merely
1754: the equivocal nature of the expression. We must join in thought a
1755: certain predicate to a given conception, and this necessity cleaves
1756: already to the conception. But the question is, not what we must join
1757: in thought to the given conception, but what we really think therein,
1758: though only obscurely, and then it becomes manifest that the predicate
1759: pertains to these conceptions, necessarily indeed, yet not as thought
1760: in the conception itself, but by virtue of an intuition, which must be
1761: added to the conception.
1762: 
1763: 2. The science of natural philosophy (physics) contains in itself
1764: synthetical judgements à priori, as principles. I shall adduce two
1765: propositions. For instance, the proposition, “In all changes of the
1766: material world, the quantity of matter remains unchanged”; or, that,
1767: “In all communication of motion, action and reaction must always be
1768: equal.” In both of these, not only is the necessity, and therefore
1769: their origin à priori clear, but also that they are synthetical
1770: propositions. For in the conception of matter, I do not cogitate its
1771: permanency, but merely its presence in space, which it fills. I
1772: therefore really go out of and beyond the conception of matter, in
1773: order to think on to it something à priori, which I did not think in
1774: it. The proposition is therefore not analytical, but synthetical, and
1775: nevertheless conceived à priori; and so it is with regard to the other
1776: propositions of the pure part of natural philosophy.
1777: 
1778: 3. As to metaphysics, even if we look upon it merely as an attempted
1779: science, yet, from the nature of human reason, an indispensable one, we
1780: find that it must contain synthetical propositions à priori. It is not
1781: merely the duty of metaphysics to dissect, and thereby analytically to
1782: illustrate the conceptions which we form à priori of things; but we
1783: seek to widen the range of our à priori knowledge. For this purpose, we
1784: must avail ourselves of such principles as add something to the
1785: original conception—something not identical with, nor contained in it,
1786: and by means of synthetical judgements à priori, leave far behind us
1787: the limits of experience; for example, in the proposition, “the world
1788: must have a beginning,” and such like. Thus metaphysics, according to
1789: the proper aim of the science, consists merely of synthetical
1790: propositions à priori.
1791: 
1792: VI. The Universal Problem of Pure Reason.
1793: 
1794: It is extremely advantageous to be able to bring a number of
1795: investigations under the formula of a single problem. For in this
1796: manner, we not only facilitate our own labour, inasmuch as we define it
1797: clearly to ourselves, but also render it more easy for others to decide
1798: whether we have done justice to our undertaking. The proper problem of
1799: pure reason, then, is contained in the question: “How are synthetical
1800: judgements à priori possible?”
1801: 
1802: That metaphysical science has hitherto remained in so vacillating a
1803: state of uncertainty and contradiction, is only to be attributed to the
1804: fact that this great problem, and perhaps even the difference between
1805: analytical and synthetical judgements, did not sooner suggest itself to
1806: philosophers. Upon the solution of this problem, or upon sufficient
1807: proof of the impossibility of synthetical knowledge à priori, depends
1808: the existence or downfall of the science of metaphysics. Among
1809: philosophers, David Hume came the nearest of all to this problem; yet
1810: it never acquired in his mind sufficient precision, nor did he regard
1811: the question in its universality. On the contrary, he stopped short at
1812: the synthetical proposition of the connection of an effect with its
1813: cause (principium causalitatis), insisting that such proposition à
1814: priori was impossible. According to his conclusions, then, all that we
1815: term metaphysical science is a mere delusion, arising from the fancied
1816: insight of reason into that which is in truth borrowed from experience,
1817: and to which habit has given the appearance of necessity. Against this
1818: assertion, destructive to all pure philosophy, he would have been
1819: guarded, had he had our problem before his eyes in its universality.
1820: For he would then have perceived that, according to his own argument,
1821: there likewise could not be any pure mathematical science, which
1822: assuredly cannot exist without synthetical propositions à priori—an
1823: absurdity from which his good understanding must have saved him.
1824: 
1825: In the solution of the above problem is at the same time comprehended
1826: the possibility of the use of pure reason in the foundation and
1827: construction of all sciences which contain theoretical knowledge à
1828: priori of objects, that is to say, the answer to the following
1829: questions:
1830: 
1831: How is pure mathematical science possible?
1832: 
1833: How is pure natural science possible?
1834: 
1835: Respecting these sciences, as they do certainly exist, it may with
1836: propriety be asked, how they are possible?—for that they must be
1837: possible is shown by the fact of their really existing.[9] But as to
1838: metaphysics, the miserable progress it has hitherto made, and the fact
1839: that of no one system yet brought forward, far as regards its true aim,
1840: can it be said that this science really exists, leaves any one at
1841: liberty to doubt with reason the very possibility of its existence.
1842: 
1843:  [9] As to the existence of pure natural science, or physics, perhaps
1844:  many may still express doubts. But we have only to look at the
1845:  different propositions which are commonly treated of at the
1846:  commencement of proper (empirical) physical science—those, for
1847:  example, relating to the permanence of the same quantity of matter,
1848:  the vis inertiae, the equality of action and reaction, etc.—to be soon
1849:  convinced that they form a science of pure physics (physica pura, or
1850:  rationalis), which well deserves to be separately exposed as a special
1851:  science, in its whole extent, whether that be great or confined.
1852: 
1853: 
1854: Yet, in a certain sense, this kind of knowledge must unquestionably be
1855: looked upon as given; in other words, metaphysics must be considered as
1856: really existing, if not as a science, nevertheless as a natural
1857: disposition of the human mind (metaphysica naturalis). For human
1858: reason, without any instigations imputable to the mere vanity of great
1859: knowledge, unceasingly progresses, urged on by its own feeling of need,
1860: towards such questions as cannot be answered by any empirical
1861: application of reason, or principles derived therefrom; and so there
1862: has ever really existed in every man some system of metaphysics. It
1863: will always exist, so soon as reason awakes to the exercise of its
1864: power of speculation. And now the question arises: “How is metaphysics,
1865: as a natural disposition, possible?” In other words, how, from the
1866: nature of universal human reason, do those questions arise which pure
1867: reason proposes to itself, and which it is impelled by its own feeling
1868: of need to answer as well as it can?
1869: 
1870: But as in all the attempts hitherto made to answer the questions which
1871: reason is prompted by its very nature to propose to itself, for
1872: example, whether the world had a beginning, or has existed from
1873: eternity, it has always met with unavoidable contradictions, we must
1874: not rest satisfied with the mere natural disposition of the mind to
1875: metaphysics, that is, with the existence of the faculty of pure reason,
1876: whence, indeed, some sort of metaphysical system always arises; but it
1877: must be possible to arrive at certainty in regard to the question
1878: whether we know or do not know the things of which metaphysics treats.
1879: We must be able to arrive at a decision on the subjects of its
1880: questions, or on the ability or inability of reason to form any
1881: judgement respecting them; and therefore either to extend with
1882: confidence the bounds of our pure reason, or to set strictly defined
1883: and safe limits to its action. This last question, which arises out of
1884: the above universal problem, would properly run thus: “How is
1885: metaphysics possible as a science?”
1886: 
1887: Thus, the critique of reason leads at last, naturally and necessarily,
1888: to science; and, on the other hand, the dogmatical use of reason
1889: without criticism leads to groundless assertions, against which others
1890: equally specious can always be set, thus ending unavoidably in
1891: scepticism.
1892: 
1893: Besides, this science cannot be of great and formidable prolixity,
1894: because it has not to do with objects of reason, the variety of which
1895: is inexhaustible, but merely with Reason herself and her problems;
1896: problems which arise out of her own bosom, and are not proposed to her
1897: by the nature of outward things, but by her own nature. And when once
1898: Reason has previously become able completely to understand her own
1899: power in regard to objects which she meets with in experience, it will
1900: be easy to determine securely the extent and limits of her attempted
1901: application to objects beyond the confines of experience.
1902: 
1903: We may and must, therefore, regard the attempts hitherto made to
1904: establish metaphysical science dogmatically as non-existent. For what
1905: of analysis, that is, mere dissection of conceptions, is contained in
1906: one or other, is not the aim of, but only a preparation for metaphysics
1907: proper, which has for its object the extension, by means of synthesis,
1908: of our à priori knowledge. And for this purpose, mere analysis is of
1909: course useless, because it only shows what is contained in these
1910: conceptions, but not how we arrive, à priori, at them; and this it is
1911: her duty to show, in order to be able afterwards to determine their
1912: valid use in regard to all objects of experience, to all knowledge in
1913: general. But little self-denial, indeed, is needed to give up these
1914: pretensions, seeing the undeniable, and in the dogmatic mode of
1915: procedure, inevitable contradictions of Reason with herself, have long
1916: since ruined the reputation of every system of metaphysics that has
1917: appeared up to this time. It will require more firmness to remain
1918: undeterred by difficulty from within, and opposition from without, from
1919: endeavouring, by a method quite opposed to all those hitherto followed,
1920: to further the growth and fruitfulness of a science indispensable to
1921: human reason—a science from which every branch it has borne may be cut
1922: away, but whose roots remain indestructible.
1923: 
1924: VII. Idea and Division of a Particular Science, under the Name of a
1925: Critique of Pure Reason.
1926: 
1927: From all that has been said, there results the idea of a particular
1928: science, which may be called the Critique of Pure Reason. For reason is
1929: the faculty which furnishes us with the principles of knowledge à
1930: priori. Hence, pure reason is the faculty which contains the principles
1931: of cognizing anything absolutely à priori. An organon of pure reason
1932: would be a compendium of those principles according to which alone all
1933: pure cognitions à priori can be obtained. The completely extended
1934: application of such an organon would afford us a system of pure reason.
1935: As this, however, is demanding a great deal, and it is yet doubtful
1936: whether any extension of our knowledge be here possible, or, if so, in
1937: what cases; we can regard a science of the mere criticism of pure
1938: reason, its sources and limits, as the propædeutic to a system of pure
1939: reason. Such a science must not be called a doctrine, but only a
1940: critique of pure reason; and its use, in regard to speculation, would
1941: be only negative, not to enlarge the bounds of, but to purify, our
1942: reason, and to shield it against error—which alone is no little gain. I
1943: apply the term transcendental to all knowledge which is not so much
1944: occupied with objects as with the mode of our cognition of these
1945: objects, so far as this mode of cognition is possible à priori. A
1946: system of such conceptions would be called transcendental philosophy.
1947: But this, again, is still beyond the bounds of our present essay. For
1948: as such a science must contain a complete exposition not only of our
1949: synthetical à priori, but of our analytical à priori knowledge, it is
1950: of too wide a range for our present purpose, because we do not require
1951: to carry our analysis any farther than is necessary to understand, in
1952: their full extent, the principles of synthesis à priori, with which
1953: alone we have to do. This investigation, which we cannot properly call
1954: a doctrine, but only a transcendental critique, because it aims not at
1955: the enlargement, but at the correction and guidance, of our knowledge,
1956: and is to serve as a touchstone of the worth or worthlessness of all
1957: knowledge à priori, is the sole object of our present essay. Such a
1958: critique is consequently, as far as possible, a preparation for an
1959: organon; and if this new organon should be found to fail, at least for
1960: a canon of pure reason, according to which the complete system of the
1961: philosophy of pure reason, whether it extend or limit the bounds of
1962: that reason, might one day be set forth both analytically and
1963: synthetically. For that this is possible, nay, that such a system is
1964: not of so great extent as to preclude the hope of its ever being
1965: completed, is evident. For we have not here to do with the nature of
1966: outward objects, which is infinite, but solely with the mind, which
1967: judges of the nature of objects, and, again, with the mind only in
1968: respect of its cognition à priori. And the object of our
1969: investigations, as it is not to be sought without, but, altogether
1970: within, ourselves, cannot remain concealed, and in all probability is
1971: limited enough to be completely surveyed and fairly estimated,
1972: according to its worth or worthlessness. Still less let the reader here
1973: expect a critique of books and systems of pure reason; our present
1974: object is exclusively a critique of the faculty of pure reason itself.
1975: Only when we make this critique our foundation, do we possess a pure
1976: touchstone for estimating the philosophical value of ancient and modern
1977: writings on this subject; and without this criterion, the incompetent
1978: historian or judge decides upon and corrects the groundless assertions
1979: of others with his own, which have themselves just as little
1980: foundation.
1981: 
1982: Transcendental philosophy is the idea of a science, for which the
1983: Critique of Pure Reason must sketch the whole plan architectonically,
1984: that is, from principles, with a full guarantee for the validity and
1985: stability of all the parts which enter into the building. It is the
1986: system of all the principles of pure reason. If this Critique itself
1987: does not assume the title of transcendental philosophy, it is only
1988: because, to be a complete system, it ought to contain a full analysis
1989: of all human knowledge à priori. Our critique must, indeed, lay before
1990: us a complete enumeration of all the radical conceptions which
1991: constitute the said pure knowledge. But from the complete analysis of
1992: these conceptions themselves, as also from a complete investigation of
1993: those derived from them, it abstains with reason; partly because it
1994: would be deviating from the end in view to occupy itself with this
1995: analysis, since this process is not attended with the difficulty and
1996: insecurity to be found in the synthesis, to which our critique is
1997: entirely devoted, and partly because it would be inconsistent with the
1998: unity of our plan to burden this essay with the vindication of the
1999: completeness of such an analysis and deduction, with which, after all,
2000: we have at present nothing to do. This completeness of the analysis of
2001: these radical conceptions, as well as of the deduction from the
2002: conceptions à priori which may be given by the analysis, we can,
2003: however, easily attain, provided only that we are in possession of all
2004: these radical conceptions, which are to serve as principles of the
2005: synthesis, and that in respect of this main purpose nothing is wanting.
2006: 
2007: To the Critique of Pure Reason, therefore, belongs all that constitutes
2008: transcendental philosophy; and it is the complete idea of
2009: transcendental philosophy, but still not the science itself; because it
2010: only proceeds so far with the analysis as is necessary to the power of
2011: judging completely of our synthetical knowledge à priori.
2012: 
2013: The principal thing we must attend to, in the division of the parts of
2014: a science like this, is that no conceptions must enter it which contain
2015: aught empirical; in other words, that the knowledge à priori must be
2016: completely pure. Hence, although the highest principles and fundamental
2017: conceptions of morality are certainly cognitions à priori, yet they do
2018: not belong to transcendental philosophy; because, though they certainly
2019: do not lay the conceptions of pain, pleasure, desires, inclinations,
2020: etc. (which are all of empirical origin), at the foundation of its
2021: precepts, yet still into the conception of duty—as an obstacle to be
2022: overcome, or as an incitement which should not be made into a
2023: motive—these empirical conceptions must necessarily enter, in the
2024: construction of a system of pure morality. Transcendental philosophy is
2025: consequently a philosophy of the pure and merely speculative reason.
2026: For all that is practical, so far as it contains motives, relates to
2027: feelings, and these belong to empirical sources of cognition.
2028: 
2029: If we wish to divide this science from the universal point of view of a
2030: science in general, it ought to comprehend, first, a Doctrine of the
2031: Elements, and, secondly, a Doctrine of the Method of pure reason. Each
2032: of these main divisions will have its subdivisions, the separate
2033: reasons for which we cannot here particularize. Only so much seems
2034: necessary, by way of introduction of premonition, that there are two
2035: sources of human knowledge (which probably spring from a common, but to
2036: us unknown root), namely, sense and understanding. By the former,
2037: objects are given to us; by the latter, thought. So far as the faculty
2038: of sense may contain representations à priori, which form the
2039: conditions under which objects are given, in so far it belongs to
2040: transcendental philosophy. The transcendental doctrine of sense must
2041: form the first part of our science of elements, because the conditions
2042: under which alone the objects of human knowledge are given must precede
2043: those under which they are thought.
2044:

2046: 
2047: I. TRANSCENDENTAL DOCTRINE OF ELEMENTS.
2048: 
2049: FIRST PART. TRANSCENDENTAL ÆSTHETIC.
2050: 
2051: § I. Introductory.
2052: 
2053: In whatsoever mode, or by whatsoever means, our knowledge may relate to
2054: objects, it is at least quite clear that the only manner in which it
2055: immediately relates to them is by means of an intuition. To this as the
2056: indispensable groundwork, all thought points. But an intuition can take
2057: place only in so far as the object is given to us. This, again, is only
2058: possible, to man at least, on condition that the object affect the mind
2059: in a certain manner. The capacity for receiving representations
2060: (receptivity) through the mode in which we are affected by objects,
2061: objects, is called sensibility. By means of sensibility, therefore,
2062: objects are given to us, and it alone furnishes us with intuitions; by
2063: the understanding they are thought, and from it arise conceptions. But
2064: an thought must directly, or indirectly, by means of certain signs,
2065: relate ultimately to intuitions; consequently, with us, to sensibility,
2066: because in no other way can an object be given to us.
2067: 
2068: The effect of an object upon the faculty of representation, so far as
2069: we are affected by the said object, is sensation. That sort of
2070: intuition which relates to an object by means of sensation is called an
2071: empirical intuition. The undetermined object of an empirical intuition
2072: is called phenomenon. That which in the phenomenon corresponds to the
2073: sensation, I term its matter; but that which effects that the content
2074: of the phenomenon can be arranged under certain relations, I call its
2075: form. But that in which our sensations are merely arranged, and by
2076: which they are susceptible of assuming a certain form, cannot be itself
2077: sensation. It is, then, the matter of all phenomena that is given to us
2078: à posteriori; the form must lie ready à priori for them in the mind,
2079: and consequently can be regarded separately from all sensation.
2080: 
2081: I call all representations pure, in the transcendental meaning of the
2082: word, wherein nothing is met with that belongs to sensation. And
2083: accordingly we find existing in the mind à priori, the pure form of
2084: sensuous intuitions in general, in which all the manifold content of
2085: the phenomenal world is arranged and viewed under certain relations.
2086: This pure form of sensibility I shall call pure intuition. Thus, if I
2087: take away from our representation of a body all that the understanding
2088: thinks as belonging to it, as substance, force, divisibility, etc., and
2089: also whatever belongs to sensation, as impenetrability, hardness,
2090: colour, etc.; yet there is still something left us from this empirical
2091: intuition, namely, extension and shape. These belong to pure intuition,
2092: which exists à priori in the mind, as a mere form of sensibility, and
2093: without any real object of the senses or any sensation.
2094: 
2095: The science of all the principles of sensibility à priori, I call
2096: transcendental æsthetic.[10] There must, then, be such a science
2097: forming the first part of the transcendental doctrine of elements, in
2098: contradistinction to that part which contains the principles of pure
2099: thought, and which is called transcendental logic.
2100: 
2101:  [10] The Germans are the only people who at present use this word to
2102:  indicate what others call the critique of taste. At the foundation of
2103:  this term lies the disappointed hope, which the eminent analyst,
2104:  Baumgarten, conceived, of subjecting the criticism of the beautiful to
2105:  principles of reason, and so of elevating its rules into a science.
2106:  But his endeavours were vain. For the said rules or criteria are, in
2107:  respect to their chief sources, merely empirical, consequently never
2108:  can serve as determinate laws à priori, by which our judgement in
2109:  matters of taste is to be directed. It is rather our judgement which
2110:  forms the proper test as to the correctness of the principles. On this
2111:  account it is advisable to give up the use of the term as designating
2112:  the critique of taste, and to apply it solely to that doctrine, which
2113:  is true science—the science of the laws of sensibility—and thus come
2114:  nearer to the language and the sense of the ancients in their
2115:  well-known division of the objects of cognition into aiotheta kai
2116:  noeta, or to share it with speculative philosophy, and employ it
2117:  partly in a transcendental, partly in a psychological signification.
2118: 
2119: 
2120: In the science of transcendental æsthetic accordingly, we shall first
2121: isolate sensibility or the sensuous faculty, by separating from it all
2122: that is annexed to its perceptions by the conceptions of understanding,
2123: so that nothing be left but empirical intuition. In the next place we
2124: shall take away from this intuition all that belongs to sensation, so
2125: that nothing may remain but pure intuition, and the mere form of
2126: phenomena, which is all that the sensibility can afford à priori. From
2127: this investigation it will be found that there are two pure forms of
2128: sensuous intuition, as principles of knowledge à priori, namely, space
2129: and time. To the consideration of these we shall now proceed.
2130: 
2131: SECTION I. Of Space.
2132: 
2133: § 2. Metaphysical Exposition of this Conception.
2134: 
2135: By means of the external sense (a property of the mind), we represent
2136: to ourselves objects as without us, and these all in space. Herein
2137: alone are their shape, dimensions, and relations to each other
2138: determined or determinable. The internal sense, by means of which the
2139: mind contemplates itself or its internal state, gives, indeed, no
2140: intuition of the soul as an object; yet there is nevertheless a
2141: determinate form, under which alone the contemplation of our internal
2142: state is possible, so that all which relates to the inward
2143: determinations of the mind is represented in relations of time. Of time
2144: we cannot have any external intuition, any more than we can have an
2145: internal intuition of space. What then are time and space? Are they
2146: real existences? Or, are they merely relations or determinations of
2147: things, such, however, as would equally belong to these things in
2148: themselves, though they should never become objects of intuition; or,
2149: are they such as belong only to the form of intuition, and consequently
2150: to the subjective constitution of the mind, without which these
2151: predicates of time and space could not be attached to any object? In
2152: order to become informed on these points, we shall first give an
2153: exposition of the conception of space. By exposition, I mean the clear,
2154: though not detailed, representation of that which belongs to a
2155: conception; and an exposition is metaphysical when it contains that
2156: which represents the conception as given à priori.
2157: 
2158: 1. Space is not a conception which has been derived from outward
2159: experiences. For, in order that certain sensations may relate to
2160: something without me (that is, to something which occupies a different
2161: part of space from that in which I am); in like manner, in order that I
2162: may represent them not merely as without, of, and near to each other,
2163: but also in separate places, the representation of space must already
2164: exist as a foundation. Consequently, the representation of space cannot
2165: be borrowed from the relations of external phenomena through
2166: experience; but, on the contrary, this external experience is itself
2167: only possible through the said antecedent representation.
2168: 
2169: 2. Space then is a necessary representation à priori, which serves for
2170: the foundation of all external intuitions. We never can imagine or make
2171: a representation to ourselves of the non-existence of space, though we
2172: may easily enough think that no objects are found in it. It must,
2173: therefore, be considered as the condition of the possibility of
2174: phenomena, and by no means as a determination dependent on them, and is
2175: a representation à priori, which necessarily supplies the basis for
2176: external phenomena.
2177: 
2178: 3. Space is no discursive, or as we say, general conception of the
2179: relations of things, but a pure intuition. For, in the first place, we
2180: can only represent to ourselves one space, and, when we talk of divers
2181: spaces, we mean only parts of one and the same space. Moreover, these
2182: parts cannot antecede this one all-embracing space, as the component
2183: parts from which the aggregate can be made up, but can be cogitated
2184: only as existing in it. Space is essentially one, and multiplicity in
2185: it, consequently the general notion of spaces, of this or that space,
2186: depends solely upon limitations. Hence it follows that an à priori
2187: intuition (which is not empirical) lies at the root of all our
2188: conceptions of space. Thus, moreover, the principles of geometry—for
2189: example, that “in a triangle, two sides together are greater than the
2190: third,” are never deduced from general conceptions of line and
2191: triangle, but from intuition, and this à priori, with apodeictic
2192: certainty.
2193: 
2194: 4. Space is represented as an infinite given quantity. Now every
2195: conception must indeed be considered as a representation which is
2196: contained in an infinite multitude of different possible
2197: representations, which, therefore, comprises these under itself; but no
2198: conception, as such, can be so conceived, as if it contained within
2199: itself an infinite multitude of representations. Nevertheless, space is
2200: so conceived of, for all parts of space are equally capable of being
2201: produced to infinity. Consequently, the original representation of
2202: space is an intuition à priori, and not a conception.
2203: 
2204: § 3. Transcendental Exposition of the Conception of Space.
2205: 
2206: By a transcendental exposition, I mean the explanation of a conception,
2207: as a principle, whence can be discerned the possibility of other
2208: synthetical à priori cognitions. For this purpose, it is requisite,
2209: firstly, that such cognitions do really flow from the given conception;
2210: and, secondly, that the said cognitions are only possible under the
2211: presupposition of a given mode of explaining this conception.
2212: 
2213: Geometry is a science which determines the properties of space
2214: synthetically, and yet à priori. What, then, must be our representation
2215: of space, in order that such a cognition of it may be possible? It must
2216: be originally intuition, for from a mere conception, no propositions
2217: can be deduced which go out beyond the conception, and yet this happens
2218: in geometry. (Introd. V.) But this intuition must be found in the mind
2219: à priori, that is, before any perception of objects, consequently must
2220: be pure, not empirical, intuition. For geometrical principles are
2221: always apodeictic, that is, united with the consciousness of their
2222: necessity, as: “Space has only three dimensions.” But propositions of
2223: this kind cannot be empirical judgements, nor conclusions from them.
2224: (Introd. II.) Now, how can an external intuition anterior to objects
2225: themselves, and in which our conception of objects can be determined à
2226: priori, exist in the human mind? Obviously not otherwise than in so far
2227: as it has its seat in the subject only, as the formal capacity of the
2228: subject’s being affected by objects, and thereby of obtaining immediate
2229: representation, that is, intuition; consequently, only as the form of
2230: the external sense in general.
2231: 
2232: Thus it is only by means of our explanation that the possibility of
2233: geometry, as a synthetical science à priori, becomes comprehensible.
2234: Every mode of explanation which does not show us this possibility,
2235: although in appearance it may be similar to ours, can with the utmost
2236: certainty be distinguished from it by these marks.
2237: 
2238: § 4. Conclusions from the foregoing Conceptions.
2239: 
2240: (a) Space does not represent any property of objects as things in
2241: themselves, nor does it represent them in their relations to each
2242: other; in other words, space does not represent to us any determination
2243: of objects such as attaches to the objects themselves, and would
2244: remain, even though all subjective conditions of the intuition were
2245: abstracted. For neither absolute nor relative determinations of objects
2246: can be intuited prior to the existence of the things to which they
2247: belong, and therefore not à priori.
2248: 
2249: (b) Space is nothing else than the form of all phenomena of the
2250: external sense, that is, the subjective condition of the sensibility,
2251: under which alone external intuition is possible. Now, because the
2252: receptivity or capacity of the subject to be affected by objects
2253: necessarily antecedes all intuitions of these objects, it is easily
2254: understood how the form of all phenomena can be given in the mind
2255: previous to all actual perceptions, therefore à priori, and how it, as
2256: a pure intuition, in which all objects must be determined, can contain
2257: principles of the relations of these objects prior to all experience.
2258: 
2259: It is therefore from the human point of view only that we can speak of
2260: space, extended objects, etc. If we depart from the subjective
2261: condition, under which alone we can obtain external intuition, or, in
2262: other words, by means of which we are affected by objects, the
2263: representation of space has no meaning whatsoever. This predicate is
2264: only applicable to things in so far as they appear to us, that is, are
2265: objects of sensibility. The constant form of this receptivity, which we
2266: call sensibility, is a necessary condition of all relations in which
2267: objects can be intuited as existing without us, and when abstraction of
2268: these objects is made, is a pure intuition, to which we give the name
2269: of space. It is clear that we cannot make the special conditions of
2270: sensibility into conditions of the possibility of things, but only of
2271: the possibility of their existence as far as they are phenomena. And so
2272: we may correctly say that space contains all which can appear to us
2273: externally, but not all things considered as things in themselves, be
2274: they intuited or not, or by whatsoever subject one will. As to the
2275: intuitions of other thinking beings, we cannot judge whether they are
2276: or are not bound by the same conditions which limit our own intuition,
2277: and which for us are universally valid. If we join the limitation of a
2278: judgement to the conception of the subject, then the judgement will
2279: possess unconditioned validity. For example, the proposition, “All
2280: objects are beside each other in space,” is valid only under the
2281: limitation that these things are taken as objects of our sensuous
2282: intuition. But if I join the condition to the conception and say, “All
2283: things, as external phenomena, are beside each other in space,” then
2284: the rule is valid universally, and without any limitation. Our
2285: expositions, consequently, teach the reality (i.e., the objective
2286: validity) of space in regard of all which can be presented to us
2287: externally as object, and at the same time also the ideality of space
2288: in regard to objects when they are considered by means of reason as
2289: things in themselves, that is, without reference to the constitution of
2290: our sensibility. We maintain, therefore, the empirical reality of space
2291: in regard to all possible external experience, although we must admit
2292: its transcendental ideality; in other words, that it is nothing, so
2293: soon as we withdraw the condition upon which the possibility of all
2294: experience depends and look upon space as something that belongs to
2295: things in themselves.
2296: 
2297: But, with the exception of space, there is no representation,
2298: subjective and referring to something external to us, which could be
2299: called objective à priori. For there are no other subjective
2300: representations from which we can deduce synthetical propositions à
2301: priori, as we can from the intuition of space. (See § 3.) Therefore, to
2302: speak accurately, no ideality whatever belongs to these, although they
2303: agree in this respect with the representation of space, that they
2304: belong merely to the subjective nature of the mode of sensuous
2305: perception; such a mode, for example, as that of sight, of hearing, and
2306: of feeling, by means of the sensations of colour, sound, and heat, but
2307: which, because they are only sensations and not intuitions, do not of
2308: themselves give us the cognition of any object, least of all, an à
2309: priori cognition. My purpose, in the above remark, is merely this: to
2310: guard any one against illustrating the asserted ideality of space by
2311: examples quite insufficient, for example, by colour, taste, etc.; for
2312: these must be contemplated not as properties of things, but only as
2313: changes in the subject, changes which may be different in different
2314: men. For, in such a case, that which is originally a mere phenomenon, a
2315: rose, for example, is taken by the empirical understanding for a thing
2316: in itself, though to every different eye, in respect of its colour, it
2317: may appear different. On the contrary, the transcendental conception of
2318: phenomena in space is a critical admonition, that, in general, nothing
2319: which is intuited in space is a thing in itself, and that space is not
2320: a form which belongs as a property to things; but that objects are
2321: quite unknown to us in themselves, and what we call outward objects,
2322: are nothing else but mere representations of our sensibility, whose
2323: form is space, but whose real correlate, the thing in itself, is not
2324: known by means of these representations, nor ever can be, but
2325: respecting which, in experience, no inquiry is ever made.
2326: 
2327: SECTION II. Of Time.
2328: 
2329: § 5. Metaphysical Exposition of this Conception.
2330: 
2331: 1. Time is not an empirical conception. For neither coexistence nor
2332: succession would be perceived by us, if the representation of time did
2333: not exist as a foundation à priori. Without this presupposition we
2334: could not represent to ourselves that things exist together at one and
2335: the same time, or at different times, that is, contemporaneously, or in
2336: succession.
2337: 
2338: 2. Time is a necessary representation, lying at the foundation of all
2339: our intuitions. With regard to phenomena in general, we cannot think
2340: away time from them, and represent them to ourselves as out of and
2341: unconnected with time, but we can quite well represent to ourselves
2342: time void of phenomena. Time is therefore given à priori. In it alone
2343: is all reality of phenomena possible. These may all be annihilated in
2344: thought, but time itself, as the universal condition of their
2345: possibility, cannot be so annulled.
2346: 
2347: 3. On this necessity à priori is also founded the possibility of
2348: apodeictic principles of the relations of time, or axioms of time in
2349: general, such as: “Time has only one dimension,” “Different times are
2350: not coexistent but successive” (as different spaces are not successive
2351: but coexistent). These principles cannot be derived from experience,
2352: for it would give neither strict universality, nor apodeictic
2353: certainty. We should only be able to say, “so common experience teaches
2354: us,” but not “it must be so.” They are valid as rules, through which,
2355: in general, experience is possible; and they instruct us respecting
2356: experience, and not by means of it.
2357: 
2358: 4. Time is not a discursive, or as it is called, general conception,
2359: but a pure form of the sensuous intuition. Different times are merely
2360: parts of one and the same time. But the representation which can only
2361: be given by a single object is an intuition. Besides, the proposition
2362: that different times cannot be coexistent could not be derived from a
2363: general conception. For this proposition is synthetical, and therefore
2364: cannot spring out of conceptions alone. It is therefore contained
2365: immediately in the intuition and representation of time.
2366: 
2367: 5. The infinity of time signifies nothing more than that every
2368: determined quantity of time is possible only through limitations of one
2369: time lying at the foundation. Consequently, the original
2370: representation, time, must be given as unlimited. But as the
2371: determinate representation of the parts of time and of every quantity
2372: of an object can only be obtained by limitation, the complete
2373: representation of time must not be furnished by means of conceptions,
2374: for these contain only partial representations. Conceptions, on the
2375: contrary, must have immediate intuition for their basis.
2376: 
2377: § 6 Transcendental Exposition of the Conception of Time.
2378: 
2379: I may here refer to what is said above (§ 5, 3), where, for or sake of
2380: brevity, I have placed under the head of metaphysical exposition, that
2381: which is properly transcendental. Here I shall add that the conception
2382: of change, and with it the conception of motion, as change of place, is
2383: possible only through and in the representation of time; that if this
2384: representation were not an intuition (internal) à priori, no
2385: conception, of whatever kind, could render comprehensible the
2386: possibility of change, in other words, of a conjunction of
2387: contradictorily opposed predicates in one and the same object, for
2388: example, the presence of a thing in a place and the non-presence of the
2389: same thing in the same place. It is only in time that it is possible to
2390: meet with two contradictorily opposed determinations in one thing, that
2391: is, after each other. Thus our conception of time explains the
2392: possibility of so much synthetical knowledge à priori, as is exhibited
2393: in the general doctrine of motion, which is not a little fruitful.
2394: 
2395: § 7. Conclusions from the above Conceptions.
2396: 
2397: (a) Time is not something which subsists of itself, or which inheres in
2398: things as an objective determination, and therefore remains, when
2399: abstraction is made of the subjective conditions of the intuition of
2400: things. For in the former case, it would be something real, yet without
2401: presenting to any power of perception any real object. In the latter
2402: case, as an order or determination inherent in things themselves, it
2403: could not be antecedent to things, as their condition, nor discerned or
2404: intuited by means of synthetical propositions à priori. But all this is
2405: quite possible when we regard time as merely the subjective condition
2406: under which all our intuitions take place. For in that case, this form
2407: of the inward intuition can be represented prior to the objects, and
2408: consequently à priori.
2409: 
2410: (b) Time is nothing else than the form of the internal sense, that is,
2411: of the intuitions of self and of our internal state. For time cannot be
2412: any determination of outward phenomena. It has to do neither with shape
2413: nor position; on the contrary, it determines the relation of
2414: representations in our internal state. And precisely because this
2415: internal intuition presents to us no shape or form, we endeavour to
2416: supply this want by analogies, and represent the course of time by a
2417: line progressing to infinity, the content of which constitutes a series
2418: which is only of one dimension; and we conclude from the properties of
2419: this line as to all the properties of time, with this single exception,
2420: that the parts of the line are coexistent, whilst those of time are
2421: successive. From this it is clear also that the representation of time
2422: is itself an intuition, because all its relations can be expressed in
2423: an external intuition.
2424: 
2425: (c) Time is the formal condition à priori of all phenomena whatsoever.
2426: Space, as the pure form of external intuition, is limited as a
2427: condition à priori to external phenomena alone. On the other hand,
2428: because all representations, whether they have or have not external
2429: things for their objects, still in themselves, as determinations of the
2430: mind, belong to our internal state; and because this internal state is
2431: subject to the formal condition of the internal intuition, that is, to
2432: time—time is a condition à priori of all phenomena whatsoever—the
2433: immediate condition of all internal, and thereby the mediate condition
2434: of all external phenomena. If I can say à priori, “All outward
2435: phenomena are in space, and determined à priori according to the
2436: relations of space,” I can also, from the principle of the internal
2437: sense, affirm universally, “All phenomena in general, that is, all
2438: objects of the senses, are in time and stand necessarily in relations
2439: of time.”
2440: 
2441: If we abstract our internal intuition of ourselves and all external
2442: intuitions, possible only by virtue of this internal intuition and
2443: presented to us by our faculty of representation, and consequently take
2444: objects as they are in themselves, then time is nothing. It is only of
2445: objective validity in regard to phenomena, because these are things
2446: which we regard as objects of our senses. It no longer objective we,
2447: make abstraction of the sensuousness of our intuition, in other words,
2448: of that mode of representation which is peculiar to us, and speak of
2449: things in general. Time is therefore merely a subjective condition of
2450: our (human) intuition (which is always sensuous, that is, so far as we
2451: are affected by objects), and in itself, independently of the mind or
2452: subject, is nothing. Nevertheless, in respect of all phenomena,
2453: consequently of all things which come within the sphere of our
2454: experience, it is necessarily objective. We cannot say, “All things are
2455: in time,” because in this conception of things in general, we abstract
2456: and make no mention of any sort of intuition of things. But this is the
2457: proper condition under which time belongs to our representation of
2458: objects. If we add the condition to the conception, and say, “All
2459: things, as phenomena, that is, objects of sensuous intuition, are in
2460: time,” then the proposition has its sound objective validity and
2461: universality à priori.
2462: 
2463: What we have now set forth teaches, therefore, the empirical reality of
2464: time; that is, its objective validity in reference to all objects which
2465: can ever be presented to our senses. And as our intuition is always
2466: sensuous, no object ever can be presented to us in experience, which
2467: does not come under the conditions of time. On the other hand, we deny
2468: to time all claim to absolute reality; that is, we deny that it,
2469: without having regard to the form of our sensuous intuition, absolutely
2470: inheres in things as a condition or property. Such properties as belong
2471: to objects as things in themselves never can be presented to us through
2472: the medium of the senses. Herein consists, therefore, the
2473: transcendental ideality of time, according to which, if we abstract the
2474: subjective conditions of sensuous intuition, it is nothing, and cannot
2475: be reckoned as subsisting or inhering in objects as things in
2476: themselves, independently of its relation to our intuition. This
2477: ideality, like that of space, is not to be proved or illustrated by
2478: fallacious analogies with sensations, for this reason—that in such
2479: arguments or illustrations, we make the presupposition that the
2480: phenomenon, in which such and such predicates inhere, has objective
2481: reality, while in this case we can only find such an objective reality
2482: as is itself empirical, that is, regards the object as a mere
2483: phenomenon. In reference to this subject, see the remark in Section I
2484: (§ 4)
2485: 
2486: § 8. Elucidation.
2487: 
2488: Against this theory, which grants empirical reality to time, but denies
2489: to it absolute and transcendental reality, I have heard from
2490: intelligent men an objection so unanimously urged that I conclude that
2491: it must naturally present itself to every reader to whom these
2492: considerations are novel. It runs thus: “Changes are real” (this the
2493: continual change in our own representations demonstrates, even though
2494: the existence of all external phenomena, together with their changes,
2495: is denied). Now, changes are only possible in time, and therefore time
2496: must be something real. But there is no difficulty in answering this. I
2497: grant the whole argument. Time, no doubt, is something real, that is,
2498: it is the real form of our internal intuition. It therefore has
2499: subjective reality, in reference to our internal experience, that is, I
2500: have really the representation of time and of my determinations
2501: therein. Time, therefore, is not to be regarded as an object, but as
2502: the mode of representation of myself as an object. But if I could
2503: intuite myself, or be intuited by another being, without this condition
2504: of sensibility, then those very determinations which we now represent
2505: to ourselves as changes, would present to us a knowledge in which the
2506: representation of time, and consequently of change, would not appear.
2507: The empirical reality of time, therefore, remains, as the condition of
2508: all our experience. But absolute reality, according to what has been
2509: said above, cannot be granted it. Time is nothing but the form of our
2510: internal intuition.[11] If we take away from it the special condition
2511: of our sensibility, the conception of time also vanishes; and it
2512: inheres not in the objects themselves, but solely in the subject (or
2513: mind) which intuites them.
2514: 
2515:  [11] I can indeed say “my representations follow one another, or are
2516:  successive”; but this means only that we are conscious of them as in a
2517:  succession, that is, according to the form of the internal sense.
2518:  Time, therefore, is not a thing in itself, nor is it any objective
2519:  determination pertaining to, or inherent in things.
2520: 
2521: 
2522: But the reason why this objection is so unanimously brought against our
2523: doctrine of time, and that too by disputants who cannot start any
2524: intelligible arguments against the doctrine of the ideality of space,
2525: is this—they have no hope of demonstrating apodeictically the absolute
2526: reality of space, because the doctrine of idealism is against them,
2527: according to which the reality of external objects is not capable of
2528: any strict proof. On the other hand, the reality of the object of our
2529: internal sense (that is, myself and my internal state) is clear
2530: immediately through consciousness. The former—external objects in
2531: space—might be a mere delusion, but the latter—the object of my
2532: internal perception—is undeniably real. They do not, however, reflect
2533: that both, without question of their reality as representations, belong
2534: only to the genus phenomenon, which has always two aspects, the one,
2535: the object considered as a thing in itself, without regard to the mode
2536: of intuiting it, and the nature of which remains for this very reason
2537: problematical, the other, the form of our intuition of the object,
2538: which must be sought not in the object as a thing in itself, but in the
2539: subject to which it appears—which form of intuition nevertheless
2540: belongs really and necessarily to the phenomenal object.
2541: 
2542: Time and space are, therefore, two sources of knowledge, from which, à
2543: priori, various synthetical cognitions can be drawn. Of this we find a
2544: striking example in the cognitions of space and its relations, which
2545: form the foundation of pure mathematics. They are the two pure forms of
2546: all intuitions, and thereby make synthetical propositions à priori
2547: possible. But these sources of knowledge being merely conditions of our
2548: sensibility, do therefore, and as such, strictly determine their own
2549: range and purpose, in that they do not and cannot present objects as
2550: things in themselves, but are applicable to them solely in so far as
2551: they are considered as sensuous phenomena. The sphere of phenomena is
2552: the only sphere of their validity, and if we venture out of this, no
2553: further objective use can be made of them. For the rest, this formal
2554: reality of time and space leaves the validity of our empirical
2555: knowledge unshaken; for our certainty in that respect is equally firm,
2556: whether these forms necessarily inhere in the things themselves, or
2557: only in our intuitions of them. On the other hand, those who maintain
2558: the absolute reality of time and space, whether as essentially
2559: subsisting, or only inhering, as modifications, in things, must find
2560: themselves at utter variance with the principles of experience itself.
2561: For, if they decide for the first view, and make space and time into
2562: substances, this being the side taken by mathematical natural
2563: philosophers, they must admit two self-subsisting nonentities, infinite
2564: and eternal, which exist (yet without there being anything real) for
2565: the purpose of containing in themselves everything that is real. If
2566: they adopt the second view of inherence, which is preferred by some
2567: metaphysical natural philosophers, and regard space and time as
2568: relations (contiguity in space or succession in time), abstracted from
2569: experience, though represented confusedly in this state of separation,
2570: they find themselves in that case necessitated to deny the validity of
2571: mathematical doctrines à priori in reference to real things (for
2572: example, in space)—at all events their apodeictic certainty. For such
2573: certainty cannot be found in an à posteriori proposition; and the
2574: conceptions à priori of space and time are, according to this opinion,
2575: mere creations of the imagination, having their source really in
2576: experience, inasmuch as, out of relations abstracted from experience,
2577: imagination has made up something which contains, indeed, general
2578: statements of these relations, yet of which no application can be made
2579: without the restrictions attached thereto by nature. The former of
2580: these parties gains this advantage, that they keep the sphere of
2581: phenomena free for mathematical science. On the other hand, these very
2582: conditions (space and time) embarrass them greatly, when the
2583: understanding endeavours to pass the limits of that sphere. The latter
2584: has, indeed, this advantage, that the representations of space and time
2585: do not come in their way when they wish to judge of objects, not as
2586: phenomena, but merely in their relation to the understanding. Devoid,
2587: however, of a true and objectively valid à priori intuition, they can
2588: neither furnish any basis for the possibility of mathematical
2589: cognitions à priori, nor bring the propositions of experience into
2590: necessary accordance with those of mathematics. In our theory of the
2591: true nature of these two original forms of the sensibility, both
2592: difficulties are surmounted.
2593: 
2594: In conclusion, that transcendental æsthetic cannot contain any more
2595: than these two elements—space and time, is sufficiently obvious from
2596: the fact that all other conceptions appertaining to sensibility, even
2597: that of motion, which unites in itself both elements, presuppose
2598: something empirical. Motion, for example, presupposes the perception of
2599: something movable. But space considered in itself contains nothing
2600: movable, consequently motion must be something which is found in space
2601: only through experience—in other words, an empirical datum. In like
2602: manner, transcendental æsthetic cannot number the conception of change
2603: among its data à priori; for time itself does not change, but only
2604: something which is in time. To acquire the conception of change,
2605: therefore, the perception of some existing object and of the succession
2606: of its determinations, in one word, experience, is necessary.
2607: 
2608: § 9. General Remarks on Transcendental Æsthetic.
2609: 
2610: I. In order to prevent any misunderstanding, it will be requisite, in
2611: the first place, to recapitulate, as clearly as possible, what our
2612: opinion is with respect to the fundamental nature of our sensuous
2613: cognition in general. We have intended, then, to say that all our
2614: intuition is nothing but the representation of phenomena; that the
2615: things which we intuite, are not in themselves the same as our
2616: representations of them in intuition, nor are their relations in
2617: themselves so constituted as they appear to us; and that if we take
2618: away the subject, or even only the subjective constitution of our
2619: senses in general, then not only the nature and relations of objects in
2620: space and time, but even space and time themselves disappear; and that
2621: these, as phenomena, cannot exist in themselves, but only in us. What
2622: may be the nature of objects considered as things in themselves and
2623: without reference to the receptivity of our sensibility is quite
2624: unknown to us. We know nothing more than our mode of perceiving them,
2625: which is peculiar to us, and which, though not of necessity pertaining
2626: to every animated being, is so to the whole human race. With this alone
2627: we have to do. Space and time are the pure forms thereof; sensation the
2628: matter. The former alone can we cognize à priori, that is, antecedent
2629: to all actual perception; and for this reason such cognition is called
2630: pure intuition. The latter is that in our cognition which is called
2631: cognition à posteriori, that is, empirical intuition. The former
2632: appertain absolutely and necessarily to our sensibility, of whatsoever
2633: kind our sensations may be; the latter may be of very diversified
2634: character. Supposing that we should carry our empirical intuition even
2635: to the very highest degree of clearness, we should not thereby advance
2636: one step nearer to a knowledge of the constitution of objects as things
2637: in themselves. For we could only, at best, arrive at a complete
2638: cognition of our own mode of intuition, that is of our sensibility, and
2639: this always under the conditions originally attaching to the subject,
2640: namely, the conditions of space and time; while the question: “What are
2641: objects considered as things in themselves?” remains unanswerable even
2642: after the most thorough examination of the phenomenal world.
2643: 
2644: To say, then, that all our sensibility is nothing but the confused
2645: representation of things containing exclusively that which belongs to
2646: them as things in themselves, and this under an accumulation of
2647: characteristic marks and partial representations which we cannot
2648: distinguish in consciousness, is a falsification of the conception of
2649: sensibility and phenomenization, which renders our whole doctrine
2650: thereof empty and useless. The difference between a confused and a
2651: clear representation is merely logical and has nothing to do with
2652: content. No doubt the conception of right, as employed by a sound
2653: understanding, contains all that the most subtle investigation could
2654: unfold from it, although, in the ordinary practical use of the word, we
2655: are not conscious of the manifold representations comprised in the
2656: conception. But we cannot for this reason assert that the ordinary
2657: conception is a sensuous one, containing a mere phenomenon, for right
2658: cannot appear as a phenomenon; but the conception of it lies in the
2659: understanding, and represents a property (the moral property) of
2660: actions, which belongs to them in themselves. On the other hand, the
2661: representation in intuition of a body contains nothing which could
2662: belong to an object considered as a thing in itself, but merely the
2663: phenomenon or appearance of something, and the mode in which we are
2664: affected by that appearance; and this receptivity of our faculty of
2665: cognition is called sensibility, and remains toto caelo different from
2666: the cognition of an object in itself, even though we should examine the
2667: content of the phenomenon to the very bottom.
2668: 
2669: It must be admitted that the Leibnitz-Wolfian philosophy has assigned
2670: an entirely erroneous point of view to all investigations into the
2671: nature and origin of our cognitions, inasmuch as it regards the
2672: distinction between the sensuous and the intellectual as merely
2673: logical, whereas it is plainly transcendental, and concerns not merely
2674: the clearness or obscurity, but the content and origin of both. For the
2675: faculty of sensibility not only does not present us with an indistinct
2676: and confused cognition of objects as things in themselves, but, in
2677: fact, gives us no knowledge of these at all. On the contrary, so soon
2678: as we abstract in thought our own subjective nature, the object
2679: represented, with the properties ascribed to it by sensuous intuition,
2680: entirely disappears, because it was only this subjective nature that
2681: determined the form of the object as a phenomenon.
2682: 
2683: In phenomena, we commonly, indeed, distinguish that which essentially
2684: belongs to the intuition of them, and is valid for the sensuous faculty
2685: of every human being, from that which belongs to the same intuition
2686: accidentally, as valid not for the sensuous faculty in general, but for
2687: a particular state or organization of this or that sense. Accordingly,
2688: we are accustomed to say that the former is a cognition which
2689: represents the object itself, whilst the latter presents only a
2690: particular appearance or phenomenon thereof. This distinction, however,
2691: is only empirical. If we stop here (as is usual), and do not regard the
2692: empirical intuition as itself a mere phenomenon (as we ought to do), in
2693: which nothing that can appertain to a thing in itself is to be found,
2694: our transcendental distinction is lost, and we believe that we cognize
2695: objects as things in themselves, although in the whole range of the
2696: sensuous world, investigate the nature of its objects as profoundly as
2697: we may, we have to do with nothing but phenomena. Thus, we call the
2698: rainbow a mere appearance of phenomenon in a sunny shower, and the
2699: rain, the reality or thing in itself; and this is right enough, if we
2700: understand the latter conception in a merely physical sense, that is,
2701: as that which in universal experience, and under whatever conditions of
2702: sensuous perception, is known in intuition to be so and so determined,
2703: and not otherwise. But if we consider this empirical datum generally,
2704: and inquire, without reference to its accordance with all our senses,
2705: whether there can be discovered in it aught which represents an object
2706: as a thing in itself (the raindrops of course are not such, for they
2707: are, as phenomena, empirical objects), the question of the relation of
2708: the representation to the object is transcendental; and not only are
2709: the raindrops mere phenomena, but even their circular form, nay, the
2710: space itself through which they fall, is nothing in itself, but both
2711: are mere modifications or fundamental dispositions of our sensuous
2712: intuition, whilst the transcendental object remains for us utterly
2713: unknown.
2714: 
2715: The second important concern of our æsthetic is that it does not obtain
2716: favour merely as a plausible hypothesis, but possess as undoubted a
2717: character of certainty as can be demanded of any theory which is to
2718: serve for an organon. In order fully to convince the reader of this
2719: certainty, we shall select a case which will serve to make its validity
2720: apparent, and also to illustrate what has been said in § 3.
2721: 
2722: Suppose, then, that space and time are in themselves objective, and
2723: conditions of the—possibility of objects as things in themselves. In
2724: the first place, it is evident that both present us, with very many
2725: apodeictic and synthetic propositions à priori, but especially
2726: space—and for this reason we shall prefer it for investigation at
2727: present. As the propositions of geometry are cognized synthetically à
2728: priori, and with apodeictic certainty, I inquire: Whence do you obtain
2729: propositions of this kind, and on what basis does the understanding
2730: rest, in order to arrive at such absolutely necessary and universally
2731: valid truths?
2732: 
2733: There is no other way than through intuitions or conceptions, as such;
2734: and these are given either à priori or à posteriori. The latter,
2735: namely, empirical conceptions, together with the empirical intuition on
2736: which they are founded, cannot afford any synthetical proposition,
2737: except such as is itself also empirical, that is, a proposition of
2738: experience. But an empirical proposition cannot possess the qualities
2739: of necessity and absolute universality, which, nevertheless, are the
2740: characteristics of all geometrical propositions. As to the first and
2741: only means to arrive at such cognitions, namely, through mere
2742: conceptions or intuitions à priori, it is quite clear that from mere
2743: conceptions no synthetical cognitions, but only analytical ones, can be
2744: obtained. Take, for example, the proposition: “Two straight lines
2745: cannot enclose a space, and with these alone no figure is possible,”
2746: and try to deduce it from the conception of a straight line and the
2747: number two; or take the proposition: “It is possible to construct a
2748: figure with three straight lines,” and endeavour, in like manner, to
2749: deduce it from the mere conception of a straight line and the number
2750: three. All your endeavours are in vain, and you find yourself forced to
2751: have recourse to intuition, as, in fact, geometry always does. You
2752: therefore give yourself an object in intuition. But of what kind is
2753: this intuition? Is it a pure à priori, or is it an empirical intuition?
2754: If the latter, then neither an universally valid, much less an
2755: apodeictic proposition can arise from it, for experience never can give
2756: us any such proposition. You must, therefore, give yourself an object à
2757: priori in intuition, and upon that ground your synthetical proposition.
2758: Now if there did not exist within you a faculty of intuition à priori;
2759: if this subjective condition were not in respect to its form also the
2760: universal condition à priori under which alone the object of this
2761: external intuition is itself possible; if the object (that is, the
2762: triangle) were something in itself, without relation to you the
2763: subject; how could you affirm that that which lies necessarily in your
2764: subjective conditions in order to construct a triangle, must also
2765: necessarily belong to the triangle in itself? For to your conceptions
2766: of three lines, you could not add anything new (that is, the figure);
2767: which, therefore, must necessarily be found in the object, because the
2768: object is given before your cognition, and not by means of it. If,
2769: therefore, space (and time also) were not a mere form of your
2770: intuition, which contains conditions à priori, under which alone things
2771: can become external objects for you, and without which subjective
2772: conditions the objects are in themselves nothing, you could not
2773: construct any synthetical proposition whatsoever regarding external
2774: objects. It is therefore not merely possible or probable, but
2775: indubitably certain, that space and time, as the necessary conditions
2776: of all our external and internal experience, are merely subjective
2777: conditions of all our intuitions, in relation to which all objects are
2778: therefore mere phenomena, and not things in themselves, presented to us
2779: in this particular manner. And for this reason, in respect to the form
2780: of phenomena, much may be said à priori, whilst of the thing in itself,
2781: which may lie at the foundation of these phenomena, it is impossible to
2782: say anything.
2783: 
2784: II. In confirmation of this theory of the ideality of the external as
2785: well as internal sense, consequently of all objects of sense, as mere
2786: phenomena, we may especially remark that all in our cognition that
2787: belongs to intuition contains nothing more than mere relations. (The
2788: feelings of pain and pleasure, and the will, which are not cognitions,
2789: are excepted.) The relations, to wit, of place in an intuition
2790: (extension), change of place (motion), and laws according to which this
2791: change is determined (moving forces). That, however, which is present
2792: in this or that place, or any operation going on, or result taking
2793: place in the things themselves, with the exception of change of place,
2794: is not given to us by intuition. Now by means of mere relations, a
2795: thing cannot be known in itself; and it may therefore be fairly
2796: concluded, that, as through the external sense nothing but mere
2797: representations of relations are given us, the said external sense in
2798: its representation can contain only the relation of the object to the
2799: subject, but not the essential nature of the object as a thing in
2800: itself.
2801: 
2802: The same is the case with the internal intuition, not only because, in
2803: the internal intuition, the representation of the external senses
2804: constitutes the material with which the mind is occupied; but because
2805: time, in which we place, and which itself antecedes the consciousness
2806: of, these representations in experience, and which, as the formal
2807: condition of the mode according to which objects are placed in the
2808: mind, lies at the foundation of them, contains relations of the
2809: successive, the coexistent, and of that which always must be coexistent
2810: with succession, the permanent. Now that which, as representation, can
2811: antecede every exercise of thought (of an object), is intuition; and
2812: when it contains nothing but relations, it is the form of the
2813: intuition, which, as it presents us with no representation, except in
2814: so far as something is placed in the mind, can be nothing else than the
2815: mode in which the mind is affected by its own activity, to wit—its
2816: presenting to itself representations, consequently the mode in which
2817: the mind is affected by itself; that is, it can be nothing but an
2818: internal sense in respect to its form. Everything that is represented
2819: through the medium of sense is so far phenomenal; consequently, we must
2820: either refuse altogether to admit an internal sense, or the subject,
2821: which is the object of that sense, could only be represented by it as
2822: phenomenon, and not as it would judge of itself, if its intuition were
2823: pure spontaneous activity, that is, were intellectual. The difficulty
2824: here lies wholly in the question: How can the subject have an internal
2825: intuition of itself? But this difficulty is common to every theory. The
2826: consciousness of self (apperception) is the simple representation of
2827: the “ego”; and if by means of that representation alone, all the
2828: manifold representations in the subject were spontaneously given, then
2829: our internal intuition would be intellectual. This consciousness in man
2830: requires an internal perception of the manifold representations which
2831: are previously given in the subject; and the manner in which these
2832: representations are given in the mind without spontaneity, must, on
2833: account of this difference (the want of spontaneity), be called
2834: sensibility. If the faculty of self-consciousness is to apprehend what
2835: lies in the mind, it must all act that and can in this way alone
2836: produce an intuition of self. But the form of this intuition, which
2837: lies in the original constitution of the mind, determines, in the
2838: representation of time, the manner in which the manifold
2839: representations are to combine themselves in the mind; since the
2840: subject intuites itself, not as it would represent itself immediately
2841: and spontaneously, but according to the manner in which the mind is
2842: internally affected, consequently, as it appears, and not as it is.
2843: 
2844: III. When we say that the intuition of external objects, and also the
2845: self-intuition of the subject, represent both, objects and subject, in
2846: space and time, as they affect our senses, that is, as they appear—this
2847: is by no means equivalent to asserting that these objects are mere
2848: illusory appearances. For when we speak of things as phenomena, the
2849: objects, nay, even the properties which we ascribe to them, are looked
2850: upon as really given; only that, in so far as this or that property
2851: depends upon the mode of intuition of the subject, in the relation of
2852: the given object to the subject, the object as phenomenon is to be
2853: distinguished from the object as a thing in itself. Thus I do not say
2854: that bodies seem or appear to be external to me, or that my soul seems
2855: merely to be given in my self-consciousness, although I maintain that
2856: the properties of space and time, in conformity to which I set both, as
2857: the condition of their existence, abide in my mode of intuition, and
2858: not in the objects in themselves. It would be my own fault, if out of
2859: that which I should reckon as phenomenon, I made mere illusory
2860: appearance.[12] But this will not happen, because of our principle of
2861: the ideality of all sensuous intuitions. On the contrary, if we ascribe
2862: objective reality to these forms of representation, it becomes
2863: impossible to avoid changing everything into mere appearance. For if we
2864: regard space and time as properties, which must be found in objects as
2865: things in themselves, as sine quibus non of the possibility of their
2866: existence, and reflect on the absurdities in which we then find
2867: ourselves involved, inasmuch as we are compelled to admit the existence
2868: of two infinite things, which are nevertheless not substances, nor
2869: anything really inhering in substances, nay, to admit that they are the
2870: necessary conditions of the existence of all things, and moreover, that
2871: they must continue to exist, although all existing things were
2872: annihilated—we cannot blame the good Berkeley for degrading bodies to
2873: mere illusory appearances. Nay, even our own existence, which would in
2874: this case depend upon the self-existent reality of such a mere
2875: nonentity as time, would necessarily be changed with it into mere
2876: appearance—an absurdity which no one has as yet been guilty of.
2877: 
2878:  [12] The predicates of the phenomenon can be affixed to the object
2879:  itself in relation to our sensuous faculty; for example, the red
2880:  colour or the perfume to the rose. But (illusory) appearance never can
2881:  be attributed as a predicate to an object, for this very reason, that
2882:  it attributes to this object in itself that which belongs to it only
2883:  in relation to our sensuous faculty, or to the subject in general,
2884:  e.g., the two handles which were formerly ascribed to Saturn. That
2885:  which is never to be found in the object itself, but always in the
2886:  relation of the object to the subject, and which moreover is
2887:  inseparable from our representation of the object, we denominate
2888:  phenomenon. Thus the predicates of space and time are rightly
2889:  attributed to objects of the senses as such, and in this there is no
2890:  illusion. On the contrary, if I ascribe redness of the rose as a thing
2891:  in itself, or to Saturn his handles, or extension to all external
2892:  objects, considered as things in themselves, without regarding the
2893:  determinate relation of these objects to the subject, and without
2894:  limiting my judgement to that relation—then, and then only, arises
2895:  illusion.
2896: 
2897: 
2898: IV. In natural theology, where we think of an object—God—which never
2899: can be an object of intuition to us, and even to himself can never be
2900: an object of sensuous intuition, we carefully avoid attributing to his
2901: intuition the conditions of space and time—and intuition all his
2902: cognition must be, and not thought, which always includes limitation.
2903: But with what right can we do this if we make them forms of objects as
2904: things in themselves, and such, moreover, as would continue to exist as
2905: à priori conditions of the existence of things, even though the things
2906: themselves were annihilated? For as conditions of all existence in
2907: general, space and time must be conditions of the existence of the
2908: Supreme Being also. But if we do not thus make them objective forms of
2909: all things, there is no other way left than to make them subjective
2910: forms of our mode of intuition—external and internal; which is called
2911: sensuous, because it is not primitive, that is, is not such as gives in
2912: itself the existence of the object of the intuition (a mode of
2913: intuition which, so far as we can judge, can belong only to the
2914: Creator), but is dependent on the existence of the object, is possible,
2915: therefore, only on condition that the representative faculty of the
2916: subject is affected by the object.
2917: 
2918: It is, moreover, not necessary that we should limit the mode of
2919: intuition in space and time to the sensuous faculty of man. It may well
2920: be that all finite thinking beings must necessarily in this respect
2921: agree with man (though as to this we cannot decide), but sensibility
2922: does not on account of this universality cease to be sensibility, for
2923: this very reason, that it is a deduced (intuitus derivativus), and not
2924: an original (intuitus originarius), consequently not an intellectual
2925: intuition, and this intuition, as such, for reasons above mentioned,
2926: seems to belong solely to the Supreme Being, but never to a being
2927: dependent, quoad its existence, as well as its intuition (which its
2928: existence determines and limits relatively to given objects). This
2929: latter remark, however, must be taken only as an illustration, and not
2930: as any proof of the truth of our æsthetical theory.
2931: 
2932: § 10. Conclusion of the Transcendental Æsthetic.
2933: 
2934: We have now completely before us one part of the solution of the grand
2935: general problem of transcendental philosophy, namely, the question:
2936: “How are synthetical propositions à priori possible?” That is to say,
2937: we have shown that we are in possession of pure à priori intuitions,
2938: namely, space and time, in which we find, when in a judgement à priori
2939: we pass out beyond the given conception, something which is not
2940: discoverable in that conception, but is certainly found à priori in the
2941: intuition which corresponds to the conception, and can be united
2942: synthetically with it. But the judgements which these pure intuitions
2943: enable us to make, never reach farther than to objects of the senses,
2944: and are valid only for objects of possible experience.
2945: 
2946: Second Part—TRANSCENDENTAL LOGIC
2947: 
2948: INTRODUCTION. Idea of a Transcendental Logic.
2949: 
2950: I. Of Logic in General.
2951: 
2952: Our knowledge springs from two main sources in the mind, first of which
2953: is the faculty or power of receiving representations (receptivity for
2954: impressions); the second is the power of cognizing by means of these
2955: representations (spontaneity in the production of conceptions). Through
2956: the first an object is given to us; through the second, it is, in
2957: relation to the representation (which is a mere determination of the
2958: mind), thought. Intuition and conceptions constitute, therefore, the
2959: elements of all our knowledge, so that neither conceptions without an
2960: intuition in some way corresponding to them, nor intuition without
2961: conceptions, can afford us a cognition. Both are either pure or
2962: empirical. They are empirical, when sensation (which presupposes the
2963: actual presence of the object) is contained in them; and pure, when no
2964: sensation is mixed with the representation. Sensations we may call the
2965: matter of sensuous cognition. Pure intuition consequently contains
2966: merely the form under which something is intuited, and pure conception
2967: only the form of the thought of an object. Only pure intuitions and
2968: pure conceptions are possible à priori; the empirical only à
2969: posteriori.
2970: 
2971: We apply the term sensibility to the receptivity of the mind for
2972: impressions, in so far as it is in some way affected; and, on the other
2973: hand, we call the faculty of spontaneously producing representations,
2974: or the spontaneity of cognition, understanding. Our nature is so
2975: constituted that intuition with us never can be other than sensuous,
2976: that is, it contains only the mode in which we are affected by objects.
2977: On the other hand, the faculty of thinking the object of sensuous
2978: intuition is the understanding. Neither of these faculties has a
2979: preference over the other. Without the sensuous faculty no object would
2980: be given to us, and without the understanding no object would be
2981: thought. Thoughts without content are void; intuitions without
2982: conceptions, blind. Hence it is as necessary for the mind to make its
2983: conceptions sensuous (that is, to join to them the object in
2984: intuition), as to make its intuitions intelligible (that is, to bring
2985: them under conceptions). Neither of these faculties can exchange its
2986: proper function. Understanding cannot intuite, and the sensuous faculty
2987: cannot think. In no other way than from the united operation of both,
2988: can knowledge arise. But no one ought, on this account, to overlook the
2989: difference of the elements contributed by each; we have rather great
2990: reason carefully to separate and distinguish them. We therefore
2991: distinguish the science of the laws of sensibility, that is, æsthetic,
2992: from the science of the laws of the understanding, that is, logic.
2993: 
2994: Now, logic in its turn may be considered as twofold—namely, as logic of
2995: the general, or of the particular use of the understanding. The first
2996: contains the absolutely necessary laws of thought, without which no use
2997: whatsoever of the understanding is possible, and gives laws therefore
2998: to the understanding, without regard to the difference of objects on
2999: which it may be employed. The logic of the particular use of the
3000: understanding contains the laws of correct thinking upon a particular
3001: class of objects. The former may be called elemental logic—the latter,
3002: the organon of this or that particular science. The latter is for the
3003: most part employed in the schools, as a propædeutic to the sciences,
3004: although, indeed, according to the course of human reason, it is the
3005: last thing we arrive at, when the science has been already matured, and
3006: needs only the finishing touches towards its correction and completion;
3007: for our knowledge of the objects of our attempted science must be
3008: tolerably extensive and complete before we can indicate the laws by
3009: which a science of these objects can be established.
3010: 
3011: General logic is again either pure or applied. In the former, we
3012: abstract all the empirical conditions under which the understanding is
3013: exercised; for example, the influence of the senses, the play of the
3014: fantasy or imagination, the laws of the memory, the force of habit, of
3015: inclination, etc., consequently also, the sources of prejudice—in a
3016: word, we abstract all causes from which particular cognitions arise,
3017: because these causes regard the understanding under certain
3018: circumstances of its application, and, to the knowledge of them
3019: experience is required. Pure general logic has to do, therefore, merely
3020: with pure à priori principles, and is a canon of understanding and
3021: reason, but only in respect of the formal part of their use, be the
3022: content what it may, empirical or transcendental. General logic is
3023: called applied, when it is directed to the laws of the use of the
3024: understanding, under the subjective empirical conditions which
3025: psychology teaches us. It has therefore empirical principles, although,
3026: at the same time, it is in so far general, that it applies to the
3027: exercise of the understanding, without regard to the difference of
3028: objects. On this account, moreover, it is neither a canon of the
3029: understanding in general, nor an organon of a particular science, but
3030: merely a cathartic of the human understanding.
3031: 
3032: In general logic, therefore, that part which constitutes pure logic
3033: must be carefully distinguished from that which constitutes applied
3034: (though still general) logic. The former alone is properly science,
3035: although short and dry, as the methodical exposition of an elemental
3036: doctrine of the understanding ought to be. In this, therefore,
3037: logicians must always bear in mind two rules:
3038: 
3039: 1. As general logic, it makes abstraction of all content of the
3040: cognition of the understanding, and of the difference of objects, and
3041: has to do with nothing but the mere form of thought.
3042: 
3043: 2. As pure logic, it has no empirical principles, and consequently
3044: draws nothing (contrary to the common persuasion) from psychology,
3045: which therefore has no influence on the canon of the understanding. It
3046: is a demonstrated doctrine, and everything in it must be certain
3047: completely à priori.
3048: 
3049: What I called applied logic (contrary to the common acceptation of this
3050: term, according to which it should contain certain exercises for the
3051: scholar, for which pure logic gives the rules), is a representation of
3052: the understanding, and of the rules of its necessary employment in
3053: concreto, that is to say, under the accidental conditions of the
3054: subject, which may either hinder or promote this employment, and which
3055: are all given only empirically. Thus applied logic treats of attention,
3056: its impediments and consequences, of the origin of error, of the state
3057: of doubt, hesitation, conviction, etc., and to it is related pure
3058: general logic in the same way that pure morality, which contains only
3059: the necessary moral laws of a free will, is related to practical
3060: ethics, which considers these laws under all the impediments of
3061: feelings, inclinations, and passions to which men are more or less
3062: subjected, and which never can furnish us with a true and demonstrated
3063: science, because it, as well as applied logic, requires empirical and
3064: psychological principles.
3065: 
3066: II. Of Transcendental Logic.
3067: 
3068: General logic, as we have seen, makes abstraction of all content of
3069: cognition, that is, of all relation of cognition to its object, and
3070: regards only the logical form in the relation of cognitions to each
3071: other, that is, the form of thought in general. But as we have both
3072: pure and empirical intuitions (as transcendental æsthetic proves), in
3073: like manner a distinction might be drawn between pure and empirical
3074: thought (of objects). In this case, there would exist a kind of logic,
3075: in which we should not make abstraction of all content of cognition;
3076: for or logic which should comprise merely the laws of pure thought (of
3077: an object), would of course exclude all those cognitions which were of
3078: empirical content. This kind of logic would also examine the origin of
3079: our cognitions of objects, so far as that origin cannot be ascribed to
3080: the objects themselves; while, on the contrary, general logic has
3081: nothing to do with the origin of our cognitions, but contemplates our
3082: representations, be they given primitively à priori in ourselves, or be
3083: they only of empirical origin, solely according to the laws which the
3084: understanding observes in employing them in the process of thought, in
3085: relation to each other. Consequently, general logic treats of the form
3086: of the understanding only, which can be applied to representations,
3087: from whatever source they may have arisen.
3088: 
3089: And here I shall make a remark, which the reader must bear well in mind
3090: in the course of the following considerations, to wit, that not every
3091: cognition à priori, but only those through which we cognize that and
3092: how certain representations (intuitions or conceptions) are applied or
3093: are possible only à priori; that is to say, the à priori possibility of
3094: cognition and the à priori use of it are transcendental. Therefore
3095: neither is space, nor any à priori geometrical determination of space,
3096: a transcendental Representation, but only the knowledge that such a
3097: representation is not of empirical origin, and the possibility of its
3098: relating to objects of experience, although itself à priori, can be
3099: called transcendental. So also, the application of space to objects in
3100: general would be transcendental; but if it be limited to objects of
3101: sense it is empirical. Thus, the distinction of the transcendental and
3102: empirical belongs only to the critique of cognitions, and does not
3103: concern the relation of these to their object.
3104: 
3105: Accordingly, in the expectation that there may perhaps be conceptions
3106: which relate à priori to objects, not as pure or sensuous intuitions,
3107: but merely as acts of pure thought (which are therefore conceptions,
3108: but neither of empirical nor æsthetical origin)—in this expectation, I
3109: say, we form to ourselves, by anticipation, the idea of a science of
3110: pure understanding and rational cognition, by means of which we may
3111: cogitate objects entirely à priori. A science of this kind, which
3112: should determine the origin, the extent, and the objective validity of
3113: such cognitions, must be called transcendental logic, because it has
3114: not, like general logic, to do with the laws of understanding and
3115: reason in relation to empirical as well as pure rational cognitions
3116: without distinction, but concerns itself with these only in an à priori
3117: relation to objects.
3118: 
3119: III. Of the Division of General Logic into Analytic and Dialectic.
3120: 
3121: The old question with which people sought to push logicians into a
3122: corner, so that they must either have recourse to pitiful sophisms or
3123: confess their ignorance, and consequently the vanity of their whole
3124: art, is this: “What is truth?” The definition of the word truth, to
3125: wit, “the accordance of the cognition with its object,” is presupposed
3126: in the question; but we desire to be told, in the answer to it, what is
3127: the universal and secure criterion of the truth of every cognition.
3128: 
3129: To know what questions we may reasonably propose is in itself a strong
3130: evidence of sagacity and intelligence. For if a question be in itself
3131: absurd and unsusceptible of a rational answer, it is attended with the
3132: danger—not to mention the shame that falls upon the person who proposes
3133: it—of seducing the unguarded listener into making absurd answers, and
3134: we are presented with the ridiculous spectacle of one (as the ancients
3135: said) “milking the he-goat, and the other holding a sieve.”
3136: 
3137: If truth consists in the accordance of a cognition with its object,
3138: this object must be, ipso facto, distinguished from all others; for a
3139: cognition is false if it does not accord with the object to which it
3140: relates, although it contains something which may be affirmed of other
3141: objects. Now an universal criterion of truth would be that which is
3142: valid for all cognitions, without distinction of their objects. But it
3143: is evident that since, in the case of such a criterion, we make
3144: abstraction of all the content of a cognition (that is, of all relation
3145: to its object), and truth relates precisely to this content, it must be
3146: utterly absurd to ask for a mark of the truth of this content of
3147: cognition; and that, accordingly, a sufficient, and at the same time
3148: universal, test of truth cannot possibly be found. As we have already
3149: termed the content of a cognition its matter, we shall say: “Of the
3150: truth of our cognitions in respect of their matter, no universal test
3151: can be demanded, because such a demand is self-contradictory.”
3152: 
3153: On the other hand, with regard to our cognition in respect of its mere
3154: form (excluding all content), it is equally manifest that logic, in so
3155: far as it exhibits the universal and necessary laws of the
3156: understanding, must in these very laws present us with criteria of
3157: truth. Whatever contradicts these rules is false, because thereby the
3158: understanding is made to contradict its own universal laws of thought;
3159: that is, to contradict itself. These criteria, however, apply solely to
3160: the form of truth, that is, of thought in general, and in so far they
3161: are perfectly accurate, yet not sufficient. For although a cognition
3162: may be perfectly accurate as to logical form, that is, not
3163: self-contradictory, it is notwithstanding quite possible that it may
3164: not stand in agreement with its object. Consequently, the merely
3165: logical criterion of truth, namely, the accordance of a cognition with
3166: the universal and formal laws of understanding and reason, is nothing
3167: more than the conditio sine qua non, or negative condition of all
3168: truth. Farther than this logic cannot go, and the error which depends
3169: not on the form, but on the content of the cognition, it has no test to
3170: discover.
3171: 
3172: General logic, then, resolves the whole formal business of
3173: understanding and reason into its elements, and exhibits them as
3174: principles of all logical judging of our cognitions. This part of logic
3175: may, therefore, be called analytic, and is at least the negative test
3176: of truth, because all cognitions must first of an be estimated and
3177: tried according to these laws before we proceed to investigate them in
3178: respect of their content, in order to discover whether they contain
3179: positive truth in regard to their object. Because, however, the mere
3180: form of a cognition, accurately as it may accord with logical laws, is
3181: insufficient to supply us with material (objective) truth, no one, by
3182: means of logic alone, can venture to predicate anything of or decide
3183: concerning objects, unless he has obtained, independently of logic,
3184: well-grounded information about them, in order afterwards to examine,
3185: according to logical laws, into the use and connection, in a cohering
3186: whole, of that information, or, what is still better, merely to test it
3187: by them. Notwithstanding, there lies so seductive a charm in the
3188: possession of a specious art like this—an art which gives to all our
3189: cognitions the form of the understanding, although with respect to the
3190: content thereof we may be sadly deficient—that general logic, which is
3191: merely a canon of judgement, has been employed as an organon for the
3192: actual production, or rather for the semblance of production, of
3193: objective assertions, and has thus been grossly misapplied. Now general
3194: logic, in its assumed character of organon, is called dialectic.
3195: 
3196: Different as are the significations in which the ancients used this
3197: term for a science or an art, we may safely infer, from their actual
3198: employment of it, that with them it was nothing else than a logic of
3199: illusion—a sophistical art for giving ignorance, nay, even intentional
3200: sophistries, the colouring of truth, in which the thoroughness of
3201: procedure which logic requires was imitated, and their topic employed
3202: to cloak the empty pretensions. Now it may be taken as a safe and
3203: useful warning, that general logic, considered as an organon, must
3204: always be a logic of illusion, that is, be dialectical, for, as it
3205: teaches us nothing whatever respecting the content of our cognitions,
3206: but merely the formal conditions of their accordance with the
3207: understanding, which do not relate to and are quite indifferent in
3208: respect of objects, any attempt to employ it as an instrument (organon)
3209: in order to extend and enlarge the range of our knowledge must end in
3210: mere prating; any one being able to maintain or oppose, with some
3211: appearance of truth, any single assertion whatever.
3212: 
3213: Such instruction is quite unbecoming the dignity of philosophy. For
3214: these reasons we have chosen to denominate this part of logic
3215: dialectic, in the sense of a critique of dialectical illusion, and we
3216: wish the term to be so understood in this place.
3217: 
3218: IV. Of the Division of Transcendental Logic into Transcendental
3219: Analytic and Dialectic.
3220: 
3221: In transcendental logic we isolate the understanding (as in
3222: transcendental æsthetic the sensibility) and select from our cognition
3223: merely that part of thought which has its origin in the understanding
3224: alone. The exercise of this pure cognition, however, depends upon this
3225: as its condition, that objects to which it may be applied be given to
3226: us in intuition, for without intuition the whole of our cognition is
3227: without objects, and is therefore quite void. That part of
3228: transcendental logic, then, which treats of the elements of pure
3229: cognition of the understanding, and of the principles without which no
3230: object at all can be thought, is transcendental analytic, and at the
3231: same time a logic of truth. For no cognition can contradict it, without
3232: losing at the same time all content, that is, losing all reference to
3233: an object, and therefore all truth. But because we are very easily
3234: seduced into employing these pure cognitions and principles of the
3235: understanding by themselves, and that even beyond the boundaries of
3236: experience, which yet is the only source whence we can obtain matter
3237: (objects) on which those pure conceptions may be employed—understanding
3238: runs the risk of making, by means of empty sophisms, a material and
3239: objective use of the mere formal principles of the pure understanding,
3240: and of passing judgements on objects without distinction—objects which
3241: are not given to us, nay, perhaps cannot be given to us in any way.
3242: Now, as it ought properly to be only a canon for judging of the
3243: empirical use of the understanding, this kind of logic is misused when
3244: we seek to employ it as an organon of the universal and unlimited
3245: exercise of the understanding, and attempt with the pure understanding
3246: alone to judge synthetically, affirm, and determine respecting objects
3247: in general. In this case the exercise of the pure understanding becomes
3248: dialectical. The second part of our transcendental logic must therefore
3249: be a critique of dialectical illusion, and this critique we shall term
3250: transcendental dialectic—not meaning it as an art of producing
3251: dogmatically such illusion (an art which is unfortunately too current
3252: among the practitioners of metaphysical juggling), but as a critique of
3253: understanding and reason in regard to their hyperphysical use. This
3254: critique will expose the groundless nature of the pretensions of these
3255: two faculties, and invalidate their claims to the discovery and
3256: enlargement of our cognitions merely by means of transcendental
3257: principles, and show that the proper employment of these faculties is
3258: to test the judgements made by the pure understanding, and to guard it
3259: from sophistical delusion.
3260: 
3261: FIRST DIVISION. TRANSCENDENTAL LOGIC. TRANSCENDENTAL ANALYTIC. § 1
3262: 
3263: Transcendental analytic is the dissection of the whole of our à priori
3264: knowledge into the elements of the pure cognition of the understanding.
3265: In order to effect our purpose, it is necessary: (1) That the
3266: conceptions be pure and not empirical; (2) That they belong not to
3267: intuition and sensibility, but to thought and understanding; (3) That
3268: they be elementary conceptions, and as such, quite different from
3269: deduced or compound conceptions; (4) That our table of these elementary
3270: conceptions be complete, and fill up the whole sphere of the pure
3271: understanding. Now this completeness of a science cannot be accepted
3272: with confidence on the guarantee of a mere estimate of its existence in
3273: an aggregate formed only by means of repeated experiments and attempts.
3274: The completeness which we require is possible only by means of an idea
3275: of the totality of the à priori cognition of the understanding, and
3276: through the thereby determined division of the conceptions which form
3277: the said whole; consequently, only by means of their connection in a
3278: system. Pure understanding distinguishes itself not merely from
3279: everything empirical, but also completely from all sensibility. It is a
3280: unity self-subsistent, self-sufficient, and not to be enlarged by any
3281: additions from without. Hence the sum of its cognition constitutes a
3282: system to be determined by and comprised under an idea; and the
3283: completeness and articulation of this system can at the same time serve
3284: as a test of the correctness and genuineness of all the parts of
3285: cognition that belong to it. The whole of this part of transcendental
3286: logic consists of two books, of which the one contains the conceptions,
3287: and the other the principles of pure understanding.
3288: 
3289: BOOK I. Analytic of Conceptions. § 2
3290: 
3291: By the term Analytic of Conceptions, I do not understand the analysis
3292: of these, or the usual process in philosophical investigations of
3293: dissecting the conceptions which present themselves, according to their
3294: content, and so making them clear; but I mean the hitherto little
3295: attempted dissection of the faculty of understanding itself, in order
3296: to investigate the possibility of conceptions à priori, by looking for
3297: them in the understanding alone, as their birthplace, and analysing the
3298: pure use of this faculty. For this is the proper duty of a
3299: transcendental philosophy; what remains is the logical treatment of the
3300: conceptions in philosophy in general. We shall therefore follow up the
3301: pure conceptions even to their germs and beginnings in the human
3302: understanding, in which they lie, until they are developed on occasions
3303: presented by experience, and, freed by the same understanding from the
3304: empirical conditions attaching to them, are set forth in their
3305: unalloyed purity.
3306: 
3307: Chapter I. Of the Transcendental Clue to the Discovery of all Pure 
3308: Conceptions of the Understanding
3309: 
3310: Introductory § 3
3311: 
3312: When we call into play a faculty of cognition, different conceptions
3313: manifest themselves according to the different circumstances, and make
3314: known this faculty, and assemble themselves into a more or less
3315: extensive collection, according to the time or penetration that has
3316: been applied to the consideration of them. Where this process,
3317: conducted as it is mechanically, so to speak, will end, cannot be
3318: determined with certainty. Besides, the conceptions which we discover
3319: in this haphazard manner present themselves by no means in order and
3320: systematic unity, but are at last coupled together only according to
3321: resemblances to each other, and arranged in series, according to the
3322: quantity of their content, from the simpler to the more complex—series
3323: which are anything but systematic, though not altogether without a
3324: certain kind of method in their construction.
3325: 
3326: Transcendental philosophy has the advantage, and moreover the duty, of
3327: searching for its conceptions according to a principle; because these
3328: conceptions spring pure and unmixed out of the understanding as an
3329: absolute unity, and therefore must be connected with each other
3330: according to one conception or idea. A connection of this kind,
3331: however, furnishes us with a ready prepared rule, by which its proper
3332: place may be assigned to every pure conception of the understanding,
3333: and the completeness of the system of all be determined à priori—both
3334: which would otherwise have been dependent on mere choice or chance.
3335: 
3336: Section I. Of the Logical Use of the Understanding in General § 4
3337: 
3338: The understanding was defined above only negatively, as a non-sensuous
3339: faculty of cognition. Now, independently of sensibility, we cannot
3340: possibly have any intuition; consequently, the understanding is no
3341: faculty of intuition. But besides intuition there is no other mode of
3342: cognition, except through conceptions; consequently, the cognition of
3343: every, at least of every human, understanding is a cognition through
3344: conceptions—not intuitive, but discursive. All intuitions, as sensuous,
3345: depend on affections; conceptions, therefore, upon functions. By the
3346: word function I understand the unity of the act of arranging diverse
3347: representations under one common representation. Conceptions, then, are
3348: based on the spontaneity of thought, as sensuous intuitions are on the
3349: receptivity of impressions. Now, the understanding cannot make any
3350: other use of these conceptions than to judge by means of them. As no
3351: representation, except an intuition, relates immediately to its object,
3352: a conception never relates immediately to an object, but only to some
3353: other representation thereof, be that an intuition or itself a
3354: conception. A judgement, therefore, is the mediate cognition of an
3355: object, consequently the representation of a representation of it. In
3356: every judgement there is a conception which applies to, and is valid
3357: for many other conceptions, and which among these comprehends also a
3358: given representation, this last being immediately connected with an
3359: object. For example, in the judgement—“All bodies are divisible,” our
3360: conception of divisible applies to various other conceptions; among
3361: these, however, it is here particularly applied to the conception of
3362: body, and this conception of body relates to certain phenomena which
3363: occur to us. These objects, therefore, are mediately represented by the
3364: conception of divisibility. All judgements, accordingly, are functions
3365: of unity in our representations, inasmuch as, instead of an immediate,
3366: a higher representation, which comprises this and various others, is
3367: used for our cognition of the object, and thereby many possible
3368: cognitions are collected into one. But we can reduce all acts of the
3369: understanding to judgements, so that understanding may be represented
3370: as the faculty of judging. For it is, according to what has been said
3371: above, a faculty of thought. Now thought is cognition by means of
3372: conceptions. But conceptions, as predicates of possible judgements,
3373: relate to some representation of a yet undetermined object. Thus the
3374: conception of body indicates something—for example, metal—which can be
3375: cognized by means of that conception. It is therefore a conception, for
3376: the reason alone that other representations are contained under it, by
3377: means of which it can relate to objects. It is therefore the predicate
3378: to a possible judgement; for example: “Every metal is a body.” All the
3379: functions of the understanding therefore can be discovered, when we can
3380: completely exhibit the functions of unity in judgements. And that this
3381: may be effected very easily, the following section will show.
3382: 
3383: Section II. Of the Logical Function of the Understanding in Judgements
3384: § 5
3385: 
3386: If we abstract all the content of a judgement, and consider only the
3387: intellectual form thereof, we find that the function of thought in a
3388: judgement can be brought under four heads, of which each contains three
3389: momenta. These may be conveniently represented in the following table:
3390: 
3391:                                     1
3392:                          _Quantity of judgements_
3393:                                 Universal
3394:                                 Particular
3395:                                 Singular
3396: 
3397:                       2                           3
3398:                     _Quality                   Relation_
3399:                   Affirmative                Categorical
3400:                   Negative                   Hypothetical
3401:                   Infinite                   Disjunctive
3402: 
3403:                                     4
3404:                                  _Modality_
3405:                                Problematical
3406:                                Assertorical
3407:                                Apodeictical
3408: 
3409: As this division appears to differ in some, though not essential
3410: points, from the usual technique of logicians, the following
3411: observations, for the prevention of otherwise possible
3412: misunderstanding, will not be without their use.
3413: 
3414: 1. Logicians say, with justice, that in the use of judgements in
3415: syllogisms, singular judgements may be treated like universal ones.
3416: For, precisely because a singular judgement has no extent at all, its
3417: predicate cannot refer to a part of that which is contained in the
3418: conception of the subject and be excluded from the rest. The predicate
3419: is valid for the whole conception just as if it were a general
3420: conception, and had extent, to the whole of which the predicate
3421: applied. On the other hand, let us compare a singular with a general
3422: judgement, merely as a cognition, in regard to quantity. The singular
3423: judgement relates to the general one, as unity to infinity, and is
3424: therefore in itself essentially different. Thus, if we estimate a
3425: singular judgement (_judicium singulare_) not merely according to its
3426: intrinsic validity as a judgement, but also as a cognition generally,
3427: according to its quantity in comparison with that of other cognitions,
3428: it is then entirely different from a general judgement (_judicium
3429: commune_), and in a complete table of the momenta of thought deserves a
3430: separate place—though, indeed, this would not be necessary in a logic
3431: limited merely to the consideration of the use of judgements in
3432: reference to each other.
3433: 
3434: 2. In like manner, in transcendental logic, infinite must be
3435: distinguished from affirmative judgements, although in general logic
3436: they are rightly enough classed under affirmative. General logic
3437: abstracts all content of the predicate (though it be negative), and
3438: only considers whether the said predicate be affirmed or denied of the
3439: subject. But transcendental logic considers also the worth or content
3440: of this logical affirmation—an affirmation by means of a merely
3441: negative predicate, and inquires how much the sum total of our
3442: cognition gains by this affirmation. For example, if I say of the soul,
3443: “It is not mortal”—by this negative judgement I should at least ward
3444: off error. Now, by the proposition, “The soul is not mortal,” I have,
3445: in respect of the logical form, really affirmed, inasmuch as I thereby
3446: place the soul in the unlimited sphere of immortal beings. Now, because
3447: of the whole sphere of possible existences, the mortal occupies one
3448: part, and the immortal the other, neither more nor less is affirmed by
3449: the proposition than that the soul is one among the infinite multitude
3450: of things which remain over, when I take away the whole mortal part.
3451: But by this proceeding we accomplish only this much, that the infinite
3452: sphere of all possible existences is in so far limited that the mortal
3453: is excluded from it, and the soul is placed in the remaining part of
3454: the extent of this sphere. But this part remains, notwithstanding this
3455: exception, infinite, and more and more parts may be taken away from the
3456: whole sphere, without in the slightest degree thereby augmenting or
3457: affirmatively determining our conception of the soul. These judgements,
3458: therefore, infinite in respect of their logical extent, are, in respect
3459: of the content of their cognition, merely limitative; and are
3460: consequently entitled to a place in our transcendental table of all the
3461: momenta of thought in judgements, because the function of the
3462: understanding exercised by them may perhaps be of importance in the
3463: field of its pure à priori cognition.
3464: 
3465: 3. All relations of thought in judgements are those (a) of the
3466: predicate to the subject; (b) of the principle to its consequence; (c)
3467: of the divided cognition and all the members of the division to each
3468: other. In the first of these three classes, we consider only two
3469: conceptions; in the second, two judgements; in the third, several
3470: judgements in relation to each other. The hypothetical proposition, “If
3471: perfect justice exists, the obstinately wicked are punished,” contains
3472: properly the relation to each other of two propositions, namely,
3473: “Perfect justice exists,” and “The obstinately wicked are punished.”
3474: Whether these propositions are in themselves true is a question not
3475: here decided. Nothing is cogitated by means of this judgement except a
3476: certain consequence. Finally, the disjunctive judgement contains a
3477: relation of two or more propositions to each other—a relation not of
3478: consequence, but of logical opposition, in so far as the sphere of the
3479: one proposition excludes that of the other. But it contains at the same
3480: time a relation of community, in so far as all the propositions taken
3481: together fill up the sphere of the cognition. The disjunctive judgement
3482: contains, therefore, the relation of the parts of the whole sphere of a
3483: cognition, since the sphere of each part is a complemental part of the
3484: sphere of the other, each contributing to form the sum total of the
3485: divided cognition. Take, for example, the proposition, “The world
3486: exists either through blind chance, or through internal necessity, or
3487: through an external cause.” Each of these propositions embraces a part
3488: of the sphere of our possible cognition as to the existence of a world;
3489: all of them taken together, the whole sphere. To take the cognition out
3490: of one of these spheres, is equivalent to placing it in one of the
3491: others; and, on the other hand, to place it in one sphere is equivalent
3492: to taking it out of the rest. There is, therefore, in a disjunctive
3493: judgement a certain community of cognitions, which consists in this,
3494: that they mutually exclude each other, yet thereby determine, as a
3495: whole, the true cognition, inasmuch as, taken together, they make up
3496: the complete content of a particular given cognition. And this is all
3497: that I find necessary, for the sake of what follows, to remark in this
3498: place.
3499: 
3500: 4. The modality of judgements is a quite peculiar function, with this
3501: distinguishing characteristic, that it contributes nothing to the
3502: content of a judgement (for besides quantity, quality, and relation,
3503: there is nothing more that constitutes the content of a judgement), but
3504: concerns itself only with the value of the copula in relation to
3505: thought in general. Problematical judgements are those in which the
3506: affirmation or negation is accepted as merely possible (ad libitum). In
3507: the assertorical, we regard the proposition as real (true); in the
3508: apodeictical, we look on it as necessary.[13] Thus the two judgements
3509: (antecedens et consequens), the relation of which constitutes a
3510: hypothetical judgement, likewise those (the members of the division) in
3511: whose reciprocity the disjunctive consists, are only problematical. In
3512: the example above given the proposition, “There exists perfect
3513: justice,” is not stated assertorically, but as an ad libitum judgement,
3514: which someone may choose to adopt, and the consequence alone is
3515: assertorical. Hence such judgements may be obviously false, and yet,
3516: taken problematically, be conditions of our cognition of the truth.
3517: Thus the proposition, “The world exists only by blind chance,” is in
3518: the disjunctive judgement of problematical import only: that is to say,
3519: one may accept it for the moment, and it helps us (like the indication
3520: of the wrong road among all the roads that one can take) to find out
3521: the true proposition. The problematical proposition is, therefore, that
3522: which expresses only logical possibility (which is not objective); that
3523: is, it expresses a free choice to admit the validity of such a
3524: proposition—a merely arbitrary reception of it into the understanding.
3525: The assertorical speaks of logical reality or truth; as, for example,
3526: in a hypothetical syllogism, the antecedens presents itself in a
3527: problematical form in the major, in an assertorical form in the minor,
3528: and it shows that the proposition is in harmony with the laws of the
3529: understanding. The apodeictical proposition cogitates the assertorical
3530: as determined by these very laws of the understanding, consequently as
3531: affirming à priori, and in this manner it expresses logical necessity.
3532: Now because all is here gradually incorporated with the
3533: understanding—inasmuch as in the first place we judge problematically;
3534: then accept assertorically our judgement as true; lastly, affirm it as
3535: inseparably united with the understanding, that is, as necessary and
3536: apodeictical—we may safely reckon these three functions of modality as
3537: so many momenta of thought.
3538: 
3539:  [13] Just as if thought were in the first instance a function of the
3540:  understanding; in the second, of judgement; in the third, of reason. A
3541:  remark which will be explained in the sequel.
3542: 
3543: Section III. Of the Pure Conceptions of the Understanding, or
3544: Categories § 6
3545: 
3546: General logic, as has been repeatedly said, makes abstraction of all
3547: content of cognition, and expects to receive representations from some
3548: other quarter, in order, by means of analysis, to convert them into
3549: conceptions. On the contrary, transcendental logic has lying before it
3550: the manifold content of à priori sensibility, which transcendental
3551: æsthetic presents to it in order to give matter to the pure conceptions
3552: of the understanding, without which transcendental logic would have no
3553: content, and be therefore utterly void. Now space and time contain an
3554: infinite diversity of determinations of pure à priori intuition, but
3555: are nevertheless the condition of the mind’s receptivity, under which
3556: alone it can obtain representations of objects, and which,
3557: consequently, must always affect the conception of these objects. But
3558: the spontaneity of thought requires that this diversity be examined
3559: after a certain manner, received into the mind, and connected, in order
3560: afterwards to form a cognition out of it. This Process I call
3561: synthesis.
3562: 
3563: By the word synthesis, in its most general signification, I understand
3564: the process of joining different representations to each other and of
3565: comprehending their diversity in one cognition. This synthesis is pure
3566: when the diversity is not given empirically but à priori (as that in
3567: space and time). Our representations must be given previously to any
3568: analysis of them; and no conceptions can arise, quoad their content,
3569: analytically. But the synthesis of a diversity (be it given à priori or
3570: empirically) is the first requisite for the production of a cognition,
3571: which in its beginning, indeed, may be crude and confused, and
3572: therefore in need of analysis—still, synthesis is that by which alone
3573: the elements of our cognitions are collected and united into a certain
3574: content, consequently it is the first thing on which we must fix our
3575: attention, if we wish to investigate the origin of our knowledge.
3576: 
3577: Synthesis, generally speaking, is, as we shall afterwards see, the mere
3578: operation of the imagination—a blind but indispensable function of the
3579: soul, without which we should have no cognition whatever, but of the
3580: working of which we are seldom even conscious. But to reduce this
3581: synthesis to conceptions is a function of the understanding, by means
3582: of which we attain to cognition, in the proper meaning of the term.
3583: 
3584: Pure synthesis, represented generally, gives us the pure conception of
3585: the understanding. But by this pure synthesis, I mean that which rests
3586: upon a basis of à priori synthetical unity. Thus, our numeration (and
3587: this is more observable in large numbers) is a synthesis according to
3588: conceptions, because it takes place according to a common basis of
3589: unity (for example, the decade). By means of this conception,
3590: therefore, the unity in the synthesis of the manifold becomes
3591: necessary.
3592: 
3593: By means of analysis different representations are brought under one
3594: conception—an operation of which general logic treats. On the other
3595: hand, the duty of transcendental logic is to reduce to conceptions, not
3596: representations, but the pure synthesis of representations. The first
3597: thing which must be given to us for the sake of the à priori cognition
3598: of all objects, is the diversity of the pure intuition; the synthesis
3599: of this diversity by means of the imagination is the second; but this
3600: gives, as yet, no cognition. The conceptions which give unity to this
3601: pure synthesis, and which consist solely in the representation of this
3602: necessary synthetical unity, furnish the third requisite for the
3603: cognition of an object, and these conceptions are given by the
3604: understanding.
3605: 
3606: The same function which gives unity to the different representation in
3607: a judgement, gives also unity to the mere synthesis of different
3608: representations in an intuition; and this unity we call the pure
3609: conception of the understanding. Thus, the same understanding, and by
3610: the same operations, whereby in conceptions, by means of analytical
3611: unity, it produced the logical form of a judgement, introduces, by
3612: means of the synthetical unity of the manifold in intuition, a
3613: transcendental content into its representations, on which account they
3614: are called pure conceptions of the understanding, and they apply à
3615: priori to objects, a result not within the power of general logic.
3616: 
3617: In this manner, there arise exactly so many pure conceptions of the
3618: understanding, applying à priori to objects of intuition in general, as
3619: there are logical functions in all possible judgements. For there is no
3620: other function or faculty existing in the understanding besides those
3621: enumerated in that table. These conceptions we shall, with Aristotle,
3622: call categories, our purpose being originally identical with his,
3623: notwithstanding the great difference in the execution.

3645: 
3646: This, then, is a catalogue of all the originally pure conceptions of
3647: the synthesis which the understanding contains à priori, and these
3648: conceptions alone entitle it to be called a pure understanding;
3649: inasmuch as only by them it can render the manifold of intuition
3650: conceivable, in other words, think an object of intuition. This
3651: division is made systematically from a common principle, namely the
3652: faculty of judgement (which is just the same as the power of thought),
3653: and has not arisen rhapsodically from a search at haphazard after pure
3654: conceptions, respecting the full number of which we never could be
3655: certain, inasmuch as we employ induction alone in our search, without
3656: considering that in this way we can never understand wherefore
3657: precisely these conceptions, and none others, abide in the pure
3658: understanding. It was a design worthy of an acute thinker like
3659: Aristotle, to search for these fundamental conceptions. Destitute,
3660: however, of any guiding principle, he picked them up just as they
3661: occurred to him, and at first hunted out ten, which he called
3662: categories (predicaments). Afterwards be believed that he had
3663: discovered five others, which were added under the name of post
3664: predicaments. But his catalogue still remained defective. Besides,
3665: there are to be found among them some of the modes of pure sensibility
3666: (quando, ubi, situs, also prius, simul), and likewise an empirical
3667: conception (motus)—which can by no means belong to this genealogical
3668: register of the pure understanding. Moreover, there are deduced
3669: conceptions (actio, passio) enumerated among the original conceptions,
3670: and, of the latter, some are entirely wanting.
3671: 
3672: With regard to these, it is to be remarked, that the categories, as the
3673: true primitive conceptions of the pure understanding, have also their
3674: pure deduced conceptions, which, in a complete system of transcendental
3675: philosophy, must by no means be passed over; though in a merely
3676: critical essay we must be contented with the simple mention of the
3677: fact.
3678: 
3679: Let it be allowed me to call these pure, but deduced conceptions of the
3680: understanding, the predicables of the pure understanding, in
3681: contradistinction to predicaments. If we are in possession of the
3682: original and primitive, the deduced and subsidiary conceptions can
3683: easily be added, and the genealogical tree of the understanding
3684: completely delineated. As my present aim is not to set forth a complete
3685: system, but merely the principles of one, I reserve this task for
3686: another time. It may be easily executed by any one who will refer to
3687: the ontological manuals, and subordinate to the category of causality,
3688: for example, the predicables of force, action, passion; to that of
3689: community, those of presence and resistance; to the categories of
3690: modality, those of origination, extinction, change; and so with the
3691: rest. The categories combined with the modes of pure sensibility, or
3692: with one another, afford a great number of deduced à priori
3693: conceptions; a complete enumeration of which would be a useful and not
3694: unpleasant, but in this place a perfectly dispensable, occupation.
3695: 
3696: I purposely omit the definitions of the categories in this treatise. I
3697: shall analyse these conceptions only so far as is necessary for the
3698: doctrine of method, which is to form a part of this critique. In a
3699: system of pure reason, definitions of them would be with justice
3700: demanded of me, but to give them here would only bide from our view the
3701: main aim of our investigation, at the same time raising doubts and
3702: objections, the consideration of which, without injustice to our main
3703: purpose, may be very well postponed till another opportunity.
3704: Meanwhile, it ought to be sufficiently clear, from the little we have
3705: already said on this subject, that the formation of a complete
3706: vocabulary of pure conceptions, accompanied by all the requisite
3707: explanations, is not only a possible, but an easy undertaking. The
3708: compartments already exist; it is only necessary to fill them up; and a
3709: systematic topic like the present, indicates with perfect precision the
3710: proper place to which each conception belongs, while it readily points
3711: out any that have not yet been filled up.
3712: 
3713: § 7
3714: 
3715: 
3716: Our table of the categories suggests considerations of some importance,
3717: which may perhaps have significant results in regard to the scientific
3718: form of all rational cognitions. For, that this table is useful in the
3719: theoretical part of philosophy, nay, indispensable for the sketching of
3720: the complete plan of a science, so far as that science rests upon
3721: conceptions à priori, and for dividing it mathematically, according to
3722: fixed principles, is most manifest from the fact that it contains all
3723: the elementary conceptions of the understanding, nay, even the form of
3724: a system of these in the understanding itself, and consequently
3725: indicates all the momenta, and also the internal arrangement of a
3726: projected speculative science, as I have elsewhere shown.[14] Here
3727: follow some of these observations.
3728: 
3729:  [14] In the “Metaphysical Principles of Natural Science.”
3730: 
3731: 
3732: I. This table, which contains four classes of conceptions of the
3733: understanding, may, in the first instance, be divided into two classes,
3734: the first of which relates to objects of intuition—pure as well as
3735: empirical; the second, to the existence of these objects, either in
3736: relation to one another, or to the understanding.
3737: 
3738: The former of these classes of categories I would entitle the
3739: mathematical, and the latter the dynamical categories. The former, as
3740: we see, has no correlates; these are only to be found in the second
3741: class. This difference must have a ground in the nature of the human
3742: understanding.
3743: 
3744: II. The number of the categories in each class is always the same,
3745: namely, three—a fact which also demands some consideration, because in
3746: all other cases division à priori through conceptions is necessarily
3747: dichotomy. It is to be added, that the third category in each triad
3748: always arises from the combination of the second with the first.
3749: 
3750: Thus totality is nothing else but plurality contemplated as unity;
3751: limitation is merely reality conjoined with negation; community is the
3752: causality of a substance, reciprocally determining, and determined by
3753: other substances; and finally, necessity is nothing but existence,
3754: which is given through the possibility itself. Let it not be supposed,
3755: however, that the third category is merely a deduced, and not a
3756: primitive conception of the pure understanding. For the conjunction of
3757: the first and second, in order to produce the third conception,
3758: requires a particular function of the understanding, which is by no
3759: means identical with those which are exercised in the first and second.
3760: Thus, the conception of a number (which belongs to the category of
3761: totality) is not always possible, where the conceptions of multitude
3762: and unity exist (for example, in the representation of the infinite).
3763: Or, if I conjoin the conception of a cause with that of a substance, it
3764: does not follow that the conception of influence, that is, how one
3765: substance can be the cause of something in another substance, will be
3766: understood from that. Thus it is evident that a particular act of the
3767: understanding is here necessary; and so in the other instances.
3768: 
3769: III. With respect to one category, namely, that of community, which is
3770: found in the third class, it is not so easy as with the others to
3771: detect its accordance with the form of the disjunctive judgement which
3772: corresponds to it in the table of the logical functions.
3773: 
3774: In order to assure ourselves of this accordance, we must observe that
3775: in every disjunctive judgement, the sphere of the judgement (that is,
3776: the complex of all that is contained in it) is represented as a whole
3777: divided into parts; and, since one part cannot be contained in the
3778: other, they are cogitated as co-ordinated with, not subordinated to
3779: each other, so that they do not determine each other unilaterally, as
3780: in a linear series, but reciprocally, as in an aggregate—(if one member
3781: of the division is posited, all the rest are excluded; and conversely).
3782: 
3783: Now a like connection is cogitated in a whole of things; for one thing
3784: is not subordinated, as effect, to another as cause of its existence,
3785: but, on the contrary, is co-ordinated contemporaneously and
3786: reciprocally, as a cause in relation to the determination of the others
3787: (for example, in a body—the parts of which mutually attract and repel
3788: each other). And this is an entirely different kind of connection from
3789: that which we find in the mere relation of the cause to the effect (the
3790: principle to the consequence), for in such a connection the consequence
3791: does not in its turn determine the principle, and therefore does not
3792: constitute, with the latter, a whole—just as the Creator does not with
3793: the world make up a whole. The process of understanding by which it
3794: represents to itself the sphere of a divided conception, is employed
3795: also when we think of a thing as divisible; and in the same manner as
3796: the members of the division in the former exclude one another, and yet
3797: are connected in one sphere, so the understanding represents to itself
3798: the parts of the latter, as having—each of them—an existence (as
3799: substances), independently of the others, and yet as united in one
3800: whole.
3801: 
3802: § 8
3803: 
3804: 
3805: In the transcendental philosophy of the ancients there exists one more
3806: leading division, which contains pure conceptions of the understanding,
3807: and which, although not numbered among the categories, ought, according
3808: to them, as conceptions à priori, to be valid of objects. But in this
3809: case they would augment the number of the categories; which cannot be.
3810: These are set forth in the proposition, so renowned among the
3811: schoolmen—‘_Quodlibet ens est UNUM, VERUM, BONUM_.’ Now, though the
3812: inferences from this principle were mere tautological propositions, and
3813: though it is allowed only by courtesy to retain a place in modern
3814: metaphysics, yet a thought which maintained itself for such a length of
3815: time, however empty it seems to be, deserves an investigation of its
3816: origin, and justifies the conjecture that it must be grounded in some
3817: law of the understanding, which, as is often the case, has only been
3818: erroneously interpreted. These pretended transcendental predicates are,
3819: in fact, nothing but logical requisites and criteria of all cognition
3820: of objects, and they employ, as the basis for this cognition, the
3821: categories of quantity, namely, unity, plurality, and totality. But
3822: these, which must be taken as material conditions, that is, as
3823: belonging to the possibility of things themselves, they employed merely
3824: in a formal signification, as belonging to the logical requisites of
3825: all cognition, and yet most unguardedly changed these criteria of
3826: thought into properties of objects, as things in themselves. Now, in
3827: every cognition of an object, there is unity of conception, which may
3828: be called qualitative unity, so far as by this term we understand only
3829: the unity in our connection of the manifold; for example, unity of the
3830: theme in a play, an oration, or a story. Secondly, there is truth in
3831: respect of the deductions from it. The more true deductions we have
3832: from a given conception, the more criteria of its objective reality.
3833: This we might call the qualitative plurality of characteristic marks,
3834: which belong to a conception as to a common foundation, but are not
3835: cogitated as a quantity in it. Thirdly, there is perfection—which
3836: consists in this, that the plurality falls back upon the unity of the
3837: conception, and accords completely with that conception and with no
3838: other. This we may denominate qualitative completeness. Hence it is
3839: evident that these logical criteria of the possibility of cognition are
3840: merely the three categories of quantity modified and transformed to
3841: suit an unauthorized manner of applying them. That is to say, the three
3842: categories, in which the unity in the production of the quantum must be
3843: homogeneous throughout, are transformed solely with a view to the
3844: connection of heterogeneous parts of cognition in one act of
3845: consciousness, by means of the quality of the cognition, which is the
3846: principle of that connection. Thus the criterion of the possibility of
3847: a conception (not of its object) is the definition of it, in which the
3848: unity of the conception, the truth of all that may be immediately
3849: deduced from it, and finally, the completeness of what has been thus
3850: deduced, constitute the requisites for the reproduction of the whole
3851: conception. Thus also, the criterion or test of an hypothesis is the
3852: intelligibility of the received principle of explanation, or its unity
3853: (without help from any subsidiary hypothesis)—the truth of our
3854: deductions from it (consistency with each other and with
3855: experience)—and lastly, the completeness of the principle of the
3856: explanation of these deductions, which refer to neither more nor less
3857: than what was admitted in the hypothesis, restoring analytically and à
3858: posteriori, what was cogitated synthetically and à priori. By the
3859: conceptions, therefore, of unity, truth, and perfection, we have made
3860: no addition to the transcendental table of the categories, which is
3861: complete without them. We have, on the contrary, merely employed the
3862: three categories of quantity, setting aside their application to
3863: objects of experience, as general logical laws of the consistency of
3864: cognition with itself.

3866: Chapter II. Of the Deduction of the Pure Conceptions of the
3867: Understanding
3868: 
3869: Section I. Of the Principles of a Transcendental Deduction in general §
3870: 9
3871: 
3872: Teachers of jurisprudence, when speaking of rights and claims,
3873: distinguish in a cause the question of right (quid juris) from the
3874: question of fact (quid facti), and while they demand proof of both,
3875: they give to the proof of the former, which goes to establish right or
3876: claim in law, the name of deduction. Now we make use of a great number
3877: of empirical conceptions, without opposition from any one; and consider
3878: ourselves, even without any attempt at deduction, justified in
3879: attaching to them a sense, and a supposititious signification, because
3880: we have always experience at hand to demonstrate their objective
3881: reality. There exist also, however, usurped conceptions, such as
3882: fortune, fate, which circulate with almost universal indulgence, and
3883: yet are occasionally challenged by the question, “quid juris?” In such
3884: cases, we have great difficulty in discovering any deduction for these
3885: terms, inasmuch as we cannot produce any manifest ground of right,
3886: either from experience or from reason, on which the claim to employ
3887: them can be founded.
3888: 
3889: Among the many conceptions, which make up the very variegated web of
3890: human cognition, some are destined for pure use à priori, independent
3891: of all experience; and their title to be so employed always requires a
3892: deduction, inasmuch as, to justify such use of them, proofs from
3893: experience are not sufficient; but it is necessary to know how these
3894: conceptions can apply to objects without being derived from experience.
3895: I term, therefore, an examination of the manner in which conceptions
3896: can apply à priori to objects, the transcendental deduction of
3897: conceptions, and I distinguish it from the empirical deduction, which
3898: indicates the mode in which conception is obtained through experience
3899: and reflection thereon; consequently, does not concern itself with the
3900: right, but only with the fact of our obtaining conceptions in such and
3901: such a manner. We have already seen that we are in possession of two
3902: perfectly different kinds of conceptions, which nevertheless agree with
3903: each other in this, that they both apply to objects completely à
3904: priori. These are the conceptions of space and time as forms of
3905: sensibility, and the categories as pure conceptions of the
3906: understanding. To attempt an empirical deduction of either of these
3907: classes would be labour in vain, because the distinguishing
3908: characteristic of their nature consists in this, that they apply to
3909: their objects, without having borrowed anything from experience towards
3910: the representation of them. Consequently, if a deduction of these
3911: conceptions is necessary, it must always be transcendental.
3912: 
3913: Meanwhile, with respect to these conceptions, as with respect to all
3914: our cognition, we certainly may discover in experience, if not the
3915: principle of their possibility, yet the occasioning causes of their
3916: production. It will be found that the impressions of sense give the
3917: first occasion for bringing into action the whole faculty of cognition,
3918: and for the production of experience, which contains two very
3919: dissimilar elements, namely, a matter for cognition, given by the
3920: senses, and a certain form for the arrangement of this matter, arising
3921: out of the inner fountain of pure intuition and thought; and these, on
3922: occasion given by sensuous impressions, are called into exercise and
3923: produce conceptions. Such an investigation into the first efforts of
3924: our faculty of cognition to mount from particular perceptions to
3925: general conceptions is undoubtedly of great utility; and we have to
3926: thank the celebrated Locke for having first opened the way for this
3927: inquiry. But a deduction of the pure à priori conceptions of course
3928: never can be made in this way, seeing that, in regard to their future
3929: employment, which must be entirely independent of experience, they must
3930: have a far different certificate of birth to show from that of a
3931: descent from experience. This attempted physiological derivation, which
3932: cannot properly be called deduction, because it relates merely to a
3933: quaestio facti, I shall entitle an explanation of the possession of a
3934: pure cognition. It is therefore manifest that there can only be a
3935: transcendental deduction of these conceptions and by no means an
3936: empirical one; also, that all attempts at an empirical deduction, in
3937: regard to pure à priori conceptions, are vain, and can only be made by
3938: one who does not understand the altogether peculiar nature of these
3939: cognitions.
3940: 
3941: But although it is admitted that the only possible deduction of pure à
3942: priori cognition is a transcendental deduction, it is not, for that
3943: reason, perfectly manifest that such a deduction is absolutely
3944: necessary. We have already traced to their sources the conceptions of
3945: space and time, by means of a transcendental deduction, and we have
3946: explained and determined their objective validity à priori. Geometry,
3947: nevertheless, advances steadily and securely in the province of pure à
3948: priori cognitions, without needing to ask from philosophy any
3949: certificate as to the pure and legitimate origin of its fundamental
3950: conception of space. But the use of the conception in this science
3951: extends only to the external world of sense, the pure form of the
3952: intuition of which is space; and in this world, therefore, all
3953: geometrical cognition, because it is founded upon à priori intuition,
3954: possesses immediate evidence, and the objects of this cognition are
3955: given à priori (as regards their form) in intuition by and through the
3956: cognition itself. With the pure conceptions of understanding, on the
3957: contrary, commences the absolute necessity of seeking a transcendental
3958: deduction, not only of these conceptions themselves, but likewise of
3959: space, because, inasmuch as they make affirmations concerning objects
3960: not by means of the predicates of intuition and sensibility, but of
3961: pure thought à priori, they apply to objects without any of the
3962: conditions of sensibility. Besides, not being founded on experience,
3963: they are not presented with any object in à priori intuition upon
3964: which, antecedently to experience, they might base their synthesis.
3965: Hence results, not only doubt as to the objective validity and proper
3966: limits of their use, but that even our conception of space is rendered
3967: equivocal; inasmuch as we are very ready with the aid of the
3968: categories, to carry the use of this conception beyond the conditions
3969: of sensuous intuition—and, for this reason, we have already found a
3970: transcendental deduction of it needful. The reader, then, must be quite
3971: convinced of the absolute necessity of a transcendental deduction,
3972: before taking a single step in the field of pure reason; because
3973: otherwise he goes to work blindly, and after he has wondered about in
3974: all directions, returns to the state of utter ignorance from which he
3975: started. He ought, moreover, clearly to recognize beforehand the
3976: unavoidable difficulties in his undertaking, so that he may not
3977: afterwards complain of the obscurity in which the subject itself is
3978: deeply involved, or become too soon impatient of the obstacles in his
3979: path; because we have a choice of only two things—either at once to
3980: give up all pretensions to knowledge beyond the limits of possible
3981: experience, or to bring this critical investigation to completion.
3982: 
3983: We have been able, with very little trouble, to make it comprehensible
3984: how the conceptions of space and time, although à priori cognitions,
3985: must necessarily apply to external objects, and render a synthetical
3986: cognition of these possible, independently of all experience. For
3987: inasmuch as only by means of such pure form of sensibility an object
3988: can appear to us, that is, be an object of empirical intuition, space
3989: and time are pure intuitions, which contain à priori the condition of
3990: the possibility of objects as phenomena, and an à priori synthesis in
3991: these intuitions possesses objective validity.
3992: 
3993: On the other hand, the categories of the understanding do not represent
3994: the conditions under which objects are given to us in intuition;
3995: objects can consequently appear to us without necessarily connecting
3996: themselves with these, and consequently without any necessity binding
3997: on the understanding to contain à priori the conditions of these
3998: objects. Thus we find ourselves involved in a difficulty which did not
3999: present itself in the sphere of sensibility, that is to say, we cannot
4000: discover how the subjective conditions of thought can have objective
4001: validity, in other words, can become conditions of the possibility of
4002: all cognition of objects; for phenomena may certainly be given to us in
4003: intuition without any help from the functions of the understanding. Let
4004: us take, for example, the conception of cause, which indicates a
4005: peculiar kind of synthesis, namely, that with something, A, something
4006: entirely different, B, is connected according to a law. It is not à
4007: priori manifest why phenomena should contain anything of this kind (we
4008: are of course debarred from appealing for proof to experience, for the
4009: objective validity of this conception must be demonstrated à priori),
4010: and it hence remains doubtful à priori, whether such a conception be
4011: not quite void and without any corresponding object among phenomena.
4012: For that objects of sensuous intuition must correspond to the formal
4013: conditions of sensibility existing à priori in the mind is quite
4014: evident, from the fact that without these they could not be objects for
4015: us; but that they must also correspond to the conditions which
4016: understanding requires for the synthetical unity of thought is an
4017: assertion, the grounds for which are not so easily to be discovered.
4018: For phenomena might be so constituted as not to correspond to the
4019: conditions of the unity of thought; and all things might lie in such
4020: confusion that, for example, nothing could be met with in the sphere of
4021: phenomena to suggest a law of synthesis, and so correspond to the
4022: conception of cause and effect; so that this conception would be quite
4023: void, null, and without significance. Phenomena would nevertheless
4024: continue to present objects to our intuition; for mere intuition does
4025: not in any respect stand in need of the functions of thought.
4026: 
4027: If we thought to free ourselves from the labour of these investigations
4028: by saying: “Experience is constantly offering us examples of the
4029: relation of cause and effect in phenomena, and presents us with
4030: abundant opportunity of abstracting the conception of cause, and so at
4031: the same time of corroborating the objective validity of this
4032: conception”; we should in this case be overlooking the fact, that the
4033: conception of cause cannot arise in this way at all; that, on the
4034: contrary, it must either have an à priori basis in the understanding,
4035: or be rejected as a mere chimera. For this conception demands that
4036: something, A, should be of such a nature that something else, B, should
4037: follow from it necessarily, and according to an absolutely universal
4038: law. We may certainly collect from phenomena a law, according to which
4039: this or that usually happens, but the element of necessity is not to be
4040: found in it. Hence it is evident that to the synthesis of cause and
4041: effect belongs a dignity, which is utterly wanting in any empirical
4042: synthesis; for it is no mere mechanical synthesis, by means of
4043: addition, but a dynamical one; that is to say, the effect is not to be
4044: cogitated as merely annexed to the cause, but as posited by and through
4045: the cause, and resulting from it. The strict universality of this law
4046: never can be a characteristic of empirical laws, which obtain through
4047: induction only a comparative universality, that is, an extended range
4048: of practical application. But the pure conceptions of the understanding
4049: would entirely lose all their peculiar character, if we treated them
4050: merely as the productions of experience.
4051: 
4052: Transition to the Transcendental Deduction of the Categories § 10
4053: 
4054: There are only two possible ways in which synthetical representation
4055: and its objects can coincide with and relate necessarily to each other,
4056: and, as it were, meet together. Either the object alone makes the
4057: representation possible, or the representation alone makes the object
4058: possible. In the former case, the relation between them is only
4059: empirical, and an à priori representation is impossible. And this is
4060: the case with phenomena, as regards that in them which is referable to
4061: mere sensation. In the latter case—although representation alone (for
4062: of its causality, by means of the will, we do not here speak) does not
4063: produce the object as to its existence, it must nevertheless be à
4064: priori determinative in regard to the object, if it is only by means of
4065: the representation that we can cognize anything as an object. Now there
4066: are only two conditions of the possibility of a cognition of objects;
4067: firstly, intuition, by means of which the object, though only as
4068: phenomenon, is given; secondly, conception, by means of which the
4069: object which corresponds to this intuition is thought. But it is
4070: evident from what has been said on æsthetic that the first condition,
4071: under which alone objects can be intuited, must in fact exist, as a
4072: formal basis for them, à priori in the mind. With this formal condition
4073: of sensibility, therefore, all phenomena necessarily correspond,
4074: because it is only through it that they can be phenomena at all; that
4075: is, can be empirically intuited and given. Now the question is whether
4076: there do not exist, à priori in the mind, conceptions of understanding
4077: also, as conditions under which alone something, if not intuited, is
4078: yet thought as object. If this question be answered in the affirmative,
4079: it follows that all empirical cognition of objects is necessarily
4080: conformable to such conceptions, since, if they are not presupposed, it
4081: is impossible that anything can be an object of experience. Now all
4082: experience contains, besides the intuition of the senses through which
4083: an object is given, a conception also of an object that is given in
4084: intuition. Accordingly, conceptions of objects in general must lie as à
4085: priori conditions at the foundation of all empirical cognition; and
4086: consequently, the objective validity of the categories, as à priori
4087: conceptions, will rest upon this, that experience (as far as regards
4088: the form of thought) is possible only by their means. For in that case
4089: they apply necessarily and à priori to objects of experience, because
4090: only through them can an object of experience be thought.
4091: 
4092: The whole aim of the transcendental deduction of all à priori
4093: conceptions is to show that these conceptions are à priori conditions
4094: of the possibility of all experience. Conceptions which afford us the
4095: objective foundation of the possibility of experience are for that very
4096: reason necessary. But the analysis of the experiences in which they are
4097: met with is not deduction, but only an illustration of them, because
4098: from experience they could never derive the attribute of necessity.
4099: Without their original applicability and relation to all possible
4100: experience, in which all objects of cognition present themselves, the
4101: relation of the categories to objects, of whatever nature, would be
4102: quite incomprehensible.
4103: 
4104: The celebrated Locke, for want of due reflection on these points, and
4105: because he met with pure conceptions of the understanding in
4106: experience, sought also to deduce them from experience, and yet
4107: proceeded so inconsequently as to attempt, with their aid, to arrive it
4108: cognitions which lie far beyond the limits of all experience. David
4109: Hume perceived that, to render this possible, it was necessary that the
4110: conceptions should have an à priori origin. But as he could not explain
4111: how it was possible that conceptions which are not connected with each
4112: other in the understanding must nevertheless be thought as necessarily
4113: connected in the object—and it never occurred to him that the
4114: understanding itself might, perhaps, by means of these conceptions, be
4115: the author of the experience in which its objects were presented to
4116: it—he was forced to drive these conceptions from experience, that is,
4117: from a subjective necessity arising from repeated association of
4118: experiences erroneously considered to be objective—in one word, from
4119: habit. But he proceeded with perfect consequence and declared it to be
4120: impossible, with such conceptions and the principles arising from them,
4121: to overstep the limits of experience. The empirical derivation,
4122: however, which both of these philosophers attributed to these
4123: conceptions, cannot possibly be reconciled with the fact that we do
4124: possess scientific à priori cognitions, namely, those of pure
4125: mathematics and general physics.
4126: 
4127: The former of these two celebrated men opened a wide door to
4128: extravagance—(for if reason has once undoubted right on its side, it
4129: will not allow itself to be confined to set limits, by vague
4130: recommendations of moderation); the latter gave himself up entirely to
4131: scepticism—a natural consequence, after having discovered, as he
4132: thought, that the faculty of cognition was not trustworthy. We now
4133: intend to make a trial whether it be not possible safely to conduct
4134: reason between these two rocks, to assign her determinate limits, and
4135: yet leave open for her the entire sphere of her legitimate activity.
4136: 
4137: I shall merely premise an explanation of what the categories are. They
4138: are conceptions of an object in general, by means of which its
4139: intuition is contemplated as determined in relation to one of the
4140: logical functions of judgement. The following will make this plain. The
4141: function of the categorical judgement is that of the relation of
4142: subject to predicate; for example, in the proposition: “All bodies are
4143: divisible.” But in regard to the merely logical use of the
4144: understanding, it still remains undetermined to which Of these two
4145: conceptions belongs the function Of subject and to which that of
4146: predicate. For we could also say: “Some divisible is a body.” But the
4147: category of substance, when the conception of a body is brought under
4148: it, determines that; and its empirical intuition in experience must be
4149: contemplated always as subject and never as mere predicate. And so with
4150: all the other categories.
4151: 
4152: Section II Transcendental Deduction of the pure Conceptions of the
4153: Understanding
4154: 
4155: Of the Possibility of a Conjunction of the manifold representations
4156: given by Sense § 11.
4157: 
4158: The manifold content in our representations can be given in an
4159: intuition which is merely sensuous—in other words, is nothing but
4160: susceptibility; and the form of this intuition can exist à priori in
4161: our faculty of representation, without being anything else but the mode
4162: in which the subject is affected. But the conjunction (conjunctio) of a
4163: manifold in intuition never can be given us by the senses; it cannot
4164: therefore be contained in the pure form of sensuous intuition, for it
4165: is a spontaneous act of the faculty of representation. And as we must,
4166: to distinguish it from sensibility, entitle this faculty understanding;
4167: so all conjunction whether conscious or unconscious, be it of the
4168: manifold in intuition, sensuous or non-sensuous, or of several
4169: conceptions—is an act of the understanding. To this act we shall give
4170: the general appellation of synthesis, thereby to indicate, at the same
4171: time, that we cannot represent anything as conjoined in the object
4172: without having previously conjoined it ourselves. Of all mental
4173: notions, that of conjunction is the only one which cannot be given
4174: through objects, but can be originated only by the subject itself,
4175: because it is an act of its purely spontaneous activity. The reader
4176: will easily enough perceive that the possibility of conjunction must be
4177: grounded in the very nature of this act, and that it must be equally
4178: valid for all conjunction, and that analysis, which appears to be its
4179: contrary, must, nevertheless, always presuppose it; for where the
4180: understanding has not previously conjoined, it cannot dissect or
4181: analyse, because only as conjoined by it, must that which is to be
4182: analysed have been given to our faculty of representation.
4183: 
4184: But the conception of conjunction includes, besides the conception of
4185: the manifold and of the synthesis of it, that of the unity of it also.
4186: Conjunction is the representation of the synthetical unity of the
4187: manifold.[15] This idea of unity, therefore, cannot arise out of that
4188: of conjunction; much rather does that idea, by combining itself with
4189: the representation of the manifold, render the conception of
4190: conjunction possible. This unity, which à priori precedes all
4191: conceptions of conjunction, is not the category of unity (§ 6); for all
4192: the categories are based upon logical functions of judgement, and in
4193: these functions we already have conjunction, and consequently unity of
4194: given conceptions. It is therefore evident that the category of unity
4195: presupposes conjunction. We must therefore look still higher for this
4196: unity (as qualitative, § 8), in that, namely, which contains the ground
4197: of the unity of diverse conceptions in judgements, the ground,
4198: consequently, of the possibility of the existence of the understanding,
4199: even in regard to its logical use.
4200: 
4201:  [15] Whether the representations are in themselves identical, and
4202:  consequently whether one can be thought analytically by means of and
4203:  through the other, is a question which we need not at present
4204:  consider. Our Consciousness of the one, when we speak of the manifold,
4205:  is always distinguishable from our consciousness of the other; and it
4206:  is only respecting the synthesis of this (possible) consciousness that
4207:  we here treat.
4208: 
4209: Of the Originally Synthetical Unity of Apperception § 12
4210: 
4211: The “I think” must accompany all my representations, for otherwise
4212: something would be represented in me which could not be thought; in
4213: other words, the representation would either be impossible, or at least
4214: be, in relation to me, nothing. That representation which can be given
4215: previously to all thought is called intuition. All the diversity or
4216: manifold content of intuition, has, therefore, a necessary relation to
4217: the “I think,” in the subject in which this diversity is found. But
4218: this representation, “I think,” is an act of spontaneity; that is to
4219: say, it cannot be regarded as belonging to mere sensibility. I call it
4220: pure apperception, in order to distinguish it from empirical; or
4221: primitive apperception, because it is self-consciousness which, whilst
4222: it gives birth to the representation “I think,” must necessarily be
4223: capable of accompanying all our representations. It is in all acts of
4224: consciousness one and the same, and unaccompanied by it, no
4225: representation can exist for me. The unity of this apperception I call
4226: the transcendental unity of self-consciousness, in order to indicate
4227: the possibility of à priori cognition arising from it. For the manifold
4228: representations which are given in an intuition would not all of them
4229: be my representations, if they did not all belong to one
4230: self-consciousness, that is, as my representations (even although I am
4231: not conscious of them as such), they must conform to the condition
4232: under which alone they can exist together in a common
4233: self-consciousness, because otherwise they would not all without
4234: exception belong to me. From this primitive conjunction follow many
4235: important results.
4236: 
4237: For example, this universal identity of the apperception of the
4238: manifold given in intuition contains a synthesis of representations and
4239: is possible only by means of the consciousness of this synthesis. For
4240: the empirical consciousness which accompanies different representations
4241: is in itself fragmentary and disunited, and without relation to the
4242: identity of the subject. This relation, then, does not exist because I
4243: accompany every representation with consciousness, but because I join
4244: one representation to another, and am conscious of the synthesis of
4245: them. Consequently, only because I can connect a variety of given
4246: representations in one consciousness, is it possible that I can
4247: represent to myself the identity of consciousness in these
4248: representations; in other words, the analytical unity of apperception
4249: is possible only under the presupposition of a synthetical unity.[16]
4250: The thought, “These representations given in intuition belong all of
4251: them to me,” is accordingly just the same as, “I unite them in one
4252: self-consciousness, or can at least so unite them”; and although this
4253: thought is not itself the consciousness of the synthesis of
4254: representations, it presupposes the possibility of it; that is to say,
4255: for the reason alone that I can comprehend the variety of my
4256: representations in one consciousness, do I call them my
4257: representations, for otherwise I must have as many-coloured and various
4258: a self as are the representations of which I am conscious. Synthetical
4259: unity of the manifold in intuitions, as given à priori, is therefore
4260: the foundation of the identity of apperception itself, which antecedes
4261: à priori all determinate thought. But the conjunction of
4262: representations into a conception is not to be found in objects
4263: themselves, nor can it be, as it were, borrowed from them and taken up
4264: into the understanding by perception, but it is on the contrary an
4265: operation of the understanding itself, which is nothing more than the
4266: faculty of conjoining à priori and of bringing the variety of given
4267: representations under the unity of apperception. This principle is the
4268: highest in all human cognition.
4269: 
4270:  [16] All general conceptions—as such—depend, for their existence, on
4271:  the analytical unity of consciousness. For example, when I think of
4272:  red in general, I thereby think to myself a property which (as a
4273:  characteristic mark) can be discovered somewhere, or can be united
4274:  with other representations; consequently, it is only by means of a
4275:  forethought possible synthetical unity that I can think to myself the
4276:  analytical. A representation which is cogitated as common to different
4277:  representations, is regarded as belonging to such as, besides this
4278:  common representation, contain something different; consequently it
4279:  must be previously thought in synthetical unity with other although
4280:  only possible representations, before I can think in it the analytical
4281:  unity of consciousness which makes it a conceptas communis. And thus
4282:  the synthetical unity of apperception is the highest point with which
4283:  we must connect every operation of the understanding, even the whole
4284:  of logic, and after it our transcendental philosophy; indeed, this
4285:  faculty is the understanding itself.
4286: 
4287: 
4288: This fundamental principle of the necessary unity of apperception is
4289: indeed an identical, and therefore analytical, proposition; but it
4290: nevertheless explains the necessity for a synthesis of the manifold
4291: given in an intuition, without which the identity of self-consciousness
4292: would be incogitable. For the ego, as a simple representation, presents
4293: us with no manifold content; only in intuition, which is quite
4294: different from the representation ego, can it be given us, and by means
4295: of conjunction it is cogitated in one self-consciousness. An
4296: understanding, in which all the manifold should be given by means of
4297: consciousness itself, would be intuitive; our understanding can only
4298: think and must look for its intuition to sense. I am, therefore,
4299: conscious of my identical self, in relation to all the variety of
4300: representations given to me in an intuition, because I call all of them
4301: my representations. In other words, I am conscious myself of a
4302: necessary à priori synthesis of my representations, which is called the
4303: original synthetical unity of apperception, under which rank all the
4304: representations presented to me, but that only by means of a synthesis.
4305: 
4306: The Principle of the Synthetical Unity of Apperception is the highest
4307: Principle of all exercise of the Understanding § 13
4308: 
4309: The supreme principle of the possibility of all intuition in relation
4310: to sensibility was, according to our transcendental æsthetic, that all
4311: the manifold in intuition be subject to the formal conditions of space
4312: and time. The supreme principle of the possibility of it in relation to
4313: the understanding is that all the manifold in it be subject to
4314: conditions of the originally synthetical unity or apperception.[17] To
4315: the former of these two principles are subject all the various
4316: representations of intuition, in so far as they are given to us; to the
4317: latter, in so far as they must be capable of conjunction in one
4318: consciousness; for without this nothing can be thought or cognized,
4319: because the given representations would not have in common the act Of
4320: the apperception “I think” and therefore could not be connected in one
4321: self-consciousness.
4322: 
4323:  [17] Space and time, and all portions thereof, are intuitions;
4324:  consequently are, with a manifold for their content, single
4325:  representations. (See the Transcendental Æsthetic.) Consequently, they
4326:  are not pure conceptions, by means of which the same consciousness is
4327:  found in a great number of representations; but, on the contrary, they
4328:  are many representations contained in one, the consciousness of which
4329:  is, so to speak, compounded. The unity of consciousness is
4330:  nevertheless synthetical and, therefore, primitive. From this peculiar
4331:  character of consciousness follow many important consequences. (See §
4332:  21.)
4333: 
4334: 
4335: Understanding is, to speak generally, the faculty Of cognitions. These
4336: consist in the determined relation of given representation to an
4337: object. But an object is that, in the conception of which the manifold
4338: in a given intuition is united. Now all union of representations
4339: requires unity of consciousness in the synthesis of them. Consequently,
4340: it is the unity of consciousness alone that constitutes the possibility
4341: of representations relating to an object, and therefore of their
4342: objective validity, and of their becoming cognitions, and consequently,
4343: the possibility of the existence of the understanding itself.
4344: 
4345: The first pure cognition of understanding, then, upon which is founded
4346: all its other exercise, and which is at the same time perfectly
4347: independent of all conditions of mere sensuous intuition, is the
4348: principle of the original synthetical unity of apperception. Thus the
4349: mere form of external sensuous intuition, namely, space, affords us,
4350: per se, no cognition; it merely contributes the manifold in à priori
4351: intuition to a possible cognition. But, in order to cognize something
4352: in space (for example, a line), I must draw it, and thus produce
4353: synthetically a determined conjunction of the given manifold, so that
4354: the unity of this act is at the same time the unity of consciousness
4355: (in the conception of a line), and by this means alone is an object (a
4356: determinate space) cognized. The synthetical unity of consciousness is,
4357: therefore, an objective condition of all cognition, which I do not
4358: merely require in order to cognize an object, but to which every
4359: intuition must necessarily be subject, in order to become an object for
4360: me; because in any other way, and without this synthesis, the manifold
4361: in intuition could not be united in one consciousness.
4362: 
4363: This proposition is, as already said, itself analytical, although it
4364: constitutes the synthetical unity, the condition of all thought; for it
4365: states nothing more than that all my representations in any given
4366: intuition must be subject to the condition which alone enables me to
4367: connect them, as my representation with the identical self, and so to
4368: unite them synthetically in one apperception, by means of the general
4369: expression, “I think.”
4370: 
4371: But this principle is not to be regarded as a principle for every
4372: possible understanding, but only for the understanding by means of
4373: whose pure apperception in the thought I am, no manifold content is
4374: given. The understanding or mind which contained the manifold in
4375: intuition, in and through the act itself of its own self-consciousness,
4376: in other words, an understanding by and in the representation of which
4377: the objects of the representation should at the same time exist, would
4378: not require a special act of synthesis of the manifold as the condition
4379: of the unity of its consciousness, an act of which the human
4380: understanding, which thinks only and cannot intuite, has absolute need.
4381: But this principle is the first principle of all the operations of our
4382: understanding, so that we cannot form the least conception of any other
4383: possible understanding, either of one such as should be itself
4384: intuition, or possess a sensuous intuition, but with forms different
4385: from those of space and time.
4386: 
4387: What Objective Unity of Self-consciousness is § 14
4388: 
4389: It is by means of the transcendental unity of apperception that all the
4390: manifold, given in an intuition is united into a conception of the
4391: object. On this account it is called objective, and must be
4392: distinguished from the subjective unity of consciousness, which is a
4393: determination of the internal sense, by means of which the said
4394: manifold in intuition is given empirically to be so united. Whether I
4395: can be empirically conscious of the manifold as coexistent or as
4396: successive, depends upon circumstances, or empirical conditions. Hence
4397: the empirical unity of consciousness by means of association of
4398: representations, itself relates to a phenomenal world and is wholly
4399: contingent. On the contrary, the pure form of intuition in time, merely
4400: as an intuition, which contains a given manifold, is subject to the
4401: original unity of consciousness, and that solely by means of the
4402: necessary relation of the manifold in intuition to the “I think,”
4403: consequently by means of the pure synthesis of the understanding, which
4404: lies à priori at the foundation of all empirical synthesis. The
4405: transcendental unity of apperception is alone objectively valid; the
4406: empirical which we do not consider in this essay, and which is merely a
4407: unity deduced from the former under given conditions in concreto,
4408: possesses only subjective validity. One person connects the notion
4409: conveyed in a word with one thing, another with another thing; and the
4410: unity of consciousness in that which is empirical, is, in relation to
4411: that which is given by experience, not necessarily and universally
4412: valid.
4413: 
4414: The Logical Form of all Judgements consists in the Objective Unity of
4415: Apperception of the Conceptions contained therein § 15
4416: 
4417: I could never satisfy myself with the definition which logicians give
4418: of a judgement. It is, according to them, the representation of a
4419: relation between two conceptions. I shall not dwell here on the
4420: faultiness of this definition, in that it suits only for categorical
4421: and not for hypothetical or disjunctive judgements, these latter
4422: containing a relation not of conceptions but of judgements themselves—a
4423: blunder from which many evil results have followed.[18] It is more
4424: important for our present purpose to observe, that this definition does
4425: not determine in what the said relation consists.
4426: 
4427:  [18] The tedious doctrine of the four syllogistic figures concerns
4428:  only categorical syllogisms; and although it is nothing more than an
4429:  artifice by surreptitiously introducing immediate conclusions
4430:  (consequentiae immediatae) among the premises of a pure syllogism, to
4431:  give ism give rise to an appearance of more modes of drawing a
4432:  conclusion than that in the first figure, the artifice would not have
4433:  had much success, had not its authors succeeded in bringing
4434:  categorical judgements into exclusive respect, as those to which all
4435:  others must be referred—a doctrine, however, which, according to § 5,
4436:  is utterly false.
4437: 
4438: 
4439: But if I investigate more closely the relation of given cognitions in
4440: every judgement, and distinguish it, as belonging to the understanding,
4441: from the relation which is produced according to laws of the
4442: reproductive imagination (which has only subjective validity), I find
4443: that judgement is nothing but the mode of bringing given cognitions
4444: under the objective unit of apperception. This is plain from our use of
4445: the term of relation is in judgements, in order to distinguish the
4446: objective unity of given representations from the subjective unity. For
4447: this term indicates the relation of these representations to the
4448: original apperception, and also their necessary unity, even although
4449: the judgement is empirical, therefore contingent, as in the judgement:
4450: “All bodies are heavy.” I do not mean by this, that these
4451: representations do necessarily belong to each other in empirical
4452: intuition, but that by means of the necessary unity of appreciation
4453: they belong to each other in the synthesis of intuitions, that is to
4454: say, they belong to each other according to principles of the objective
4455: determination of all our representations, in so far as cognition can
4456: arise from them, these principles being all deduced from the main
4457: principle of the transcendental unity of apperception. In this way
4458: alone can there arise from this relation a judgement, that is, a
4459: relation which has objective validity, and is perfectly distinct from
4460: that relation of the very same representations which has only
4461: subjective validity—a relation, to wit, which is produced according to
4462: laws of association. According to these laws, I could only say: “When I
4463: hold in my hand or carry a body, I feel an impression of weight”; but I
4464: could not say: “It, the body, is heavy”; for this is tantamount to
4465: saying both these representations are conjoined in the object, that is,
4466: without distinction as to the condition of the subject, and do not
4467: merely stand together in my perception, however frequently the
4468: perceptive act may be repeated.
4469: 
4470: All Sensuous Intuitions are subject to the Categories, as Conditions
4471: under which alone the manifold Content of them can be united in one
4472: Consciousness § 16
4473: 
4474: The manifold content given in a sensuous intuition comes necessarily
4475: under the original synthetical unity of apperception, because thereby
4476: alone is the unity of intuition possible (§ 13). But that act of the
4477: understanding, by which the manifold content of given representations
4478: (whether intuitions or conceptions) is brought under one apperception,
4479: is the logical function of judgements (§ 15). All the manifold,
4480: therefore, in so far as it is given in one empirical intuition, is
4481: determined in relation to one of the logical functions of judgement, by
4482: means of which it is brought into union in one consciousness. Now the
4483: categories are nothing else than these functions of judgement so far as
4484: the manifold in a given intuition is determined in relation to them (§
4485: 9). Consequently, the manifold in a given intuition is necessarily
4486: subject to the categories of the understanding.
4487: 
4488: Observation § 17
4489: 
4490: The manifold in an intuition, which I call mine, is represented by
4491: means of the synthesis of the understanding, as belonging to the
4492: necessary unity of self-consciousness, and this takes place by means of
4493: the category.[19] The category indicates accordingly that the empirical
4494: consciousness of a given manifold in an intuition is subject to a pure
4495: self-consciousness à priori, in the same manner as an empirical
4496: intuition is subject to a pure sensuous intuition, which is also à
4497: priori. In the above proposition, then, lies the beginning of a
4498: deduction of the pure conceptions of the understanding. Now, as the
4499: categories have their origin in the understanding alone, independently
4500: of sensibility, I must in my deduction make abstraction of the mode in
4501: which the manifold of an empirical intuition is given, in order to fix
4502: my attention exclusively on the unity which is brought by the
4503: understanding into the intuition by means of the category. In what
4504: follows (§ 22), it will be shown, from the mode in which the empirical
4505: intuition is given in the faculty of sensibility, that the unity which
4506: belongs to it is no other than that which the category (according to §
4507: 16) imposes on the manifold in a given intuition, and thus, its à
4508: priori validity in regard to all objects of sense being established,
4509: the purpose of our deduction will be fully attained.
4510: 
4511:  [19] The proof of this rests on the represented unity of intuition, by
4512:  means of which an object is given, and which always includes in itself
4513:  a synthesis of the manifold to be intuited, and also the relation of
4514:  this latter to unity of apperception.
4515: 
4516: 
4517: But there is one thing in the above demonstration of which I could not
4518: make abstraction, namely, that the manifold to be intuited must be
4519: given previously to the synthesis of the understanding, and
4520: independently of it. How this takes place remains here undetermined.
4521: For if I cogitate an understanding which was itself intuitive (as, for
4522: example, a divine understanding which should not represent given
4523: objects, but by whose representation the objects themselves should be
4524: given or produced), the categories would possess no significance in
4525: relation to such a faculty of cognition. They are merely rules for an
4526: understanding, whose whole power consists in thought, that is, in the
4527: act of submitting the synthesis of the manifold which is presented to
4528: it in intuition from a very different quarter, to the unity of
4529: apperception; a faculty, therefore, which cognizes nothing per se, but
4530: only connects and arranges the material of cognition, the intuition,
4531: namely, which must be presented to it by means of the object. But to
4532: show reasons for this peculiar character of our understandings, that it
4533: produces unity of apperception à priori only by means of categories,
4534: and a certain kind and number thereof, is as impossible as to explain
4535: why we are endowed with precisely so many functions of judgement and no
4536: more, or why time and space are the only forms of our intuition.
4537: 
4538: In Cognition, its Application to Objects of Experience is the only
4539: legitimate use of the Category § 18
4540: 
4541: To think an object and to cognize an object are by no means the same
4542: thing. In cognition there are two elements: firstly, the conception,
4543: whereby an object is cogitated (the category); and, secondly, the
4544: intuition, whereby the object is given. For supposing that to the
4545: conception a corresponding intuition could not be given, it would still
4546: be a thought as regards its form, but without any object, and no
4547: cognition of anything would be possible by means of it, inasmuch as, so
4548: far as I knew, there existed and could exist nothing to which my
4549: thought could be applied. Now all intuition possible to us is sensuous;
4550: consequently, our thought of an object by means of a pure conception of
4551: the understanding, can become cognition for us only in so far as this
4552: conception is applied to objects of the senses. Sensuous intuition is
4553: either pure intuition (space and time) or empirical intuition—of that
4554: which is immediately represented in space and time by means of
4555: sensation as real. Through the determination of pure intuition we
4556: obtain à priori cognitions of objects, as in mathematics, but only as
4557: regards their form as phenomena; whether there can exist things which
4558: must be intuited in this form is not thereby established. All
4559: mathematical conceptions, therefore, are not per se cognition, except
4560: in so far as we presuppose that there exist things which can only be
4561: represented conformably to the form of our pure sensuous intuition. But
4562: things in space and time are given only in so far as they are
4563: perceptions (representations accompanied with sensation), therefore
4564: only by empirical representation. Consequently the pure conceptions of
4565: the understanding, even when they are applied to intuitions à priori
4566: (as in mathematics), produce cognition only in so far as these (and
4567: therefore the conceptions of the understanding by means of them) can be
4568: applied to empirical intuitions. Consequently the categories do not,
4569: even by means of pure intuition afford us any cognition of things; they
4570: can only do so in so far as they can be applied to empirical intuition.
4571: That is to say, the categories serve only to render empirical cognition
4572: possible. But this is what we call experience. Consequently, in
4573: cognition, their application to objects of experience is the only
4574: legitimate use of the categories.
4575: 
4576: § 19
4577: 
4578: 
4579: The foregoing proposition is of the utmost importance, for it
4580: determines the limits of the exercise of the pure conceptions of the
4581: understanding in regard to objects, just as transcendental æsthetic
4582: determined the limits of the exercise of the pure form of our sensuous
4583: intuition. Space and time, as conditions of the possibility of the
4584: presentation of objects to us, are valid no further than for objects of
4585: sense, consequently, only for experience. Beyond these limits they
4586: represent to us nothing, for they belong only to sense, and have no
4587: reality apart from it. The pure conceptions of the understanding are
4588: free from this limitation, and extend to objects of intuition in
4589: general, be the intuition like or unlike to ours, provided only it be
4590: sensuous, and not intellectual. But this extension of conceptions
4591: beyond the range of our intuition is of no advantage; for they are then
4592: mere empty conceptions of objects, as to the possibility or
4593: impossibility of the existence of which they furnish us with no means
4594: of discovery. They are mere forms of thought, without objective
4595: reality, because we have no intuition to which the synthetical unity of
4596: apperception, which alone the categories contain, could be applied, for
4597: the purpose of determining an object. Our sensuous and empirical
4598: intuition can alone give them significance and meaning.
4599: 
4600: If, then, we suppose an object of a non-sensuous intuition to be given
4601: we can in that case represent it by all those predicates which are
4602: implied in the presupposition that nothing appertaining to sensuous
4603: intuition belongs to it; for example, that it is not extended, or in
4604: space; that its duration is not time; that in it no change (the effect
4605: of the determinations in time) is to be met with, and so on. But it is
4606: no proper knowledge if I merely indicate what the intuition of the
4607: object is not, without being able to say what is contained in it, for I
4608: have not shown the possibility of an object to which my pure conception
4609: of understanding could be applicable, because I have not been able to
4610: furnish any intuition corresponding to it, but am only able to say that
4611: our intuition is not valid for it. But the most important point is
4612: this, that to a something of this kind not one category can be found
4613: applicable. Take, for example, the conception of substance, that is,
4614: something that can exist as subject, but never as mere predicate; in
4615: regard to this conception I am quite ignorant whether there can really
4616: be anything to correspond to such a determination of thought, if
4617: empirical intuition did not afford me the occasion for its application.
4618: But of this more in the sequel.
4619: 
4620: Of the Application of the Categories to Objects of the Senses in
4621: general § 20
4622: 
4623: The pure conceptions of the understanding apply to objects of intuition
4624: in general, through the understanding alone, whether the intuition be
4625: our own or some other, provided only it be sensuous, but are, for this
4626: very reason, mere forms of thought, by means of which alone no
4627: determined object can be cognized. The synthesis or conjunction of the
4628: manifold in these conceptions relates, we have said, only to the unity
4629: of apperception, and is for this reason the ground of the possibility
4630: of à priori cognition, in so far as this cognition is dependent on the
4631: understanding. This synthesis is, therefore, not merely transcendental,
4632: but also purely intellectual. But because a certain form of sensuous
4633: intuition exists in the mind à priori which rests on the receptivity of
4634: the representative faculty (sensibility), the understanding, as a
4635: spontaneity, is able to determine the internal sense by means of the
4636: diversity of given representations, conformably to the synthetical
4637: unity of apperception, and thus to cogitate the synthetical unity of
4638: the apperception of the manifold of sensuous intuition à priori, as the
4639: condition to which must necessarily be submitted all objects of human
4640: intuition. And in this manner the categories as mere forms of thought
4641: receive objective reality, that is, application to objects which are
4642: given to us in intuition, but that only as phenomena, for it is only of
4643: phenomena that we are capable of à priori intuition.
4644: 
4645: This synthesis of the manifold of sensuous intuition, which is possible
4646: and necessary à priori, may be called figurative (synthesis speciosa),
4647: in contradistinction to that which is cogitated in the mere category in
4648: regard to the manifold of an intuition in general, and is called
4649: connection or conjunction of the understanding (synthesis
4650: intellectualis). Both are transcendental, not merely because they
4651: themselves precede à priori all experience, but also because they form
4652: the basis for the possibility of other cognition à priori.
4653: 
4654: But the figurative synthesis, when it has relation only to the
4655: originally synthetical unity of apperception, that is to the
4656: transcendental unity cogitated in the categories, must, to be
4657: distinguished from the purely intellectual conjunction, be entitled the
4658: transcendental synthesis of imagination. Imagination is the faculty of
4659: representing an object even without its presence in intuition. Now, as
4660: all our intuition is sensuous, imagination, by reason of the subjective
4661: condition under which alone it can give a corresponding intuition to
4662: the conceptions of the understanding, belongs to sensibility. But in so
4663: far as the synthesis of the imagination is an act of spontaneity, which
4664: is determinative, and not, like sense, merely determinable, and which
4665: is consequently able to determine sense à priori, according to its
4666: form, conformably to the unity of apperception, in so far is the
4667: imagination a faculty of determining sensibility à priori, and its
4668: synthesis of intuitions according to the categories must be the
4669: transcendental synthesis of the imagination. It is an operation of the
4670: understanding on sensibility, and the first application of the
4671: understanding to objects of possible intuition, and at the same time
4672: the basis for the exercise of the other functions of that faculty. As
4673: figurative, it is distinguished from the merely intellectual synthesis,
4674: which is produced by the understanding alone, without the aid of
4675: imagination. Now, in so far as imagination is spontaneity, I sometimes
4676: call it also the productive imagination, and distinguish it from the
4677: reproductive, the synthesis of which is subject entirely to empirical
4678: laws, those of association, namely, and which, therefore, contributes
4679: nothing to the explanation of the possibility of à priori cognition,
4680: and for this reason belongs not to transcendental philosophy, but to
4681: psychology.
4682: 
4683: We have now arrived at the proper place for explaining the paradox
4684: which must have struck every one in our exposition of the internal
4685: sense (§ 6), namely—how this sense represents us to our own
4686: consciousness, only as we appear to ourselves, not as we are in
4687: ourselves, because, to wit, we intuite ourselves only as we are
4688: inwardly affected. Now this appears to be contradictory, inasmuch as we
4689: thus stand in a passive relation to ourselves; and therefore in the
4690: systems of psychology, the internal sense is commonly held to be one
4691: with the faculty of apperception, while we, on the contrary, carefully
4692: distinguish them.
4693: 
4694: That which determines the internal sense is the understanding, and its
4695: original power of conjoining the manifold of intuition, that is, of
4696: bringing this under an apperception (upon which rests the possibility
4697: of the understanding itself). Now, as the human understanding is not in
4698: itself a faculty of intuition, and is unable to exercise such a power,
4699: in order to conjoin, as it were, the manifold of its own intuition, the
4700: synthesis of understanding is, considered per se, nothing but the unity
4701: of action, of which, as such, it is self-conscious, even apart from
4702: sensibility, by which, moreover, it is able to determine our internal
4703: sense in respect of the manifold which may be presented to it according
4704: to the form of sensuous intuition. Thus, under the name of a
4705: transcendental synthesis of imagination, the understanding exercises an
4706: activity upon the passive subject, whose faculty it is; and so we are
4707: right in saying that the internal sense is affected thereby.
4708: Apperception and its synthetical unity are by no means one and the same
4709: with the internal sense. The former, as the source of all our
4710: synthetical conjunction, applies, under the name of the categories, to
4711: the manifold of intuition in general, prior to all sensuous intuition
4712: of objects. The internal sense, on the contrary, contains merely the
4713: form of intuition, but without any synthetical conjunction of the
4714: manifold therein, and consequently does not contain any determined
4715: intuition, which is possible only through consciousness of the
4716: determination of the manifold by the transcendental act of the
4717: imagination (synthetical influence of the understanding on the internal
4718: sense), which I have named figurative synthesis.
4719: 
4720: This we can indeed always perceive in ourselves. We cannot cogitate a
4721: geometrical line without drawing it in thought, nor a circle without
4722: describing it, nor represent the three dimensions of space without
4723: drawing three lines from the same point perpendicular to one another.
4724: We cannot even cogitate time, unless, in drawing a straight line (which
4725: is to serve as the external figurative representation of time), we fix
4726: our attention on the act of the synthesis of the manifold, whereby we
4727: determine successively the internal sense, and thus attend also to the
4728: succession of this determination. Motion as an act of the subject (not
4729: as a determination of an object),[20] consequently the synthesis of the
4730: manifold in space, if we make abstraction of space and attend merely to
4731: the act by which we determine the internal sense according to its form,
4732: is that which produces the conception of succession. The understanding,
4733: therefore, does by no means find in the internal sense any such
4734: synthesis of the manifold, but produces it, in that it affects this
4735: sense. At the same time, how “I who think” is distinct from the “i”
4736: which intuites itself (other modes of intuition being cogitable as at
4737: least possible), and yet one and the same with this latter as the same
4738: subject; how, therefore, I am able to say: “I, as an intelligence and
4739: thinking subject, cognize myself as an object thought, so far as I am,
4740: moreover, given to myself in intuition—only, like other phenomena, not
4741: as I am in myself, and as considered by the understanding, but merely
4742: as I appear”—is a question that has in it neither more nor less
4743: difficulty than the question—“How can I be an object to myself?” or
4744: this—“How I can be an object of my own intuition and internal
4745: perceptions?” But that such must be the fact, if we admit that space is
4746: merely a pure form of the phenomena of external sense, can be clearly
4747: proved by the consideration that we cannot represent time, which is not
4748: an object of external intuition, in any other way than under the image
4749: of a line, which we draw in thought, a mode of representation without
4750: which we could not cognize the unity of its dimension, and also that we
4751: are necessitated to take our determination of periods of time, or of
4752: points of time, for all our internal perceptions from the changes which
4753: we perceive in outward things. It follows that we must arrange the
4754: determinations of the internal sense, as phenomena in time, exactly in
4755: the same manner as we arrange those of the external senses in space.
4756: And consequently, if we grant, respecting this latter, that by means of
4757: them we know objects only in so far as we are affected externally, we
4758: must also confess, with regard to the internal sense, that by means of
4759: it we intuite ourselves only as we are internally affected by
4760: ourselves; in other words, as regards internal intuition, we cognize
4761: our own subject only as phenomenon, and not as it is in itself.[21]
4762: 
4763:  [20] Motion of an object in space does not belong to a pure science,
4764:  consequently not to geometry; because, that a thing is movable cannot
4765:  be known à priori, but only from experience. But motion, considered as
4766:  the description of a space, is a pure act of the successive synthesis
4767:  of the manifold in external intuition by means of productive
4768:  imagination, and belongs not only to geometry, but even to
4769:  transcendental philosophy.
4770: 
4771: 
4772:  [21] I do not see why so much difficulty should be found in admitting
4773:  that our internal sense is affected by ourselves. Every act of
4774:  attention exemplifies it. In such an act the understanding determines
4775:  the internal sense by the synthetical conjunction which it cogitates,
4776:  conformably to the internal intuition which corresponds to the
4777:  manifold in the synthesis of the understanding. How much the mind is
4778:  usually affected thereby every one will be able to perceive in
4779:  himself.

4785: On the other hand, in the transcendental synthesis of the manifold
4786: content of representations, consequently in the synthetical unity of
4787: apperception, I am conscious of myself, not as I appear to myself, nor
4788: as I am in myself, but only that “I am.” This representation is a
4789: thought, not an intuition. Now, as in order to cognize ourselves, in
4790: addition to the act of thinking, which subjects the manifold of every
4791: possible intuition to the unity of apperception, there is necessary a
4792: determinate mode of intuition, whereby this manifold is given; although
4793: my own existence is certainly not mere phenomenon (much less mere
4794: illusion), the determination of my existence[22] Can only take place
4795: conformably to the form of the internal sense, according to the
4796: particular mode in which the manifold which I conjoin is given in
4797: internal intuition, and I have therefore no knowledge of myself as I
4798: am, but merely as I appear to myself. The consciousness of self is thus
4799: very far from a knowledge of self, in which I do not use the
4800: categories, whereby I cogitate an object, by means of the conjunction
4801: of the manifold in one apperception. In the same way as I require, for
4802: the sake of the cognition of an object distinct from myself, not only
4803: the thought of an object in general (in the category), but also an
4804: intuition by which to determine that general conception, in the same
4805: way do I require, in order to the cognition of myself, not only the
4806: consciousness of myself or the thought that I think myself, but in
4807: addition an intuition of the manifold in myself, by which to determine
4808: this thought. It is true that I exist as an intelligence which is
4809: conscious only of its faculty of conjunction or synthesis, but
4810: subjected in relation to the manifold which this intelligence has to
4811: conjoin to a limitative conjunction called the internal sense. My
4812: intelligence (that is, I) can render that conjunction or synthesis
4813: perceptible only according to the relations of time, which are quite
4814: beyond the proper sphere of the conceptions of the understanding and
4815: consequently cognize itself in respect to an intuition (which cannot
4816: possibly be intellectual, nor given by the understanding), only as it
4817: appears to itself, and not as it would cognize itself, if its intuition
4818: were intellectual.
4819: 
4820:  [22] The “I think” expresses the act of determining my own existence.
4821:  My existence is thus already given by the act of consciousness; but
4822:  the mode in which I must determine my existence, that is, the mode in
4823:  which I must place the manifold belonging to my existence, is not
4824:  thereby given. For this purpose intuition of self is required, and
4825:  this intuition possesses a form given à priori, namely, time, which is
4826:  sensuous, and belongs to our receptivity of the determinable. Now, as
4827:  I do not possess another intuition of self which gives the determining
4828:  in me (of the spontaneity of which I am conscious), prior to the act
4829:  of determination, in the same manner as time gives the determinable,
4830:  it is clear that I am unable to determine my own existence as that of
4831:  a spontaneous being, but I am only able to represent to myself the
4832:  spontaneity of my thought, that is, of my determination, and my
4833:  existence remains ever determinable in a purely sensuous manner, that
4834:  is to say, like the existence of a phenomenon. But it is because of
4835:  this spontaneity that I call myself an intelligence.
4836: 
4837: Transcendental Deduction of the universally possible employment in
4838: experience of the Pure Conceptions of the Understanding § 22
4839: 
4840: In the metaphysical deduction, the à priori origin of categories was
4841: proved by their complete accordance with the general logical of
4842: thought; in the transcendental deduction was exhibited the possibility
4843: of the categories as à priori cognitions of objects of an intuition in
4844: general (§ 16 and 17).At present we are about to explain the
4845: possibility of cognizing, à priori, by means of the categories, all
4846: objects which can possibly be presented to our senses, not, indeed,
4847: according to the form of their intuition, but according to the laws of
4848: their conjunction or synthesis, and thus, as it were, of prescribing
4849: laws to nature and even of rendering nature possible. For if the
4850: categories were inadequate to this task, it would not be evident to us
4851: why everything that is presented to our senses must be subject to those
4852: laws which have an à priori origin in the understanding itself.
4853: 
4854: I premise that by the term synthesis of apprehension I understand the
4855: combination of the manifold in an empirical intuition, whereby
4856: perception, that is, empirical consciousness of the intuition (as
4857: phenomenon), is possible.
4858: 
4859: We have à priori forms of the external and internal sensuous intuition
4860: in the representations of space and time, and to these must the
4861: synthesis of apprehension of the manifold in a phenomenon be always
4862: comformable, because the synthesis itself can only take place according
4863: to these forms. But space and time are not merely forms of sensuous
4864: intuition, but intuitions themselves (which contain a manifold), and
4865: therefore contain à priori the determination of the unity of this
4866: manifold.[23] (See the Transcendent Æsthetic.) Therefore is unity of
4867: the synthesis of the manifold without or within us, consequently also a
4868: conjunction to which all that is to be represented as determined in
4869: space or time must correspond, given à priori along with (not in) these
4870: intuitions, as the condition of the synthesis of all apprehension of
4871: them. But this synthetical unity can be no other than that of the
4872: conjunction of the manifold of a given intuition in general, in a
4873: primitive act of consciousness, according to the categories, but
4874: applied to our sensuous intuition. Consequently all synthesis, whereby
4875: alone is even perception possible, is subject to the categories. And,
4876: as experience is cognition by means of conjoined perceptions, the
4877: categories are conditions of the possibility of experience and are
4878: therefore valid à priori for all objects of experience.
4879: 
4880:  [23] Space represented as an object (as geometry really requires it to
4881:  be) contains more than the mere form of the intuition; namely, a
4882:  combination of the manifold given according to the form of sensibility
4883:  into a representation that can be intuited; so that the form of the
4884:  intuition gives us merely the manifold, but the formal intuition gives
4885:  unity of representation. In the æsthetic, I regarded this unity as
4886:  belonging entirely to sensibility, for the purpose of indicating that
4887:  it antecedes all conceptions, although it presupposes a synthesis
4888:  which does not belong to sense, through which alone, however, all our
4889:  conceptions of space and time are possible. For as by means of this
4890:  unity alone (the understanding determining the sensibility) space and
4891:  time are given as intuitions, it follows that the unity of this
4892:  intuition à priori belongs to space and time, and not to the
4893:  conception of the understanding (§ 20).
4894: 
4895: 
4896: When, then, for example, I make the empirical intuition of a house by
4897: apprehension of the manifold contained therein into a perception, the
4898: necessary unity of space and of my external sensuous intuition lies at
4899: the foundation of this act, and I, as it were, draw the form of the
4900: house conformably to this synthetical unity of the manifold in space.
4901: But this very synthetical unity remains, even when I abstract the form
4902: of space, and has its seat in the understanding, and is in fact the
4903: category of the synthesis of the homogeneous in an intuition; that is
4904: to say, the category of quantity, to which the aforesaid synthesis of
4905: apprehension, that is, the perception, must be completely
4906: conformable.[24]
4907: 
4908:  [24] In this manner it is proved, that the synthesis of apprehension,
4909:  which is empirical, must necessarily be conformable to the synthesis
4910:  of apperception, which is intellectual, and contained à priori in the
4911:  category. It is one and the same spontaneity which at one time, under
4912:  the name of imagination, at another under that of understanding,
4913:  produces conjunction in the manifold of intuition.
4914: 
4915: 
4916: To take another example, when I perceive the freezing of water, I
4917: apprehend two states (fluidity and solidity), which, as such, stand
4918: toward each other mutually in a relation of time. But in the time,
4919: which I place as an internal intuition, at the foundation of this
4920: phenomenon, I represent to myself synthetical unity of the manifold,
4921: without which the aforesaid relation could not be given in an intuition
4922: as determined (in regard to the succession of time). Now this
4923: synthetical unity, as the à priori condition under which I conjoin the
4924: manifold of an intuition, is, if I make abstraction of the permanent
4925: form of my internal intuition (that is to say, of time), the category
4926: of cause, by means of which, when applied to my sensibility, I
4927: determine everything that occurs according to relations of time.
4928: Consequently apprehension in such an event, and the event itself, as
4929: far as regards the possibility of its perception, stands under the
4930: conception of the relation of cause and effect: and so in all other
4931: cases.
4932: 
4933: Categories are conceptions which prescribe laws à priori to phenomena,
4934: consequently to nature as the complex of all phenomena (natura
4935: materialiter spectata). And now the question arises—inasmuch as these
4936: categories are not derived from nature, and do not regulate themselves
4937: according to her as their model (for in that case they would be
4938: empirical)—how it is conceivable that nature must regulate herself
4939: according to them, in other words, how the categories can determine à
4940: priori the synthesis of the manifold of nature, and yet not derive
4941: their origin from her. The following is the solution of this enigma.
4942: 
4943: It is not in the least more difficult to conceive how the laws of the
4944: phenomena of nature must harmonize with the understanding and with its
4945: à priori form—that is, its faculty of conjoining the manifold—than it
4946: is to understand how the phenomena themselves must correspond with the
4947: à priori form of our sensuous intuition. For laws do not exist in the
4948: phenomena any more than the phenomena exist as things in themselves.
4949: Laws do not exist except by relation to the subject in which the
4950: phenomena inhere, in so far as it possesses understanding, just as
4951: phenomena have no existence except by relation to the same existing
4952: subject in so far as it has senses. To things as things in themselves,
4953: conformability to law must necessarily belong independently of an
4954: understanding to cognize them. But phenomena are only representations
4955: of things which are utterly unknown in respect to what they are in
4956: themselves. But as mere representations, they stand under no law of
4957: conjunction except that which the conjoining faculty prescribes. Now
4958: that which conjoins the manifold of sensuous intuition is imagination,
4959: a mental act to which understanding contributes unity of intellectual
4960: synthesis, and sensibility, manifoldness of apprehension. Now as all
4961: possible perception depends on the synthesis of apprehension, and this
4962: empirical synthesis itself on the transcendental, consequently on the
4963: categories, it is evident that all possible perceptions, and therefore
4964: everything that can attain to empirical consciousness, that is, all
4965: phenomena of nature, must, as regards their conjunction, be subject to
4966: the categories. And nature (considered merely as nature in general) is
4967: dependent on them, as the original ground of her necessary
4968: conformability to law (as natura formaliter spectata). But the pure
4969: faculty (of the understanding) of prescribing laws à priori to
4970: phenomena by means of mere categories, is not competent to enounce
4971: other or more laws than those on which a nature in general, as a
4972: conformability to law of phenomena of space and time, depends.
4973: Particular laws, inasmuch as they concern empirically determined
4974: phenomena, cannot be entirely deduced from pure laws, although they all
4975: stand under them. Experience must be superadded in order to know these
4976: particular laws; but in regard to experience in general, and everything
4977: that can be cognized as an object thereof, these à priori laws are our
4978: only rule and guide.
4979: 
4980: Result of this Deduction of the Conceptions of the Understanding § 23
4981: 
4982: We cannot think any object except by means of the categories; we cannot
4983: cognize any thought except by means of intuitions corresponding to
4984: these conceptions. Now all our intuitions are sensuous, and our
4985: cognition, in so far as the object of it is given, is empirical. But
4986: empirical cognition is experience; consequently no à priori cognition
4987: is possible for us, except of objects of possible experience.[25]
4988: 
4989:  [25] Lest my readers should stumble at this assertion, and the
4990:  conclusions that may be too rashly drawn from it, I must remind them
4991:  that the categories in the act of thought are by no means limited by
4992:  the conditions of our sensuous intuition, but have an unbounded sphere
4993:  of action. It is only the cognition of the object of thought, the
4994:  determining of the object, which requires intuition. In the absence of
4995:  intuition, our thought of an object may still have true and useful
4996:  consequences in regard to the exercise of reason by the subject. But
4997:  as this exercise of reason is not always directed on the determination
4998:  of the object, in other words, on cognition thereof, but also on the
4999:  determination of the subject and its volition, I do not intend to
5000:  treat of it in this place.
5001: 
5002: 
5003: But this cognition, which is limited to objects of experience, is not
5004: for that reason derived entirely, from, experience, but—and this is
5005: asserted of the pure intuitions and the pure conceptions of the
5006: understanding—there are, unquestionably, elements of cognition, which
5007: exist in the mind à priori. Now there are only two ways in which a
5008: necessary harmony of experience with the conceptions of its objects can
5009: be cogitated. Either experience makes these conceptions possible, or
5010: the conceptions make experience possible. The former of these
5011: statements will not hold good with respect to the categories (nor in
5012: regard to pure sensuous intuition), for they are à priori conceptions,
5013: and therefore independent of experience. The assertion of an empirical
5014: origin would attribute to them a sort of generatio aequivoca.
5015: Consequently, nothing remains but to adopt the second alternative
5016: (which presents us with a system, as it were, of the epigenesis of pure
5017: reason), namely, that on the part of the understanding the categories
5018: do contain the grounds of the possibility of all experience. But with
5019: respect to the questions how they make experience possible, and what
5020: are the principles of the possibility thereof with which they present
5021: us in their application to phenomena, the following section on the
5022: transcendental exercise of the faculty of judgement will inform the
5023: reader.
5024: 
5025: It is quite possible that someone may propose a species of
5026: preformation-system of pure reason—a middle way between the two—to wit,
5027: that the categories are neither innate and first à priori principles of
5028: cognition, nor derived from experience, but are merely subjective
5029: aptitudes for thought implanted in us contemporaneously with our
5030: existence, which were so ordered and disposed by our Creator, that
5031: their exercise perfectly harmonizes with the laws of nature which
5032: regulate experience. Now, not to mention that with such an hypothesis
5033: it is impossible to say at what point we must stop in the employment of
5034: predetermined aptitudes, the fact that the categories would in this
5035: case entirely lose that character of necessity which is essentially
5036: involved in the very conception of them, is a conclusive objection to
5037: it. The conception of cause, for example, which expresses the necessity
5038: of an effect under a presupposed condition, would be false, if it
5039: rested only upon such an arbitrary subjective necessity of uniting
5040: certain empirical representations according to such a rule of relation.
5041: I could not then say—“The effect is connected with its cause in the
5042: object (that is, necessarily),” but only, “I am so constituted that I
5043: can think this representation as so connected, and not otherwise.” Now
5044: this is just what the sceptic wants. For in this case, all our
5045: knowledge, depending on the supposed objective validity of our
5046: judgement, is nothing but mere illusion; nor would there be wanting
5047: people who would deny any such subjective necessity in respect to
5048: themselves, though they must feel it. At all events, we could not
5049: dispute with any one on that which merely depends on the manner in
5050: which his subject is organized.
5051: 
5052: Short view of the above Deduction.
5053: 
5054: The foregoing deduction is an exposition of the pure conceptions of the
5055: understanding (and with them of all theoretical à priori cognition), as
5056: principles of the possibility of experience, but of experience as the
5057: determination of all phenomena in space and time in general—of
5058: experience, finally, from the principle of the original synthetical
5059: unity of apperception, as the form of the understanding in relation to
5060: time and space as original forms of sensibility.
5061: 
5062: I consider the division by paragraphs to be necessary only up to this
5063: point, because we had to treat of the elementary conceptions. As we now
5064: proceed to the exposition of the employment of these, I shall not
5065: designate the chapters in this manner any further.
5066: 
5067: BOOK II. Analytic of Principles
5068: 
5069: General logic is constructed upon a plan which coincides exactly with
5070: the division of the higher faculties of cognition. These are,
5071: understanding, judgement, and reason. This science, accordingly, treats
5072: in its analytic of conceptions, judgements, and conclusions in exact
5073: correspondence with the functions and order of those mental powers
5074: which we include generally under the generic denomination of
5075: understanding.
5076: 
5077: As this merely formal logic makes abstraction of all content of
5078: cognition, whether pure or empirical, and occupies itself with the mere
5079: form of thought (discursive cognition), it must contain in its analytic
5080: a canon for reason. For the form of reason has its law, which, without
5081: taking into consideration the particular nature of the cognition about
5082: which it is employed, can be discovered à priori, by the simple
5083: analysis of the action of reason into its momenta.
5084: 
5085: Transcendental logic, limited as it is to a determinate content, that
5086: of pure à priori cognitions, to wit, cannot imitate general logic in
5087: this division. For it is evident that the transcendental employment of
5088: reason is not objectively valid, and therefore does not belong to the
5089: logic of truth (that is, to analytic), but as a logic of illusion,
5090: occupies a particular department in the scholastic system under the
5091: name of transcendental dialectic.
5092: 
5093: Understanding and judgement accordingly possess in transcendental logic
5094: a canon of objectively valid, and therefore true exercise, and are
5095: comprehended in the analytical department of that logic. But reason, in
5096: her endeavours to arrive by à priori means at some true statement
5097: concerning objects and to extend cognition beyond the bounds of
5098: possible experience, is altogether dialectic, and her illusory
5099: assertions cannot be constructed into a canon such as an analytic ought
5100: to contain.
5101: 
5102: Accordingly, the analytic of principles will be merely a canon for the
5103: faculty of judgement, for the instruction of this faculty in its
5104: application to phenomena of the pure conceptions of the understanding,
5105: which contain the necessary condition for the establishment of à priori
5106: laws. On this account, although the subject of the following chapters
5107: is the especial principles of understanding, I shall make use of the
5108: term Doctrine of the faculty of judgement, in order to define more
5109: particularly my present purpose.
5110: 
5111: INTRODUCTION. Of the Transcendental Faculty of judgement in General
5112: 
5113: If understanding in general be defined as the faculty of laws or rules,
5114: the faculty of judgement may be termed the faculty of subsumption under
5115: these rules; that is, of distinguishing whether this or that does or
5116: does not stand under a given rule (casus datae legis). General logic
5117: contains no directions or precepts for the faculty of judgement, nor
5118: can it contain any such. For as it makes abstraction of all content of
5119: cognition, no duty is left for it, except that of exposing analytically
5120: the mere form of cognition in conceptions, judgements, and conclusions,
5121: and of thereby establishing formal rules for all exercise of the
5122: understanding. Now if this logic wished to give some general direction
5123: how we should subsume under these rules, that is, how we should
5124: distinguish whether this or that did or did not stand under them, this
5125: again could not be done otherwise than by means of a rule. But this
5126: rule, precisely because it is a rule, requires for itself direction
5127: from the faculty of judgement. Thus, it is evident that the
5128: understanding is capable of being instructed by rules, but that the
5129: judgement is a peculiar talent, which does not, and cannot require
5130: tuition, but only exercise. This faculty is therefore the specific
5131: quality of the so-called mother wit, the want of which no scholastic
5132: discipline can compensate.
5133: 
5134: For although education may furnish, and, as it were, engraft upon a
5135: limited understanding rules borrowed from other minds, yet the power of
5136: employing these rules correctly must belong to the pupil himself; and
5137: no rule which we can prescribe to him with this purpose is, in the
5138: absence or deficiency of this gift of nature, secure from misuse.[26] A
5139: physician therefore, a judge or a statesman, may have in his head many
5140: admirable pathological, juridical, or political rules, in a degree that
5141: may enable him to be a profound teacher in his particular science, and
5142: yet in the application of these rules he may very possibly
5143: blunder—either because he is wanting in natural judgement (though not
5144: in understanding) and, whilst he can comprehend the general in
5145: abstracto, cannot distinguish whether a particular case in concreto
5146: ought to rank under the former; or because his faculty of judgement has
5147: not been sufficiently exercised by examples and real practice. Indeed,
5148: the grand and only use of examples, is to sharpen the judgement. For as
5149: regards the correctness and precision of the insight of the
5150: understanding, examples are commonly injurious rather than otherwise,
5151: because, as casus in terminis they seldom adequately fulfil the
5152: conditions of the rule. Besides, they often weaken the power of our
5153: understanding to apprehend rules or laws in their universality,
5154: independently of particular circumstances of experience; and hence,
5155: accustom us to employ them more as formulae than as principles.
5156: Examples are thus the go-cart of the judgement, which he who is
5157: naturally deficient in that faculty cannot afford to dispense with.
5158: 
5159:  [26] Deficiency in judgement is properly that which is called
5160:  stupidity; and for such a failing we know no remedy. A dull or
5161:  narrow-minded person, to whom nothing is wanting but a proper degree
5162:  of understanding, may be improved by tuition, even so far as to
5163:  deserve the epithet of learned. But as such persons frequently labour
5164:  under a deficiency in the faculty of judgement, it is not uncommon to
5165:  find men extremely learned who in the application of their science
5166:  betray a lamentable degree this irremediable want.
5167: 
5168: 
5169: But although general logic cannot give directions to the faculty of
5170: judgement, the case is very different as regards transcendental logic,
5171: insomuch that it appears to be the especial duty of the latter to
5172: secure and direct, by means of determinate rules, the faculty of
5173: judgement in the employment of the pure understanding. For, as a
5174: doctrine, that is, as an endeavour to enlarge the sphere of the
5175: understanding in regard to pure à priori cognitions, philosophy is
5176: worse than useless, since from all the attempts hitherto made, little
5177: or no ground has been gained. But, as a critique, in order to guard
5178: against the mistakes of the faculty of judgement (lapsus judicii) in
5179: the employment of the few pure conceptions of the understanding which
5180: we possess, although its use is in this case purely negative,
5181: philosophy is called upon to apply all its acuteness and penetration.
5182: 
5183: But transcendental philosophy has this peculiarity, that besides
5184: indicating the rule, or rather the general condition for rules, which
5185: is given in the pure conception of the understanding, it can, at the
5186: same time, indicate à priori the case to which the rule must be
5187: applied. The cause of the superiority which, in this respect,
5188: transcendental philosophy possesses above all other sciences except
5189: mathematics, lies in this: it treats of conceptions which must relate à
5190: priori to their objects, whose objective validity consequently cannot
5191: be demonstrated à posteriori, and is, at the same time, under the
5192: obligation of presenting in general but sufficient tests, the
5193: conditions under which objects can be given in harmony with those
5194: conceptions; otherwise they would be mere logical forms, without
5195: content, and not pure conceptions of the understanding.
5196: 
5197: Our transcendental doctrine of the faculty of judgement will contain
5198: two chapters. The first will treat of the sensuous condition under
5199: which alone pure conceptions of the understanding can be employed—that
5200: is, of the schematism of the pure understanding. The second will treat
5201: of those synthetical judgements which are derived à priori from pure
5202: conceptions of the understanding under those conditions, and which lie
5203: à priori at the foundation of all other cognitions, that is to say, it
5204: will treat of the principles of the pure understanding.
5205: 
5206: TRANSCENDENTAL DOCTRINE OF THE FACULTY OF JUDGEMENT OR, ANALYTIC OF
5207: PRINCIPLES
5208: 
5209: Chapter I. Of the Schematism at of the Pure Conceptions of the
5210: Understanding
5211: 
5212: In all subsumptions of an object under a conception, the representation
5213: of the object must be homogeneous with the conception; in other words,
5214: the conception must contain that which is represented in the object to
5215: be subsumed under it. For this is the meaning of the expression: “An
5216: object is contained under a conception.” Thus the empirical conception
5217: of a plate is homogeneous with the pure geometrical conception of a
5218: circle, inasmuch as the roundness which is cogitated in the former is
5219: intuited in the latter.
5220: 
5221: But pure conceptions of the understanding, when compared with empirical
5222: intuitions, or even with sensuous intuitions in general, are quite
5223: heterogeneous, and never can be discovered in any intuition. How then
5224: is the subsumption of the latter under the former, and consequently the
5225: application of the categories to phenomena, possible?—For it is
5226: impossible to say, for example: “Causality can be intuited through the
5227: senses and is contained in the phenomenon.”—This natural and important
5228: question forms the real cause of the necessity of a transcendental
5229: doctrine of the faculty of judgement, with the purpose, to wit, of
5230: showing how pure conceptions of the understanding can be applied to
5231: phenomena. In all other sciences, where the conceptions by which the
5232: object is thought in the general are not so different and heterogeneous
5233: from those which represent the object in concreto—as it is given, it is
5234: quite unnecessary to institute any special inquiries concerning the
5235: application of the former to the latter.
5236: 
5237: Now it is quite clear that there must be some third thing, which on the
5238: one side is homogeneous with the category, and with the phenomenon on
5239: the other, and so makes the application of the former to the latter
5240: possible. This mediating representation must be pure (without any
5241: empirical content), and yet must on the one side be intellectual, on
5242: the other sensuous. Such a representation is the transcendental schema.
5243: 
5244: The conception of the understanding contains pure synthetical unity of
5245: the manifold in general. Time, as the formal condition of the manifold
5246: of the internal sense, consequently of the conjunction of all
5247: representations, contains à priori a manifold in the pure intuition.
5248: Now a transcendental determination of time is so far homogeneous with
5249: the category, which constitutes the unity thereof, that it is universal
5250: and rests upon a rule à priori. On the other hand, it is so far
5251: homogeneous with the phenomenon, inasmuch as time is contained in every
5252: empirical representation of the manifold. Thus an application of the
5253: category to phenomena becomes possible, by means of the transcendental
5254: determination of time, which, as the schema of the conceptions of the
5255: understanding, mediates the subsumption of the latter under the former.
5256: 
5257: After what has been proved in our deduction of the categories, no one,
5258: it is to be hoped, can hesitate as to the proper decision of the
5259: question, whether the employment of these pure conceptions of the
5260: understanding ought to be merely empirical or also transcendental; in
5261: other words, whether the categories, as conditions of a possible
5262: experience, relate à priori solely to phenomena, or whether, as
5263: conditions of the possibility of things in general, their application
5264: can be extended to objects as things in themselves. For we have there
5265: seen that conceptions are quite impossible, and utterly without
5266: signification, unless either to them, or at least to the elements of
5267: which they consist, an object be given; and that, consequently, they
5268: cannot possibly apply to objects as things in themselves without regard
5269: to the question whether and how these may be given to us; and, further,
5270: that the only manner in which objects can be given to us is by means of
5271: the modification of our sensibility; and, finally, that pure à priori
5272: conceptions, in addition to the function of the understanding in the
5273: category, must contain à priori formal conditions of sensibility (of
5274: the internal sense, namely), which again contain the general condition
5275: under which alone the category can be applied to any object. This
5276: formal and pure condition of sensibility, to which the conception of
5277: the understanding is restricted in its employment, we shall name the
5278: schema of the conception of the understanding, and the procedure of the
5279: understanding with these schemata we shall call the schematism of the
5280: pure understanding.
5281: 
5282: The schema is, in itself, always a mere product of the imagination.
5283: But, as the synthesis of imagination has for its aim no single
5284: intuition, but merely unity in the determination of sensibility, the
5285: schema is clearly distinguishable from the image. Thus, if I place five
5286: points one after another.... this is an image of the number five. On
5287: the other hand, if I only think a number in general, which may be
5288: either five or a hundred, this thought is rather the representation of
5289: a method of representing in an image a sum (e.g., a thousand) in
5290: conformity with a conception, than the image itself, an image which I
5291: should find some little difficulty in reviewing, and comparing with the
5292: conception. Now this representation of a general procedure of the
5293: imagination to present its image to a conception, I call the schema of
5294: this conception.
5295: 
5296: In truth, it is not images of objects, but schemata, which lie at the
5297: foundation of our pure sensuous conceptions. No image could ever be
5298: adequate to our conception of a triangle in general. For the
5299: generalness of the conception it never could attain to, as this
5300: includes under itself all triangles, whether right-angled,
5301: acute-angled, etc., whilst the image would always be limited to a
5302: single part of this sphere. The schema of the triangle can exist
5303: nowhere else than in thought, and it indicates a rule of the synthesis
5304: of the imagination in regard to pure figures in space. Still less is an
5305: object of experience, or an image of the object, ever to the empirical
5306: conception. On the contrary, the conception always relates immediately
5307: to the schema of the imagination, as a rule for the determination of
5308: our intuition, in conformity with a certain general conception. The
5309: conception of a dog indicates a rule, according to which my imagination
5310: can delineate the figure of a four-footed animal in general, without
5311: being limited to any particular individual form which experience
5312: presents to me, or indeed to any possible image that I can represent to
5313: myself in concreto. This schematism of our understanding in regard to
5314: phenomena and their mere form, is an art, hidden in the depths of the
5315: human soul, whose true modes of action we shall only with difficulty
5316: discover and unveil. Thus much only can we say: “The image is a product
5317: of the empirical faculty of the productive imagination—the schema of
5318: sensuous conceptions (of figures in space, for example) is a product,
5319: and, as it were, a monogram of the pure imagination à priori, whereby
5320: and according to which images first become possible, which, however,
5321: can be connected with the conception only mediately by means of the
5322: schema which they indicate, and are in themselves never fully adequate
5323: to it.” On the other hand, the schema of a pure conception of the
5324: understanding is something that cannot be reduced into any image—it is
5325: nothing else than the pure synthesis expressed by the category,
5326: conformably, to a rule of unity according to conceptions. It is a
5327: transcendental product of the imagination, a product which concerns the
5328: determination of the internal sense, according to conditions of its
5329: form (time) in respect to all representations, in so far as these
5330: representations must be conjoined à priori in one conception,
5331: conformably to the unity of apperception.
5332: 
5333: Without entering upon a dry and tedious analysis of the essential
5334: requisites of transcendental schemata of the pure conceptions of the
5335: understanding, we shall rather proceed at once to give an explanation
5336: of them according to the order of the categories, and in connection
5337: therewith.
5338: 
5339: For the external sense the pure image of all quantities (quantorum) is
5340: space; the pure image of all objects of sense in general, is time. But
5341: the pure schema of quantity (quantitatis) as a conception of the
5342: understanding, is number, a representation which comprehends the
5343: successive addition of one to one (homogeneous quantities). Thus,
5344: number is nothing else than the unity of the synthesis of the manifold
5345: in a homogeneous intuition, by means of my generating time itself in my
5346: apprehension of the intuition.
5347: 
5348: Reality, in the pure conception of the understanding, is that which
5349: corresponds to a sensation in general; that, consequently, the
5350: conception of which indicates a being (in time). Negation is that the
5351: conception of which represents a not-being (in time). The opposition of
5352: these two consists therefore in the difference of one and the same
5353: time, as a time filled or a time empty. Now as time is only the form of
5354: intuition, consequently of objects as phenomena, that which in objects
5355: corresponds to sensation is the transcendental matter of all objects as
5356: things in themselves (Sachheit, reality). Now every sensation has a
5357: degree or quantity by which it can fill time, that is to say, the
5358: internal sense in respect of the representation of an object, more or
5359: less, until it vanishes into nothing (= 0 = negatio). Thus there is a
5360: relation and connection between reality and negation, or rather a
5361: transition from the former to the latter, which makes every reality
5362: representable to us as a quantum; and the schema of a reality as the
5363: quantity of something in so far as it fills time, is exactly this
5364: continuous and uniform generation of the reality in time, as we descend
5365: in time from the sensation which has a certain degree, down to the
5366: vanishing thereof, or gradually ascend from negation to the quantity
5367: thereof.
5368: 
5369: The schema of substance is the permanence of the real in time; that is,
5370: the representation of it as a substratum of the empirical determination
5371: of time; a substratum which therefore remains, whilst all else changes.
5372: (Time passes not, but in it passes the existence of the changeable. To
5373: time, therefore, which is itself unchangeable and permanent,
5374: corresponds that which in the phenomenon is unchangeable in existence,
5375: that is, substance, and it is only by it that the succession and
5376: coexistence of phenomena can be determined in regard to time.)
5377: 
5378: The schema of cause and of the causality of a thing is the real which,
5379: when posited, is always followed by something else. It consists,
5380: therefore, in the succession of the manifold, in so far as that
5381: succession is subjected to a rule.
5382: 
5383: The schema of community (reciprocity of action and reaction), or the
5384: reciprocal causality of substances in respect of their accidents, is
5385: the coexistence of the determinations of the one with those of the
5386: other, according to a general rule.
5387: 
5388: The schema of possibility is the accordance of the synthesis of
5389: different representations with the conditions of time in general (as,
5390: for example, opposites cannot exist together at the same time in the
5391: same thing, but only after each other), and is therefore the
5392: determination of the representation of a thing at any time.
5393: 
5394: The schema of reality is existence in a determined time.
5395: 
5396: The schema of necessity is the existence of an object in all time.
5397: 
5398: It is clear, from all this, that the schema of the category of quantity
5399: contains and represents the generation (synthesis) of time itself, in
5400: the successive apprehension of an object; the schema of quality the
5401: synthesis of sensation with the representation of time, or the filling
5402: up of time; the schema of relation the relation of perceptions to each
5403: other in all time (that is, according to a rule of the determination of
5404: time): and finally, the schema of modality and its categories, time
5405: itself, as the correlative of the determination of an object—whether it
5406: does belong to time, and how. The schemata, therefore, are nothing but
5407: à priori determinations of time according to rules, and these, in
5408: regard to all possible objects, following the arrangement of the
5409: categories, relate to the series in time, the content in time, the
5410: order in time, and finally, to the complex or totality in time.
5411: 
5412: Hence it is apparent that the schematism of the understanding, by means
5413: of the transcendental synthesis of the imagination, amounts to nothing
5414: else than the unity of the manifold of intuition in the internal sense,
5415: and thus indirectly to the unity of apperception, as a function
5416: corresponding to the internal sense (a receptivity). Thus, the schemata
5417: of the pure conceptions of the understanding are the true and only
5418: conditions whereby our understanding receives an application to
5419: objects, and consequently significance. Finally, therefore, the
5420: categories are only capable of empirical use, inasmuch as they serve
5421: merely to subject phenomena to the universal rules of synthesis, by
5422: means of an à priori necessary unity (on account of the necessary union
5423: of all consciousness in one original apperception); and so to render
5424: them susceptible of a complete connection in one experience. But within
5425: this whole of possible experience lie all our cognitions, and in the
5426: universal relation to this experience consists transcendental truth,
5427: which antecedes all empirical truth, and renders the latter possible.
5428: 
5429: It is, however, evident at first sight, that although the schemata of
5430: sensibility are the sole agents in realizing the categories, they do,
5431: nevertheless, also restrict them, that is, they limit the categories by
5432: conditions which lie beyond the sphere of understanding—namely, in
5433: sensibility. Hence the schema is properly only the phenomenon, or the
5434: sensuous conception of an object in harmony with the category. (Numerus
5435: est quantitas phaenomenon—sensatio realitas phaenomenon; constans et
5436: perdurabile rerum substantia phaenomenon—aeternitas, necessitas,
5437: phaenomena, etc.) Now, if we remove a restrictive condition, we thereby
5438: amplify, it appears, the formerly limited conception. In this way, the
5439: categories in their pure signification, free from all conditions of
5440: sensibility, ought to be valid of things as they are, and not, as the
5441: schemata represent them, merely as they appear; and consequently the
5442: categories must have a significance far more extended, and wholly
5443: independent of all schemata. In truth, there does always remain to the
5444: pure conceptions of the understanding, after abstracting every sensuous
5445: condition, a value and significance, which is, however, merely logical.
5446: But in this case, no object is given them, and therefore they have no
5447: meaning sufficient to afford us a conception of an object. The notion
5448: of substance, for example, if we leave out the sensuous determination
5449: of permanence, would mean nothing more than a something which can be
5450: cogitated as subject, without the possibility of becoming a predicate
5451: to anything else. Of this representation I can make nothing, inasmuch
5452: as it does not indicate to me what determinations the thing possesses
5453: which must thus be valid as premier subject. Consequently, the
5454: categories, without schemata are merely functions of the understanding
5455: for the production of conceptions, but do not represent any object.
5456: This significance they derive from sensibility, which at the same time
5457: realizes the understanding and restricts it.
5458: 
5459: Chapter II. System of all Principles of the Pure Understanding
5460: 
5461: In the foregoing chapter we have merely considered the general
5462: conditions under which alone the transcendental faculty of judgement is
5463: justified in using the pure conceptions of the understanding for
5464: synthetical judgements. Our duty at present is to exhibit in systematic
5465: connection those judgements which the understanding really produces à
5466: priori. For this purpose, our table of the categories will certainly
5467: afford us the natural and safe guidance. For it is precisely the
5468: categories whose application to possible experience must constitute all
5469: pure à priori cognition of the understanding; and the relation of which
5470: to sensibility will, on that very account, present us with a complete
5471: and systematic catalogue of all the transcendental principles of the
5472: use of the understanding.
5473: 
5474: Principles à priori are so called, not merely because they contain in
5475: themselves the grounds of other judgements, but also because they
5476: themselves are not grounded in higher and more general cognitions. This
5477: peculiarity, however, does not raise them altogether above the need of
5478: a proof. For although there could be found no higher cognition, and
5479: therefore no objective proof, and although such a principle rather
5480: serves as the foundation for all cognition of the object, this by no
5481: means hinders us from drawing a proof from the subjective sources of
5482: the possibility of the cognition of an object. Such a proof is
5483: necessary, moreover, because without it the principle might be liable
5484: to the imputation of being a mere gratuitous assertion.
5485: 
5486: In the second place, we shall limit our investigations to those
5487: principles which relate to the categories. For as to the principles of
5488: transcendental æsthetic, according to which space and time are the
5489: conditions of the possibility of things as phenomena, as also the
5490: restriction of these principles, namely, that they cannot be applied to
5491: objects as things in themselves—these, of course, do not fall within
5492: the scope of our present inquiry. In like manner, the principles of
5493: mathematical science form no part of this system, because they are all
5494: drawn from intuition, and not from the pure conception of the
5495: understanding. The possibility of these principles, however, will
5496: necessarily be considered here, inasmuch as they are synthetical
5497: judgements à priori, not indeed for the purpose of proving their
5498: accuracy and apodeictic certainty, which is unnecessary, but merely to
5499: render conceivable and deduce the possibility of such evident à priori
5500: cognitions.
5501: 
5502: But we shall have also to speak of the principle of analytical
5503: judgements, in opposition to synthetical judgements, which is the
5504: proper subject of our inquiries, because this very opposition will free
5505: the theory of the latter from all ambiguity, and place it clearly
5506: before our eyes in its true nature.
5507: 
5508: 
5509: SYSTEM OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE PURE UNDERSTANDING
5510: 
5511: Section I. Of the Supreme Principle of all Analytical Judgements
5512: 
5513: Whatever may be the content of our cognition, and in whatever manner
5514: our cognition may be related to its object, the universal, although
5515: only negative conditions of all our judgements is that they do not
5516: contradict themselves; otherwise these judgements are in themselves
5517: (even without respect to the object) nothing. But although there may
5518: exist no contradiction in our judgement, it may nevertheless connect
5519: conceptions in such a manner that they do not correspond to the object,
5520: or without any grounds either à priori or à posteriori for arriving at
5521: such a judgement, and thus, without being self-contradictory, a
5522: judgement may nevertheless be either false or groundless.
5523: 
5524: Now, the proposition: “No subject can have a predicate that contradicts
5525: it,” is called the principle of contradiction, and is a universal but
5526: purely negative criterion of all truth. But it belongs to logic alone,
5527: because it is valid of cognitions, merely as cognitions and without
5528: respect to their content, and declares that the contradiction entirely
5529: nullifies them. We can also, however, make a positive use of this
5530: principle, that is, not merely to banish falsehood and error (in so far
5531: as it rests upon contradiction), but also for the cognition of truth.
5532: For if the judgement is analytical, be it affirmative or negative, its
5533: truth must always be recognizable by means of the principle of
5534: contradiction. For the contrary of that which lies and is cogitated as
5535: conception in the cognition of the object will be always properly
5536: negatived, but the conception itself must always be affirmed of the
5537: object, inasmuch as the contrary thereof would be in contradiction to
5538: the object.
5539: 
5540: We must therefore hold the principle of contradiction to be the
5541: universal and fully sufficient Principle of all analytical cognition.
5542: But as a sufficient criterion of truth, it has no further utility or
5543: authority. For the fact that no cognition can be at variance with this
5544: principle without nullifying itself, constitutes this principle the
5545: sine qua non, but not the determining ground of the truth of our
5546: cognition. As our business at present is properly with the synthetical
5547: part of our knowledge only, we shall always be on our guard not to
5548: transgress this inviolable principle; but at the same time not to
5549: expect from it any direct assistance in the establishment of the truth
5550: of any synthetical proposition.
5551: 
5552: There exists, however, a formula of this celebrated principle—a
5553: principle merely formal and entirely without content—which contains a
5554: synthesis that has been inadvertently and quite unnecessarily mixed up
5555: with it. It is this: “It is impossible for a thing to be and not to be
5556: at the same time.” Not to mention the superfluousness of the addition
5557: of the word impossible to indicate the apodeictic certainty, which
5558: ought to be self-evident from the proposition itself, the proposition
5559: is affected by the condition of time, and as it were says: “A thing =
5560: A, which is something = B, cannot at the same time be non-B.” But both,
5561: B as well as non-B, may quite well exist in succession. For example, a
5562: man who is young cannot at the same time be old; but the same man can
5563: very well be at one time young, and at another not young, that is, old.
5564: Now the principle of contradiction as a merely logical proposition must
5565: not by any means limit its application merely to relations of time, and
5566: consequently a formula like the preceding is quite foreign to its true
5567: purpose. The misunderstanding arises in this way. We first of all
5568: separate a predicate of a thing from the conception of the thing, and
5569: afterwards connect with this predicate its opposite, and hence do not
5570: establish any contradiction with the subject, but only with its
5571: predicate, which has been conjoined with the subject synthetically—a
5572: contradiction, moreover, which obtains only when the first and second
5573: predicate are affirmed in the same time. If I say: “A man who is
5574: ignorant is not learned,” the condition “at the same time” must be
5575: added, for he who is at one time ignorant, may at another be learned.
5576: But if I say: “No ignorant man is a learned man,” the proposition is
5577: analytical, because the characteristic ignorance is now a constituent
5578: part of the conception of the subject; and in this case the negative
5579: proposition is evident immediately from the proposition of
5580: contradiction, without the necessity of adding the condition “the same
5581: time.” This is the reason why I have altered the formula of this
5582: principle—an alteration which shows very clearly the nature of an
5583: analytical proposition.
5584: 
5585: Section II. Of the Supreme Principle of all Synthetical Judgements
5586: 
5587: The explanation of the possibility of synthetical judgements is a task
5588: with which general logic has nothing to do; indeed she needs not even
5589: be acquainted with its name. But in transcendental logic it is the most
5590: important matter to be dealt with—indeed the only one, if the question
5591: is of the possibility of synthetical judgements à priori, the
5592: conditions and extent of their validity. For when this question is
5593: fully decided, it can reach its aim with perfect ease, the
5594: determination, to wit, of the extent and limits of the pure
5595: understanding.
5596: 
5597: In an analytical judgement I do not go beyond the given conception, in
5598: order to arrive at some decision respecting it. If the judgement is
5599: affirmative, I predicate of the conception only that which was already
5600: cogitated in it; if negative, I merely exclude from the conception its
5601: contrary. But in synthetical judgements, I must go beyond the given
5602: conception, in order to cogitate, in relation with it, something quite
5603: different from that which was cogitated in it, a relation which is
5604: consequently never one either of identity or contradiction, and by
5605: means of which the truth or error of the judgement cannot be discerned
5606: merely from the judgement itself.
5607: 
5608: Granted, then, that we must go out beyond a given conception, in order
5609: to compare it synthetically with another, a third thing is necessary,
5610: in which alone the synthesis of two conceptions can originate. Now what
5611: is this tertium quid that is to be the medium of all synthetical
5612: judgements? It is only a complex in which all our representations are
5613: contained, the internal sense to wit, and its form à priori, time.
5614: 
5615: The synthesis of our representations rests upon the imagination; their
5616: synthetical unity (which is requisite to a judgement), upon the unity
5617: of apperception. In this, therefore, is to be sought the possibility of
5618: synthetical judgements, and as all three contain the sources of à
5619: priori representations, the possibility of pure synthetical judgements
5620: also; nay, they are necessary upon these grounds, if we are to possess
5621: a knowledge of objects, which rests solely upon the synthesis of
5622: representations.
5623: 
5624: If a cognition is to have objective reality, that is, to relate to an
5625: object, and possess sense and meaning in respect to it, it is necessary
5626: that the object be given in some way or another. Without this, our
5627: conceptions are empty, and we may indeed have thought by means of them,
5628: but by such thinking we have not, in fact, cognized anything, we have
5629: merely played with representation. To give an object, if this
5630: expression be understood in the sense of “to present” the object, not
5631: mediately but immediately in intuition, means nothing else than to
5632: apply the representation of it to experience, be that experience real
5633: or only possible. Space and time themselves, pure as these conceptions
5634: are from all that is empirical, and certain as it is that they are
5635: represented fully à priori in the mind, would be completely without
5636: objective validity, and without sense and significance, if their
5637: necessary use in the objects of experience were not shown. Nay, the
5638: representation of them is a mere schema, that always relates to the
5639: reproductive imagination, which calls up the objects of experience,
5640: without which they have no meaning. And so it is with all conceptions
5641: without distinction.
5642: 
5643: The possibility of experience is, then, that which gives objective
5644: reality to all our à priori cognitions. Now experience depends upon the
5645: synthetical unity of phenomena, that is, upon a synthesis according to
5646: conceptions of the object of phenomena in general, a synthesis without
5647: which experience never could become knowledge, but would be merely a
5648: rhapsody of perceptions, never fitting together into any connected
5649: text, according to rules of a thoroughly united (possible)
5650: consciousness, and therefore never subjected to the transcendental and
5651: necessary unity of apperception. Experience has therefore for a
5652: foundation, à priori principles of its form, that is to say, general
5653: rules of unity in the synthesis of phenomena, the objective reality of
5654: which rules, as necessary conditions even of the possibility of
5655: experience can which rules, as necessary conditions—even of the
5656: possibility of experience—can always be shown in experience. But apart
5657: from this relation, à priori synthetical propositions are absolutely
5658: impossible, because they have no third term, that is, no pure object,
5659: in which the synthetical unity can exhibit the objective reality of its
5660: conceptions.
5661: 
5662: Although, then, respecting space, or the forms which productive
5663: imagination describes therein, we do cognize much à priori in
5664: synthetical judgements, and are really in no need of experience for
5665: this purpose, such knowledge would nevertheless amount to nothing but a
5666: busy trifling with a mere chimera, were not space to be considered as
5667: the condition of the phenomena which constitute the material of
5668: external experience. Hence those pure synthetical judgements do relate,
5669: though but mediately, to possible experience, or rather to the
5670: possibility of experience, and upon that alone is founded the objective
5671: validity of their synthesis.
5672: 
5673: While then, on the one hand, experience, as empirical synthesis, is the
5674: only possible mode of cognition which gives reality to all other
5675: synthesis; on the other hand, this latter synthesis, as cognition à
5676: priori, possesses truth, that is, accordance with its object, only in
5677: so far as it contains nothing more than what is necessary to the
5678: synthetical unity of experience.
5679: 
5680: Accordingly, the supreme principle of all synthetical judgements is:
5681: “Every object is subject to the necessary conditions of the synthetical
5682: unity of the manifold of intuition in a possible experience.”
5683: 
5684: À priori synthetical judgements are possible when we apply the formal
5685: conditions of the à priori intuition, the synthesis of the imagination,
5686: and the necessary unity of that synthesis in a transcendental
5687: apperception, to a possible cognition of experience, and say: “The
5688: conditions of the possibility of experience in general are at the same
5689: time conditions of the possibility of the objects of experience, and
5690: have, for that reason, objective validity in an à priori synthetical
5691: judgement.”
5692: 
5693: Section III. Systematic Representation of all Synthetical Principles of
5694: the Pure Understanding
5695: 
5696: That principles exist at all is to be ascribed solely to the pure
5697: understanding, which is not only the faculty of rules in regard to that
5698: which happens, but is even the source of principles according to which
5699: everything that can be presented to us as an object is necessarily
5700: subject to rules, because without such rules we never could attain to
5701: cognition of an object. Even the laws of nature, if they are
5702: contemplated as principles of the empirical use of the understanding,
5703: possess also a characteristic of necessity, and we may therefore at
5704: least expect them to be determined upon grounds which are valid à
5705: priori and antecedent to all experience. But all laws of nature,
5706: without distinction, are subject to higher principles of the
5707: understanding, inasmuch as the former are merely applications of the
5708: latter to particular cases of experience. These higher principles alone
5709: therefore give the conception, which contains the necessary condition,
5710: and, as it were, the exponent of a rule; experience, on the other hand,
5711: gives the case which comes under the rule.
5712: 
5713: There is no danger of our mistaking merely empirical principles for
5714: principles of the pure understanding, or conversely; for the character
5715: of necessity, according to conceptions which distinguish the latter,
5716: and the absence of this in every empirical proposition, how extensively
5717: valid soever it may be, is a perfect safeguard against confounding
5718: them. There are, however, pure principles à priori, which nevertheless
5719: I should not ascribe to the pure understanding—for this reason, that
5720: they are not derived from pure conceptions, but (although by the
5721: mediation of the understanding) from pure intuitions. But understanding
5722: is the faculty of conceptions. Such principles mathematical science
5723: possesses, but their application to experience, consequently their
5724: objective validity, nay the possibility of such à priori synthetical
5725: cognitions (the deduction thereof) rests entirely upon the pure
5726: understanding.
5727: 
5728: On this account, I shall not reckon among my principles those of
5729: mathematics; though I shall include those upon the possibility and
5730: objective validity à priori, of principles of the mathematical science,
5731: which, consequently, are to be looked upon as the principle of these,
5732: and which proceed from conceptions to intuition, and not from intuition
5733: to conceptions.
5734: 
5735: In the application of the pure conceptions of the understanding to
5736: possible experience, the employment of their synthesis is either
5737: mathematical or dynamical, for it is directed partly on the intuition
5738: alone, partly on the existence of a phenomenon. But the à priori
5739: conditions of intuition are in relation to a possible experience
5740: absolutely necessary, those of the existence of objects of a possible
5741: empirical intuition are in themselves contingent. Hence the principles
5742: of the mathematical use of the categories will possess a character of
5743: absolute necessity, that is, will be apodeictic; those, on the other
5744: hand, of the dynamical use, the character of an à priori necessity
5745: indeed, but only under the condition of empirical thought in an
5746: experience, therefore only mediately and indirectly. Consequently they
5747: will not possess that immediate evidence which is peculiar to the
5748: former, although their application to experience does not, for that
5749: reason, lose its truth and certitude. But of this point we shall be
5750: better able to judge at the conclusion of this system of principles.
5751: 
5752: The table of the categories is naturally our guide to the table of
5753: principles, because these are nothing else than rules for the objective
5754: employment of the former. Accordingly, all principles of the pure
5755: understanding are:
5756: 
5757:                                 1
5758:                               Axioms
5759:                            of Intuition
5760: 
5761:                2                                    3
5762:           Anticipations                          Analogies
5763:           of Perception                        of Experience
5764:                                 4
5765:                           Postulates of
5766:                         Empirical Thought
5767:                            in general
5768: 
5769: These appellations I have chosen advisedly, in order that we might not
5770: lose sight of the distinctions in respect of the evidence and the
5771: employment of these principles. It will, however, soon appear that—a
5772: fact which concerns both the evidence of these principles, and the à
5773: priori determination of phenomena—according to the categories of
5774: quantity and quality (if we attend merely to the form of these), the
5775: principles of these categories are distinguishable from those of the
5776: two others, in as much as the former are possessed of an intuitive, but
5777: the latter of a merely discursive, though in both instances a complete,
5778: certitude. I shall therefore call the former mathematical, and the
5779: latter dynamical principles.[27] It must be observed, however, that by
5780: these terms I mean just as little in the one case the principles of
5781: mathematics as those of general (physical) dynamics in the other. I
5782: have here in view merely the principles of the pure understanding, in
5783: their application to the internal sense (without distinction of the
5784: representations given therein), by means of which the sciences of
5785: mathematics and dynamics become possible. Accordingly, I have named
5786: these principles rather with reference to their application than their
5787: content; and I shall now proceed to consider them in the order in which
5788: they stand in the table.
5789: 
5790:  [27] All combination (conjunctio) is either composition (compositio)
5791:  or connection (nexus). The former is the synthesis of a manifold, the
5792:  parts of which do not necessarily belong to each other. For example,
5793:  the two triangles into which a square is divided by a diagonal, do not
5794:  necessarily belong to each other, and of this kind is the synthesis of
5795:  the homogeneous in everything that can be mathematically considered.
5796:  This synthesis can be divided into those of aggregation and coalition,
5797:  the former of which is applied to extensive, the latter to intensive
5798:  quantities. The second sort of combination (nexus) is the synthesis of
5799:  a manifold, in so far as its parts do belong necessarily to each
5800:  other; for example, the accident to a substance, or the effect to the
5801:  cause. Consequently it is a synthesis of that which though
5802:  heterogeneous, is represented as connected à priori. This
5803:  combination—not an arbitrary one—I entitle dynamical because it
5804:  concerns the connection of the existence of the manifold. This, again,
5805:  may be divided into the physical synthesis, of the phenomena divided
5806:  among each other, and the metaphysical synthesis, or the connection of
5807:  phenomena à priori in the faculty of cognition.
5808: 
5809: 
5810: 1. AXIOMS OF INTUITION.
5811: 
5812: The principle of these is: All Intuitions are Extensive Quantities.
5813: 
5814: PROOF.
5815: 
5816: All phenomena contain, as regards their form, an intuition in space and
5817: time, which lies à priori at the foundation of all without exception.
5818: Phenomena, therefore, cannot be apprehended, that is, received into
5819: empirical consciousness otherwise than through the synthesis of a
5820: manifold, through which the representations of a determinate space or
5821: time are generated; that is to say, through the composition of the
5822: homogeneous and the consciousness of the synthetical unity of this
5823: manifold (homogeneous). Now the consciousness of a homogeneous manifold
5824: in intuition, in so far as thereby the representation of an object is
5825: rendered possible, is the conception of a quantity (quanti).
5826: Consequently, even the perception of an object as phenomenon is
5827: possible only through the same synthetical unity of the manifold of the
5828: given sensuous intuition, through which the unity of the composition of
5829: the homogeneous manifold in the conception of a quantity is cogitated;
5830: that is to say, all phenomena are quantities, and extensive quantities,
5831: because as intuitions in space or time they must be represented by
5832: means of the same synthesis through which space and time themselves are
5833: determined.
5834: 
5835: An extensive quantity I call that wherein the representation of the
5836: parts renders possible (and therefore necessarily antecedes) the
5837: representation of the whole. I cannot represent to myself any line,
5838: however small, without drawing it in thought, that is, without
5839: generating from a point all its parts one after another, and in this
5840: way alone producing this intuition. Precisely the same is the case with
5841: every, even the smallest, portion of time. I cogitate therein only the
5842: successive progress from one moment to another, and hence, by means of
5843: the different portions of time and the addition of them, a determinate
5844: quantity of time is produced. As the pure intuition in all phenomena is
5845: either time or space, so is every phenomenon in its character of
5846: intuition an extensive quantity, inasmuch as it can only be cognized in
5847: our apprehension by successive synthesis (from part to part). All
5848: phenomena are, accordingly, to be considered as aggregates, that is, as
5849: a collection of previously given parts; which is not the case with
5850: every sort of quantities, but only with those which are represented and
5851: apprehended by us as extensive.
5852: 
5853: On this successive synthesis of the productive imagination, in the
5854: generation of figures, is founded the mathematics of extension, or
5855: geometry, with its axioms, which express the conditions of sensuous
5856: intuition à priori, under which alone the schema of a pure conception
5857: of external intuition can exist; for example, “be tween two points only
5858: one straight line is possible,” “two straight lines cannot enclose a
5859: space,” etc. These are the axioms which properly relate only to
5860: quantities (quanta) as such.
5861: 
5862: But, as regards the quantity of a thing (quantitas), that is to say,
5863: the answer to the question: “How large is this or that object?”
5864: although, in respect to this question, we have various propositions
5865: synthetical and immediately certain (indemonstrabilia); we have, in the
5866: proper sense of the term, no axioms. For example, the propositions: “If
5867: equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal”; “If equals be taken
5868: from equals, the remainders are equal”; are analytical, because I am
5869: immediately conscious of the identity of the production of the one
5870: quantity with the production of the other; whereas axioms must be à
5871: priori synthetical propositions. On the other hand, the self-evident
5872: propositions as to the relation of numbers, are certainly synthetical
5873: but not universal, like those of geometry, and for this reason cannot
5874: be called axioms, but numerical formulae. That 7 + 5 = 12 is not an
5875: analytical proposition. For neither in the representation of seven, nor
5876: of five, nor of the composition of the two numbers, do I cogitate the
5877: number twelve. (Whether I cogitate the number in the addition of both,
5878: is not at present the question; for in the case of an analytical
5879: proposition, the only point is whether I really cogitate the predicate
5880: in the representation of the subject.) But although the proposition is
5881: synthetical, it is nevertheless only a singular proposition. In so far
5882: as regard is here had merely to the synthesis of the homogeneous (the
5883: units), it cannot take place except in one manner, although our use of
5884: these numbers is afterwards general. If I say: “A triangle can be
5885: constructed with three lines, any two of which taken together are
5886: greater than the third,” I exercise merely the pure function of the
5887: productive imagination, which may draw the lines longer or shorter and
5888: construct the angles at its pleasure. On the contrary, the number seven
5889: is possible only in one manner, and so is likewise the number twelve,
5890: which results from the synthesis of seven and five. Such propositions,
5891: then, cannot be termed axioms (for in that case we should have an
5892: infinity of these), but numerical formulae.
5893: 
5894: This transcendental principle of the mathematics of phenomena greatly
5895: enlarges our à priori cognition. For it is by this principle alone that
5896: pure mathematics is rendered applicable in all its precision to objects
5897: of experience, and without it the validity of this application would
5898: not be so self-evident; on the contrary, contradictions and confusions
5899: have often arisen on this very point. Phenomena are not things in
5900: themselves. Empirical intuition is possible only through pure intuition
5901: (of space and time); consequently, what geometry affirms of the latter,
5902: is indisputably valid of the former. All evasions, such as the
5903: statement that objects of sense do not conform to the rules of
5904: construction in space (for example, to the rule of the infinite
5905: divisibility of lines or angles), must fall to the ground. For, if
5906: these objections hold good, we deny to space, and with it to all
5907: mathematics, objective validity, and no longer know wherefore, and how
5908: far, mathematics can be applied to phenomena. The synthesis of spaces
5909: and times as the essential form of all intuition, is that which renders
5910: possible the apprehension of a phenomenon, and therefore every external
5911: experience, consequently all cognition of the objects of experience;
5912: and whatever mathematics in its pure use proves of the former, must
5913: necessarily hold good of the latter. All objections are but the
5914: chicaneries of an ill-instructed reason, which erroneously thinks to
5915: liberate the objects of sense from the formal conditions of our
5916: sensibility, and represents these, although mere phenomena, as things
5917: in themselves, presented as such to our understanding. But in this
5918: case, no à priori synthetical cognition of them could be possible,
5919: consequently not through pure conceptions of space and the science
5920: which determines these conceptions, that is to say, geometry, would
5921: itself be impossible.
5922: 
5923: 2. ANTICIPATIONS OF PERCEPTION.
5924: 
5925: The principle of these is: In all phenomena the Real, that which is an
5926: object of sensation, has Intensive Quantity, that is, has a Degree.
5927: 
5928: PROOF.
5929: 
5930: Perception is empirical consciousness, that is to say, a consciousness
5931: which contains an element of sensation. Phenomena as objects of
5932: perception are not pure, that is, merely formal intuitions, like space
5933: and time, for they cannot be perceived in themselves.[28] They contain,
5934: then, over and above the intuition, the materials for an object
5935: (through which is represented something existing in space or time),
5936: that is to say, they contain the real of sensation, as a representation
5937: merely subjective, which gives us merely the consciousness that the
5938: subject is affected, and which we refer to some external object. Now, a
5939: gradual transition from empirical consciousness to pure consciousness
5940: is possible, inasmuch as the real in this consciousness entirely
5941: vanishes, and there remains a merely formal consciousness (à priori) of
5942: the manifold in time and space; consequently there is possible a
5943: synthesis also of the production of the quantity of a sensation from
5944: its commencement, that is, from the pure intuition = 0 onwards up to a
5945: certain quantity of the sensation. Now as sensation in itself is not an
5946: objective representation, and in it is to be found neither the
5947: intuition of space nor of time, it cannot possess any extensive
5948: quantity, and yet there does belong to it a quantity (and that by means
5949: of its apprehension, in which empirical consciousness can within a
5950: certain time rise from nothing = 0 up to its given amount),
5951: consequently an intensive quantity. And thus we must ascribe intensive
5952: quantity, that is, a degree of influence on sense to all objects of
5953: perception, in so far as this perception contains sensation.
5954: 
5955:  [28] They can be perceived only as phenomena, and some part of them
5956:  must always belong to the non-ego; whereas pure intuitions are
5957:  entirely the products of the mind itself, and as such are cognized _in
5958:  themselves.—Tr_
5959: 
5960: 
5961: All cognition, by means of which I am enabled to cognize and determine
5962: à priori what belongs to empirical cognition, may be called an
5963: anticipation; and without doubt this is the sense in which Epicurus
5964: employed his expression prholepsis. But as there is in phenomena
5965: something which is never cognized à priori, which on this account
5966: constitutes the proper difference between pure and empirical cognition,
5967: that is to say, sensation (as the matter of perception), it follows,
5968: that sensation is just that element in cognition which cannot be at all
5969: anticipated. On the other hand, we might very well term the pure
5970: determinations in space and time, as well in regard to figure as to
5971: quantity, anticipations of phenomena, because they represent à priori
5972: that which may always be given à posteriori in experience. But suppose
5973: that in every sensation, as sensation in general, without any
5974: particular sensation being thought of, there existed something which
5975: could be cognized à priori, this would deserve to be called
5976: anticipation in a special sense—special, because it may seem surprising
5977: to forestall experience, in that which concerns the matter of
5978: experience, and which we can only derive from itself. Yet such really
5979: is the case here.
5980: 
5981: Apprehension[29], by means of sensation alone, fills only one moment,
5982: that is, if I do not take into consideration a succession of many
5983: sensations. As that in the phenomenon, the apprehension of which is not
5984: a successive synthesis advancing from parts to an entire
5985: representation, sensation has therefore no extensive quantity; the want
5986: of sensation in a moment of time would represent it as empty,
5987: consequently = 0. That which in the empirical intuition corresponds to
5988: sensation is reality (realitas phaenomenon); that which corresponds to
5989: the absence of it, negation = 0. Now every sensation is capable of a
5990: diminution, so that it can decrease, and thus gradually disappear.
5991: Therefore, between reality in a phenomenon and negation, there exists a
5992: continuous concatenation of many possible intermediate sensations, the
5993: difference of which from each other is always smaller than that between
5994: the given sensation and zero, or complete negation. That is to say, the
5995: real in a phenomenon has always a quantity, which however is not
5996: discoverable in apprehension, inasmuch as apprehension take place by
5997: means of mere sensation in one instant, and not by the successive
5998: synthesis of many sensations, and therefore does not progress from
5999: parts to the whole. Consequently, it has a quantity, but not an
6000: extensive quantity.
6001: 
6002:  [29] Apprehension is the Kantian word for preception, in the largest
6003:  sense in which we employ that term. It is the genus which includes
6004:  under i, as species, perception proper and sensation proper—Tr
6005: 
6006: 
6007: Now that quantity which is apprehended only as unity, and in which
6008: plurality can be represented only by approximation to negation = O, I
6009: term intensive quantity. Consequently, reality in a phenomenon has
6010: intensive quantity, that is, a degree. If we consider this reality as
6011: cause (be it of sensation or of another reality in the phenomenon, for
6012: example, a change), we call the degree of reality in its character of
6013: cause a momentum, for example, the momentum of weight; and for this
6014: reason, that the degree only indicates that quantity the apprehension
6015: of which is not successive, but instantaneous. This, however, I touch
6016: upon only in passing, for with causality I have at present nothing to
6017: do.
6018: 
6019: Accordingly, every sensation, consequently every reality in phenomena,
6020: however small it may be, has a degree, that is, an intensive quantity,
6021: which may always be lessened, and between reality and negation there
6022: exists a continuous connection of possible realities, and possible
6023: smaller perceptions. Every colour—for example, red—has a degree, which,
6024: be it ever so small, is never the smallest, and so is it always with
6025: heat, the momentum of weight, etc.
6026: 
6027: This property of quantities, according to which no part of them is the
6028: smallest possible (no part simple), is called their continuity. Space
6029: and time are quanta continua, because no part of them can be given,
6030: without enclosing it within boundaries (points and moments),
6031: consequently, this given part is itself a space or a time. Space,
6032: therefore, consists only of spaces, and time of times. Points and
6033: moments are only boundaries, that is, the mere places or positions of
6034: their limitation. But places always presuppose intuitions which are to
6035: limit or determine them; and we cannot conceive either space or time
6036: composed of constituent parts which are given before space or time.
6037: Such quantities may also be called flowing, because synthesis (of the
6038: productive imagination) in the production of these quantities is a
6039: progression in time, the continuity of which we are accustomed to
6040: indicate by the expression flowing.
6041: 
6042: All phenomena, then, are continuous quantities, in respect both to
6043: intuition and mere perception (sensation, and with it reality). In the
6044: former case they are extensive quantities; in the latter, intensive.
6045: When the synthesis of the manifold of a phenomenon is interrupted,
6046: there results merely an aggregate of several phenomena, and not
6047: properly a phenomenon as a quantity, which is not produced by the mere
6048: continuation of the productive synthesis of a certain kind, but by the
6049: repetition of a synthesis always ceasing. For example, if I call
6050: thirteen dollars a sum or quantity of money, I employ the term quite
6051: correctly, inasmuch as I understand by thirteen dollars the value of a
6052: mark in standard silver, which is, to be sure, a continuous quantity,
6053: in which no part is the smallest, but every part might constitute a
6054: piece of money, which would contain material for still smaller pieces.
6055: If, however, by the words thirteen dollars I understand so many coins
6056: (be their value in silver what it may), it would be quite erroneous to
6057: use the expression a quantity of dollars; on the contrary, I must call
6058: them aggregate, that is, a number of coins. And as in every number we
6059: must have unity as the foundation, so a phenomenon taken as unity is a
6060: quantity, and as such always a continuous quantity (quantum continuum).
6061: 
6062: Now, seeing all phenomena, whether considered as extensive or
6063: intensive, are continuous quantities, the proposition: “All change
6064: (transition of a thing from one state into another) is continuous,”
6065: might be proved here easily, and with mathematical evidence, were it
6066: not that the causality of a change lies, entirely beyond the bounds of
6067: a transcendental philosophy, and presupposes empirical principles. For
6068: of the possibility of a cause which changes the condition of things,
6069: that is, which determines them to the contrary to a certain given
6070: state, the understanding gives us à priori no knowledge; not merely
6071: because it has no insight into the possibility of it (for such insight
6072: is absent in several à priori cognitions), but because the notion of
6073: change concerns only certain determinations of phenomena, which
6074: experience alone can acquaint us with, while their cause lies in the
6075: unchangeable. But seeing that we have nothing which we could here
6076: employ but the pure fundamental conceptions of all possible experience,
6077: among which of course nothing empirical can be admitted, we dare not,
6078: without injuring the unity of our system, anticipate general physical
6079: science, which is built upon certain fundamental experiences.
6080: 
6081: Nevertheless, we are in no want of proofs of the great influence which
6082: the principle above developed exercises in the anticipation of
6083: perceptions, and even in supplying the want of them, so far as to
6084: shield us against the false conclusions which otherwise we might rashly
6085: draw.
6086: 
6087: If all reality in perception has a degree, between which and negation
6088: there is an endless sequence of ever smaller degrees, and if,
6089: nevertheless, every sense must have a determinate degree of receptivity
6090: for sensations; no perception, and consequently no experience is
6091: possible, which can prove, either immediately or mediately, an entire
6092: absence of all reality in a phenomenon; in other words, it is
6093: impossible ever to draw from experience a proof of the existence of
6094: empty space or of empty time. For in the first place, an entire absence
6095: of reality in a sensuous intuition cannot of course be an object of
6096: perception; secondly, such absence cannot be deduced from the
6097: contemplation of any single phenomenon, and the difference of the
6098: degrees in its reality; nor ought it ever to be admitted in explanation
6099: of any phenomenon. For if even the complete intuition of a determinate
6100: space or time is thoroughly real, that is, if no part thereof is empty,
6101: yet because every reality has its degree, which, with the extensive
6102: quantity of the phenomenon unchanged, can diminish through endless
6103: gradations down to nothing (the void), there must be infinitely
6104: graduated degrees, with which space or time is filled, and the
6105: intensive quantity in different phenomena may be smaller or greater,
6106: although the extensive quantity of the intuition remains equal and
6107: unaltered.
6108: 
6109: We shall give an example of this. Almost all natural philosophers,
6110: remarking a great difference in the quantity of the matter of different
6111: kinds in bodies with the same volume (partly on account of the momentum
6112: of gravity or weight, partly on account of the momentum of resistance
6113: to other bodies in motion), conclude unanimously that this volume
6114: (extensive quantity of the phenomenon) must be void in all bodies,
6115: although in different proportion. But who would suspect that these for
6116: the most part mathematical and mechanical inquirers into nature should
6117: ground this conclusion solely on a metaphysical hypothesis—a sort of
6118: hypothesis which they profess to disparage and avoid? Yet this they do,
6119: in assuming that the real in space (I must not here call it
6120: impenetrability or weight, because these are empirical conceptions) is
6121: always identical, and can only be distinguished according to its
6122: extensive quantity, that is, multiplicity. Now to this presupposition,
6123: for which they can have no ground in experience, and which consequently
6124: is merely metaphysical, I oppose a transcendental demonstration, which
6125: it is true will not explain the difference in the filling up of spaces,
6126: but which nevertheless completely does away with the supposed necessity
6127: of the above-mentioned presupposition that we cannot explain the said
6128: difference otherwise than by the hypothesis of empty spaces. This
6129: demonstration, moreover, has the merit of setting the understanding at
6130: liberty to conceive this distinction in a different manner, if the
6131: explanation of the fact requires any such hypothesis. For we perceive
6132: that although two equal spaces may be completely filled by matters
6133: altogether different, so that in neither of them is there left a single
6134: point wherein matter is not present, nevertheless, every reality has
6135: its degree (of resistance or of weight), which, without diminution of
6136: the extensive quantity, can become less and less ad infinitum, before
6137: it passes into nothingness and disappears. Thus an expansion which
6138: fills a space—for example, caloric, or any other reality in the
6139: phenomenal world—can decrease in its degrees to infinity, yet without
6140: leaving the smallest part of the space empty; on the contrary, filling
6141: it with those lesser degrees as completely as another phenomenon could
6142: with greater. My intention here is by no means to maintain that this is
6143: really the case with the difference of matters, in regard to their
6144: specific gravity; I wish only to prove, from a principle of the pure
6145: understanding, that the nature of our perceptions makes such a mode of
6146: explanation possible, and that it is erroneous to regard the real in a
6147: phenomenon as equal quoad its degree, and different only quoad its
6148: aggregation and extensive quantity, and this, too, on the pretended
6149: authority of an à priori principle of the understanding.
6150: 
6151: Nevertheless, this principle of the anticipation of perception must
6152: somewhat startle an inquirer whom initiation into transcendental
6153: philosophy has rendered cautious. We must naturally entertain some
6154: doubt whether or not the understanding can enounce any such synthetical
6155: proposition as that respecting the degree of all reality in phenomena,
6156: and consequently the possibility of the internal difference of
6157: sensation itself—abstraction being made of its empirical quality. Thus
6158: it is a question not unworthy of solution: “How the understanding can
6159: pronounce synthetically and à priori respecting phenomena, and thus
6160: anticipate these, even in that which is peculiarly and merely
6161: empirical, that, namely, which concerns sensation itself?”
6162: 
6163: The quality of sensation is in all cases merely empirical, and cannot
6164: be represented à priori (for example, colours, taste, etc.). But the
6165: real—that which corresponds to sensation—in opposition to negation = 0,
6166: only represents something the conception of which in itself contains a
6167: being (ein seyn), and signifies nothing but the synthesis in an
6168: empirical consciousness. That is to say, the empirical consciousness in
6169: the internal sense can be raised from 0 to every higher degree, so that
6170: the very same extensive quantity of intuition, an illuminated surface,
6171: for example, excites as great a sensation as an aggregate of many other
6172: surfaces less illuminated. We can therefore make complete abstraction
6173: of the extensive quantity of a phenomenon, and represent to ourselves
6174: in the mere sensation in a certain momentum, a synthesis of homogeneous
6175: ascension from 0 up to the given empirical consciousness, All
6176: sensations therefore as such are given only à posteriori, but this
6177: property thereof, namely, that they have a degree, can be known à
6178: priori. It is worthy of remark, that in respect to quantities in
6179: general, we can cognize à priori only a single quality, namely,
6180: continuity; but in respect to all quality (the real in phenomena), we
6181: cannot cognize à priori anything more than the intensive quantity
6182: thereof, namely, that they have a degree. All else is left to
6183: experience.
6184: 
6185: 3. ANALOGIES OF EXPERIENCE.
6186: 
6187: The principle of these is: Experience is possible only through the
6188: representation of a necessary connection of Perceptions.
6189: 
6190: PROOF.
6191: 
6192: Experience is an empirical cognition; that is to say, a cognition which
6193: determines an object by means of perceptions. It is therefore a
6194: synthesis of perceptions, a synthesis which is not itself contained in
6195: perception, but which contains the synthetical unity of the manifold of
6196: perception in a consciousness; and this unity constitutes the essential
6197: of our cognition of objects of the senses, that is, of experience (not
6198: merely of intuition or sensation). Now in experience our perceptions
6199: come together contingently, so that no character of necessity in their
6200: connection appears, or can appear from the perceptions themselves,
6201: because apprehension is only a placing together of the manifold of
6202: empirical intuition, and no representation of a necessity in the
6203: connected existence of the phenomena which apprehension brings
6204: together, is to be discovered therein. But as experience is a cognition
6205: of objects by means of perceptions, it follows that the relation of the
6206: existence of the existence of the manifold must be represented in
6207: experience not as it is put together in time, but as it is objectively
6208: in time. And as time itself cannot be perceived, the determination of
6209: the existence of objects in time can only take place by means of their
6210: connection in time in general, consequently only by means of à priori
6211: connecting conceptions. Now as these conceptions always possess the
6212: character of necessity, experience is possible only by means of a
6213: representation of the necessary connection of perception.
6214: 
6215: The three modi of time are permanence, succession, and coexistence.
6216: Accordingly, there are three rules of all relations of time in
6217: phenomena, according to which the existence of every phenomenon is
6218: determined in respect of the unity of all time, and these antecede all
6219: experience and render it possible.
6220: 
6221: The general principle of all three analogies rests on the necessary
6222: unity of apperception in relation to all possible empirical
6223: consciousness (perception) at every time, consequently, as this unity
6224: lies à priori at the foundation of all mental operations, the principle
6225: rests on the synthetical unity of all phenomena according to their
6226: relation in time. For the original apperception relates to our internal
6227: sense (the complex of all representations), and indeed relates à priori
6228: to its form, that is to say, the relation of the manifold empirical
6229: consciousness in time. Now this manifold must be combined in original
6230: apperception according to relations of time—a necessity imposed by the
6231: à priori transcendental unity of apperception, to which is subjected
6232: all that can belong to my (i.e., my own) cognition, and therefore all
6233: that can become an object for me. This synthetical and à priori
6234: determined unity in relation of perceptions in time is therefore the
6235: rule: “All empirical determinations of time must be subject to rules of
6236: the general determination of time”; and the analogies of experience, of
6237: which we are now about to treat, must be rules of this nature.
6238: 
6239: These principles have this peculiarity, that they do not concern
6240: phenomena, and the synthesis of the empirical intuition thereof, but
6241: merely the existence of phenomena and their relation to each other in
6242: regard to this existence. Now the mode in which we apprehend a thing in
6243: a phenomenon can be determined à priori in such a manner that the rule
6244: of its synthesis can give, that is to say, can produce this à priori
6245: intuition in every empirical example. But the existence of phenomena
6246: cannot be known à priori, and although we could arrive by this path at
6247: a conclusion of the fact of some existence, we could not cognize that
6248: existence determinately, that is to say, we should be incapable of
6249: anticipating in what respect the empirical intuition of it would be
6250: distinguishable from that of others.
6251: 
6252: The two principles above mentioned, which I called mathematical, in
6253: consideration of the fact of their authorizing the application of
6254: mathematic phenomena, relate to these phenomena only in regard to their
6255: possibility, and instruct us how phenomena, as far as regards their
6256: intuition or the real in their perception, can be generated according
6257: to the rules of a mathematical synthesis. Consequently, numerical
6258: quantities, and with them the determination of a phenomenon as a
6259: quantity, can be employed in the one case as well as in the other.
6260: Thus, for example, out of 200,000 illuminations by the moon, I might
6261: compose and give à priori, that is construct, the degree of our
6262: sensations of the sun-light.[30] We may therefore entitle these two
6263: principles constitutive.
6264: 
6265:  [30] Kant’s meaning is: The two principles enunciated under the heads
6266:  of “Axioms of Intuition,” and “Anticipations of Perception,” authorize
6267:  the application to phenomena of determinations of size and number,
6268:  that is of mathematic. For example, I may compute the light of the
6269:  sun, and say that its quantity is a certain number of times greater
6270:  than that of the moon. In the same way, heat is measured by the
6271:  comparison of its different effects on water, &c., and on mercury in a
6272:  thermometer.—Tr
6273: 
6274: 
6275: The case is very different with those principles whose province it is
6276: to subject the existence of phenomena to rules à priori. For as
6277: existence does not admit of being constructed, it is clear that they
6278: must only concern the relations of existence and be merely regulative
6279: principles. In this case, therefore, neither axioms nor anticipations
6280: are to be thought of. Thus, if a perception is given us, in a certain
6281: relation of time to other (although undetermined) perceptions, we
6282: cannot then say à priori, what and how great (in quantity) the other
6283: perception necessarily connected with the former is, but only how it is
6284: connected, quoad its existence, in this given modus of time. Analogies
6285: in philosophy mean something very different from that which they
6286: represent in mathematics. In the latter they are formulae, which
6287: enounce the equality of two relations of quantity, and are always
6288: constitutive, so that if two terms of the proportion are given, the
6289: third is also given, that is, can be constructed by the aid of these
6290: formulae. But in philosophy, analogy is not the equality of two
6291: quantitative but of two qualitative relations. In this case, from three
6292: given terms, I can give à priori and cognize the relation to a fourth
6293: member, but not this fourth term itself, although I certainly possess a
6294: rule to guide me in the search for this fourth term in experience, and
6295: a mark to assist me in discovering it. An analogy of experience is
6296: therefore only a rule according to which unity of experience must arise
6297: out of perceptions in respect to objects (phenomena) not as a
6298: constitutive, but merely as a regulative principle. The same holds good
6299: also of the postulates of empirical thought in general, which relate to
6300: the synthesis of mere intuition (which concerns the form of phenomena),
6301: the synthesis of perception (which concerns the matter of phenomena),
6302: and the synthesis of experience (which concerns the relation of these
6303: perceptions). For they are only regulative principles, and clearly
6304: distinguishable from the mathematical, which are constitutive, not
6305: indeed in regard to the certainty which both possess à priori, but in
6306: the mode of evidence thereof, consequently also in the manner of
6307: demonstration.
6308: 
6309: But what has been observed of all synthetical propositions, and must be
6310: particularly remarked in this place, is this, that these analogies
6311: possess significance and validity, not as principles of the
6312: transcendental, but only as principles of the empirical use of the
6313: understanding, and their truth can therefore be proved only as such,
6314: and that consequently the phenomena must not be subjoined directly
6315: under the categories, but only under their schemata. For if the objects
6316: to which those principles must be applied were things in themselves, it
6317: would be quite impossible to cognize aught concerning them
6318: synthetically à priori. But they are nothing but phenomena; a complete
6319: knowledge of which—a knowledge to which all principles à priori must at
6320: last relate—is the only possible experience. It follows that these
6321: principles can have nothing else for their aim than the conditions of
6322: the empirical cognition in the unity of synthesis of phenomena. But
6323: this synthesis is cogitated only in the schema of the pure conception
6324: of the understanding, of whose unity, as that of a synthesis in
6325: general, the category contains the function unrestricted by any
6326: sensuous condition. These principles will therefore authorize us to
6327: connect phenomena according to an analogy, with the logical and
6328: universal unity of conceptions, and consequently to employ the
6329: categories in the principles themselves; but in the application of them
6330: to experience, we shall use only their schemata, as the key to their
6331: proper application, instead of the categories, or rather the latter as
6332: restricting conditions, under the title of “formulae” of the former.
6333: 
6334: A. FIRST ANALOGY.
6335: 
6336: Principle of the Permanence of Substance.
6337: 
6338: In all changes of phenomena, substance is permanent, and the quantum
6339: thereof in nature is neither increased nor diminished.
6340: 
6341: PROOF.
6342: 
6343: All phenomena exist in time, wherein alone as substratum, that is, as
6344: the permanent form of the internal intuition, coexistence and
6345: succession can be represented. Consequently time, in which all changes
6346: of phenomena must be cogitated, remains and changes not, because it is
6347: that in which succession and coexistence can be represented only as
6348: determinations thereof. Now, time in itself cannot be an object of
6349: perception. It follows that in objects of perception, that is, in
6350: phenomena, there must be found a substratum which represents time in
6351: general, and in which all change or coexistence can be perceived by
6352: means of the relation of phenomena to it. But the substratum of all
6353: reality, that is, of all that pertains to the existence of things, is
6354: substance; all that pertains to existence can be cogitated only as a
6355: determination of substance. Consequently, the permanent, in relation to
6356: which alone can all relations of time in phenomena be determined, is
6357: substance in the world of phenomena, that is, the real in phenomena,
6358: that which, as the substratum of all change, remains ever the same.
6359: Accordingly, as this cannot change in existence, its quantity in nature
6360: can neither be increased nor diminished.
6361: 
6362: Our apprehension of the manifold in a phenomenon is always successive,
6363: is Consequently always changing. By it alone we could, therefore, never
6364: determine whether this manifold, as an object of experience, is
6365: coexistent or successive, unless it had for a foundation something
6366: fixed and permanent, of the existence of which all succession and
6367: coexistence are nothing but so many modes (modi of time). Only in the
6368: permanent, then, are relations of time possible (for simultaneity and
6369: succession are the only relations in time); that is to say, the
6370: permanent is the substratum of our empirical representation of time
6371: itself, in which alone all determination of time is possible.
6372: Permanence is, in fact, just another expression for time, as the
6373: abiding correlate of all existence of phenomena, and of all change, and
6374: of all coexistence. For change does not affect time itself, but only
6375: the phenomena in time (just as coexistence cannot be regarded as a
6376: modus of time itself, seeing that in time no parts are coexistent, but
6377: all successive). If we were to attribute succession to time itself, we
6378: should be obliged to cogitate another time, in which this succession
6379: would be possible. It is only by means of the permanent that existence
6380: in different parts of the successive series of time receives a
6381: quantity, which we entitle duration. For in mere succession, existence
6382: is perpetually vanishing and recommencing, and therefore never has even
6383: the least quantity. Without the permanent, then, no relation in time is
6384: possible. Now, time in itself is not an object of perception;
6385: consequently the permanent in phenomena must be regarded as the
6386: substratum of all determination of time, and consequently also as the
6387: condition of the possibility of all synthetical unity of perceptions,
6388: that is, of experience; and all existence and all change in time can
6389: only be regarded as a mode in the existence of that which abides
6390: unchangeably. Therefore, in all phenomena, the permanent is the object
6391: in itself, that is, the substance (phenomenon); but all that changes or
6392: can change belongs only to the mode of the existence of this substance
6393: or substances, consequently to its determinations.
6394: 
6395: I find that in all ages not only the philosopher, but even the common
6396: understanding, has preposited this permanence as a substratum of all
6397: change in phenomena; indeed, I am compelled to believe that they will
6398: always accept this as an indubitable fact. Only the philosopher
6399: expresses himself in a more precise and definite manner, when he says:
6400: “In all changes in the world, the substance remains, and the accidents
6401: alone are changeable.” But of this decidedly synthetical proposition, I
6402: nowhere meet with even an attempt at proof; nay, it very rarely has the
6403: good fortune to stand, as it deserves to do, at the head of the pure
6404: and entirely à priori laws of nature. In truth, the statement that
6405: substance is permanent, is tautological. For this very permanence is
6406: the ground on which we apply the category of substance to the
6407: phenomenon; and we should have been obliged to prove that in all
6408: phenomena there is something permanent, of the existence of which the
6409: changeable is nothing but a determination. But because a proof of this
6410: nature cannot be dogmatical, that is, cannot be drawn from conceptions,
6411: inasmuch as it concerns a synthetical proposition à priori, and as
6412: philosophers never reflected that such propositions are valid only in
6413: relation to possible experience, and therefore cannot be proved except
6414: by means of a deduction of the possibility of experience, it is no
6415: wonder that while it has served as the foundation of all experience
6416: (for we feel the need of it in empirical cognition), it has never been
6417: supported by proof.
6418: 
6419: A philosopher was asked: “What is the weight of smoke?” He answered:
6420: “Subtract from the weight of the burnt wood the weight of the remaining
6421: ashes, and you will have the weight of the smoke.” Thus he presumed it
6422: to be incontrovertible that even in fire the matter (substance) does
6423: not perish, but that only the form of it undergoes a change. In like
6424: manner was the saying: “From nothing comes nothing,” only another
6425: inference from the principle or permanence, or rather of the
6426: ever-abiding existence of the true subject in phenomena. For if that in
6427: the phenomenon which we call substance is to be the proper substratum
6428: of all determination of time, it follows that all existence in past as
6429: well as in future time, must be determinable by means of it alone.
6430: Hence we are entitled to apply the term substance to a phenomenon, only
6431: because we suppose its existence in all time, a notion which the word
6432: permanence does not fully express, as it seems rather to be referable
6433: to future time. However, the internal necessity perpetually to be, is
6434: inseparably connected with the necessity always to have been, and so
6435: the expression may stand as it is. “Gigni de nihilo nihil; in nihilum
6436: nil posse reverti,”[31] are two propositions which the ancients never
6437: parted, and which people nowadays sometimes mistakenly disjoin, because
6438: they imagine that the propositions apply to objects as things in
6439: themselves, and that the former might be inimical to the dependence
6440: (even in respect of its substance also) of the world upon a supreme
6441: cause. But this apprehension is entirely needless, for the question in
6442: this case is only of phenomena in the sphere of experience, the unity
6443: of which never could be possible, if we admitted the possibility that
6444: new things (in respect of their substance) should arise. For in that
6445: case, we should lose altogether that which alone can represent the
6446: unity of time, to wit, the identity of the substratum, as that through
6447: which alone all change possesses complete and thorough unity. This
6448: permanence is, however, nothing but the manner in which we represent to
6449: ourselves the existence of things in the phenomenal world.
6450: 
6451:  [31] Persius, Satirae, iii.83-84.
6452: 
6453: 
6454: The determinations of a substance, which are only particular modes of
6455: its existence, are called accidents. They are always real, because they
6456: concern the existence of substance (negations are only determinations,
6457: which express the non-existence of something in the substance). Now, if
6458: to this real in the substance we ascribe a particular existence (for
6459: example, to motion as an accident of matter), this existence is called
6460: inherence, in contradistinction to the existence of substance, which we
6461: call subsistence. But hence arise many misconceptions, and it would be
6462: a more accurate and just mode of expression to designate the accident
6463: only as the mode in which the existence of a substance is positively
6464: determined. Meanwhile, by reason of the conditions of the logical
6465: exercise of our understanding, it is impossible to avoid separating, as
6466: it were, that which in the existence of a substance is subject to
6467: change, whilst the substance remains, and regarding it in relation to
6468: that which is properly permanent and radical. On this account, this
6469: category of substance stands under the title of relation, rather
6470: because it is the condition thereof than because it contains in itself
6471: any relation.
6472: 
6473: Now, upon this notion of permanence rests the proper notion of the
6474: conception change. Origin and extinction are not changes of that which
6475: originates or becomes extinct. Change is but a mode of existence, which
6476: follows on another mode of existence of the same object; hence all that
6477: changes is permanent, and only the condition thereof changes. Now since
6478: this mutation affects only determinations, which can have a beginning
6479: or an end, we may say, employing an expression which seems somewhat
6480: paradoxical: “Only the permanent (substance) is subject to change; the
6481: mutable suffers no change, but rather alternation, that is, when
6482: certain determinations cease, others begin.”
6483: 
6484: Change, when, cannot be perceived by us except in substances, and
6485: origin or extinction in an absolute sense, that does not concern merely
6486: a determination of the permanent, cannot be a possible perception, for
6487: it is this very notion of the permanent which renders possible the
6488: representation of a transition from one state into another, and from
6489: non-being to being, which, consequently, can be empirically cognized
6490: only as alternating determinations of that which is permanent. Grant
6491: that a thing absolutely begins to be; we must then have a point of time
6492: in which it was not. But how and by what can we fix and determine this
6493: point of time, unless by that which already exists? For a void
6494: time—preceding—is not an object of perception; but if we connect this
6495: beginning with objects which existed previously, and which continue to
6496: exist till the object in question in question begins to be, then the
6497: latter can only be a determination of the former as the permanent. The
6498: same holds good of the notion of extinction, for this presupposes the
6499: empirical representation of a time, in which a phenomenon no longer
6500: exists.
6501: 
6502: Substances (in the world of phenomena) are the substratum of all
6503: determinations of time. The beginning of some, and the ceasing to be of
6504: other substances, would utterly do away with the only condition of the
6505: empirical unity of time; and in that case phenomena would relate to two
6506: different times, in which, side by side, existence would pass; which is
6507: absurd. For there is only one time in which all different times must be
6508: placed, not as coexistent, but as successive.
6509: 
6510: Accordingly, permanence is a necessary condition under which alone
6511: phenomena, as things or objects, are determinable in a possible
6512: experience. But as regards the empirical criterion of this necessary
6513: permanence, and with it of the substantiality of phenomena, we shall
6514: find sufficient opportunity to speak in the sequel.
6515: 
6516: B. SECOND ANALOGY.
6517: 
6518: Principle of the Succession of Time According to the Law of Causality.
6519: All changes take place according to the law of the connection of Cause
6520: and Effect.
6521: 
6522: PROOF.
6523: 
6524: (That all phenomena in the succession of time are only changes, that
6525: is, a successive being and non-being of the determinations of
6526: substance, which is permanent; consequently that a being of substance
6527: itself which follows on the non-being thereof, or a non-being of
6528: substance which follows on the being thereof, in other words, that the
6529: origin or extinction of substance itself, is impossible—all this has
6530: been fully established in treating of the foregoing principle. This
6531: principle might have been expressed as follows: “All alteration
6532: (succession) of phenomena is merely change”; for the changes of
6533: substance are not origin or extinction, because the conception of
6534: change presupposes the same subject as existing with two opposite
6535: determinations, and consequently as permanent. After this premonition,
6536: we shall proceed to the proof.)
6537: 
6538: I perceive that phenomena succeed one another, that is to say, a state
6539: of things exists at one time, the opposite of which existed in a former
6540: state. In this case, then, I really connect together two perceptions in
6541: time. Now connection is not an operation of mere sense and intuition,
6542: but is the product of a synthetical faculty of imagination, which
6543: determines the internal sense in respect of a relation of time. But
6544: imagination can connect these two states in two ways, so that either
6545: the one or the other may antecede in time; for time in itself cannot be
6546: an object of perception, and what in an object precedes and what
6547: follows cannot be empirically determined in relation to it. I am only
6548: conscious, then, that my imagination places one state before and the
6549: other after; not that the one state antecedes the other in the object.
6550: In other words, the objective relation of the successive phenomena
6551: remains quite undetermined by means of mere perception. Now in order
6552: that this relation may be cognized as determined, the relation between
6553: the two states must be so cogitated that it is thereby determined as
6554: necessary, which of them must be placed before and which after, and not
6555: conversely. But the conception which carries with it a necessity of
6556: synthetical unity, can be none other than a pure conception of the
6557: understanding which does not lie in mere perception; and in this case
6558: it is the conception of “the relation of cause and effect,” the former
6559: of which determines the latter in time, as its necessary consequence,
6560: and not as something which might possibly antecede (or which might in
6561: some cases not be perceived to follow). It follows that it is only
6562: because we subject the sequence of phenomena, and consequently all
6563: change, to the law of causality, that experience itself, that is,
6564: empirical cognition of phenomena, becomes possible; and consequently,
6565: that phenomena themselves, as objects of experience, are possible only
6566: by virtue of this law.
6567: 
6568: Our apprehension of the manifold of phenomena is always successive. The
6569: representations of parts succeed one another. Whether they succeed one
6570: another in the object also, is a second point for reflection, which was
6571: not contained in the former. Now we may certainly give the name of
6572: object to everything, even to every representation, so far as we are
6573: conscious thereof; but what this word may mean in the case of
6574: phenomena, not merely in so far as they (as representations) are
6575: objects, but only in so far as they indicate an object, is a question
6576: requiring deeper consideration. In so far as they, regarded merely as
6577: representations, are at the same time objects of consciousness, they
6578: are not to be distinguished from apprehension, that is, reception into
6579: the synthesis of imagination, and we must therefore say: “The manifold
6580: of phenomena is always produced successively in the mind.” If phenomena
6581: were things in themselves, no man would be able to conjecture from the
6582: succession of our representations how this manifold is connected in the
6583: object; for we have to do only with our representations. How things may
6584: be in themselves, without regard to the representations through which
6585: they affect us, is utterly beyond the sphere of our cognition. Now
6586: although phenomena are not things in themselves, and are nevertheless
6587: the only thing given to us to be cognized, it is my duty to show what
6588: sort of connection in time belongs to the manifold in phenomena
6589: themselves, while the representation of this manifold in apprehension
6590: is always successive. For example, the apprehension of the manifold in
6591: the phenomenon of a house which stands before me, is successive. Now
6592: comes the question whether the manifold of this house is in itself
6593: successive—which no one will be at all willing to grant. But, so soon
6594: as I raise my conception of an object to the transcendental
6595: signification thereof, I find that the house is not a thing in itself,
6596: but only a phenomenon, that is, a representation, the transcendental
6597: object of which remains utterly unknown. What then am I to understand
6598: by the question: “How can the manifold be connected in the phenomenon
6599: itself—not considered as a thing in itself, but merely as a
6600: phenomenon?” Here that which lies in my successive apprehension is
6601: regarded as representation, whilst the phenomenon which is given me,
6602: notwithstanding that it is nothing more than a complex of these
6603: representations, is regarded as the object thereof, with which my
6604: conception, drawn from the representations of apprehension, must
6605: harmonize. It is very soon seen that, as accordance of the cognition
6606: with its object constitutes truth, the question now before us can only
6607: relate to the formal conditions of empirical truth; and that the
6608: phenomenon, in opposition to the representations of apprehension, can
6609: only be distinguished therefrom as the object of them, if it is subject
6610: to a rule which distinguishes it from every other apprehension, and
6611: which renders necessary a mode of connection of the manifold. That in
6612: the phenomenon which contains the condition of this necessary rule of
6613: apprehension, is the object.
6614: 
6615: Let us now proceed to our task. That something happens, that is to say,
6616: that something or some state exists which before was not, cannot be
6617: empirically perceived, unless a phenomenon precedes, which does not
6618: contain in itself this state. For a reality which should follow upon a
6619: void time, in other words, a beginning, which no state of things
6620: precedes, can just as little be apprehended as the void time itself.
6621: Every apprehension of an event is therefore a perception which follows
6622: upon another perception. But as this is the case with all synthesis of
6623: apprehension, as I have shown above in the example of a house, my
6624: apprehension of an event is not yet sufficiently distinguished from
6625: other apprehensions. But I remark also that if in a phenomenon which
6626: contains an occurrence, I call the antecedent state of my perception,
6627: A, and the following state, B, the perception B can only follow A in
6628: apprehension, and the perception A cannot follow B, but only precede
6629: it. For example, I see a ship float down the stream of a river. My
6630: perception of its place lower down follows upon my perception of its
6631: place higher up the course of the river, and it is impossible that, in
6632: the apprehension of this phenomenon, the vessel should be perceived
6633: first below and afterwards higher up the stream. Here, therefore, the
6634: order in the sequence of perceptions in apprehension is determined; and
6635: by this order apprehension is regulated. In the former example, my
6636: perceptions in the apprehension of a house might begin at the roof and
6637: end at the foundation, or vice versa; or I might apprehend the manifold
6638: in this empirical intuition, by going from left to right, and from
6639: right to left. Accordingly, in the series of these perceptions, there
6640: was no determined order, which necessitated my beginning at a certain
6641: point, in order empirically to connect the manifold. But this rule is
6642: always to be met with in the perception of that which happens, and it
6643: makes the order of the successive perceptions in the apprehension of
6644: such a phenomenon necessary.
6645: 
6646: I must, therefore, in the present case, deduce the subjective sequence
6647: of apprehension from the objective sequence of phenomena, for otherwise
6648: the former is quite undetermined, and one phenomenon is not
6649: distinguishable from another. The former alone proves nothing as to the
6650: connection of the manifold in an object, for it is quite arbitrary. The
6651: latter must consist in the order of the manifold in a phenomenon,
6652: according to which order the apprehension of one thing (that which
6653: happens) follows that of another thing (which precedes), in conformity
6654: with a rule. In this way alone can I be authorized to say of the
6655: phenomenon itself, and not merely of my own apprehension, that a
6656: certain order or sequence is to be found therein. That is, in other
6657: words, I cannot arrange my apprehension otherwise than in this order.
6658: 
6659: In conformity with this rule, then, it is necessary that in that which
6660: antecedes an event there be found the condition of a rule, according to
6661: which in this event follows always and necessarily; but I cannot
6662: reverse this and go back from the event, and determine (by
6663: apprehension) that which antecedes it. For no phenomenon goes back from
6664: the succeeding point of time to the preceding point, although it does
6665: certainly relate to a preceding point of time; from a given time, on
6666: the other hand, there is always a necessary progression to the
6667: determined succeeding time. Therefore, because there certainly is
6668: something that follows, I must of necessity connect it with something
6669: else, which antecedes, and upon which it follows, in conformity with a
6670: rule, that is necessarily, so that the event, as conditioned, affords
6671: certain indication of a condition, and this condition determines the
6672: event.
6673: 
6674: Let us suppose that nothing precedes an event, upon which this event
6675: must follow in conformity with a rule. All sequence of perception would
6676: then exist only in apprehension, that is to say, would be merely
6677: subjective, and it could not thereby be objectively determined what
6678: thing ought to precede, and what ought to follow in perception. In such
6679: a case, we should have nothing but a play of representations, which
6680: would possess no application to any object. That is to say, it would
6681: not be possible through perception to distinguish one phenomenon from
6682: another, as regards relations of time; because the succession in the
6683: act of apprehension would always be of the same sort, and therefore
6684: there would be nothing in the phenomenon to determine the succession,
6685: and to render a certain sequence objectively necessary. And, in this
6686: case, I cannot say that two states in a phenomenon follow one upon the
6687: other, but only that one apprehension follows upon another. But this is
6688: merely subjective, and does not determine an object, and consequently
6689: cannot be held to be cognition of an object—not even in the phenomenal
6690: world.
6691: 
6692: Accordingly, when we know in experience that something happens, we
6693: always presuppose that something precedes, whereupon it follows in
6694: conformity with a rule. For otherwise I could not say of the object
6695: that it follows; because the mere succession in my apprehension, if it
6696: be not determined by a rule in relation to something preceding, does
6697: not authorize succession in the object. Only, therefore, in reference
6698: to a rule, according to which phenomena are determined in their
6699: sequence, that is, as they happen, by the preceding state, can I make
6700: my subjective synthesis (of apprehension) objective, and it is only
6701: under this presupposition that even the experience of an event is
6702: possible.
6703: 
6704: No doubt it appears as if this were in thorough contradiction to all
6705: the notions which people have hitherto entertained in regard to the
6706: procedure of the human understanding. According to these opinions, it
6707: is by means of the perception and comparison of similar consequences
6708: following upon certain antecedent phenomena that the understanding is
6709: led to the discovery of a rule, according to which certain events
6710: always follow certain phenomena, and it is only by this process that we
6711: attain to the conception of cause. Upon such a basis, it is clear that
6712: this conception must be merely empirical, and the rule which it
6713: furnishes us with—“Everything that happens must have a cause”—would be
6714: just as contingent as experience itself. The universality and necessity
6715: of the rule or law would be perfectly spurious attributes of it.
6716: Indeed, it could not possess universal validity, inasmuch as it would
6717: not in this case be à priori, but founded on deduction. But the same is
6718: the case with this law as with other pure à priori representations
6719: (e.g., space and time), which we can draw in perfect clearness and
6720: completeness from experience, only because we had already placed them
6721: therein, and by that means, and by that alone, had rendered experience
6722: possible. Indeed, the logical clearness of this representation of a
6723: rule, determining the series of events, is possible only when we have
6724: made use thereof in experience. Nevertheless, the recognition of this
6725: rule, as a condition of the synthetical unity of phenomena in time, was
6726: the ground of experience itself and consequently preceded it à priori.
6727: 
6728: It is now our duty to show by an example that we never, even in
6729: experience, attribute to an object the notion of succession or effect
6730: (of an event—that is, the happening of something that did not exist
6731: before), and distinguish it from the subjective succession of
6732: apprehension, unless when a rule lies at the foundation, which compels
6733: us to observe this order of perception in preference to any other, and
6734: that, indeed, it is this necessity which first renders possible the
6735: representation of a succession in the object.
6736: 
6737: We have representations within us, of which also we can be conscious.
6738: But, however widely extended, however accurate and thoroughgoing this
6739: consciousness may be, these representations are still nothing more than
6740: representations, that is, internal determinations of the mind in this
6741: or that relation of time. Now how happens it that to these
6742: representations we should set an object, or that, in addition to their
6743: subjective reality, as modifications, we should still further attribute
6744: to them a certain unknown objective reality? It is clear that objective
6745: significancy cannot consist in a relation to another representation (of
6746: that which we desire to term object), for in that case the question
6747: again arises: “How does this other representation go out of itself, and
6748: obtain objective significancy over and above the subjective, which is
6749: proper to it, as a determination of a state of mind?” If we try to
6750: discover what sort of new property the relation to an object gives to
6751: our subjective representations, and what new importance they thereby
6752: receive, we shall find that this relation has no other effect than that
6753: of rendering necessary the connection of our representations in a
6754: certain manner, and of subjecting them to a rule; and that conversely,
6755: it is only because a certain order is necessary in the relations of
6756: time of our representations, that objective significancy is ascribed to
6757: them.
6758: 
6759: In the synthesis of phenomena, the manifold of our representations is
6760: always successive. Now hereby is not represented an object, for by
6761: means of this succession, which is common to all apprehension, no one
6762: thing is distinguished from another. But so soon as I perceive or
6763: assume that in this succession there is a relation to a state
6764: antecedent, from which the representation follows in accordance with a
6765: rule, so soon do I represent something as an event, or as a thing that
6766: happens; in other words, I cognize an object to which I must assign a
6767: certain determinate position in time, which cannot be altered, because
6768: of the preceding state in the object. When, therefore, I perceive that
6769: something happens, there is contained in this representation, in the
6770: first place, the fact, that something antecedes; because, it is only in
6771: relation to this that the phenomenon obtains its proper relation of
6772: time, in other words, exists after an antecedent time, in which it did
6773: not exist. But it can receive its determined place in time only by the
6774: presupposition that something existed in the foregoing state, upon
6775: which it follows inevitably and always, that is, in conformity with a
6776: rule. From all this it is evident that, in the first place, I cannot
6777: reverse the order of succession, and make that which happens precede
6778: that upon which it follows; and that, in the second place, if the
6779: antecedent state be posited, a certain determinate event inevitably and
6780: necessarily follows. Hence it follows that there exists a certain order
6781: in our representations, whereby the present gives a sure indication of
6782: some previously existing state, as a correlate, though still
6783: undetermined, of the existing event which is given—a correlate which
6784: itself relates to the event as its consequence, conditions it, and
6785: connects it necessarily with itself in the series of time.
6786: 
6787: If then it be admitted as a necessary law of sensibility, and
6788: consequently a formal condition of all perception, that the preceding
6789: necessarily determines the succeeding time (inasmuch as I cannot arrive
6790: at the succeeding except through the preceding), it must likewise be an
6791: indispensable law of empirical representation of the series of time
6792: that the phenomena of the past determine all phenomena in the
6793: succeeding time, and that the latter, as events, cannot take place,
6794: except in so far as the former determine their existence in time, that
6795: is to say, establish it according to a rule. For it is of course only
6796: in phenomena that we can empirically cognize this continuity in the
6797: connection of times.
6798: 
6799: For all experience and for the possibility of experience, understanding
6800: is indispensable, and the first step which it takes in this sphere is
6801: not to render the representation of objects clear, but to render the
6802: representation of an object in general, possible. It does this by
6803: applying the order of time to phenomena, and their existence. In other
6804: words, it assigns to each phenomenon, as a consequence, a place in
6805: relation to preceding phenomena, determined à priori in time, without
6806: which it could not harmonize with time itself, which determines a place
6807: à priori to all its parts. This determination of place cannot be
6808: derived from the relation of phenomena to absolute time (for it is not
6809: an object of perception); but, on the contrary, phenomena must
6810: reciprocally determine the places in time of one another, and render
6811: these necessary in the order of time. In other words, whatever follows
6812: or happens, must follow in conformity with a universal rule upon that
6813: which was contained in the foregoing state. Hence arises a series of
6814: phenomena, which, by means of the understanding, produces and renders
6815: necessary exactly the same order and continuous connection in the
6816: series of our possible perceptions, as is found à priori in the form of
6817: internal intuition (time), in which all our perceptions must have
6818: place.
6819: 
6820: That something happens, then, is a perception which belongs to a
6821: possible experience, which becomes real only because I look upon the
6822: phenomenon as determined in regard to its place in time, consequently
6823: as an object, which can always be found by means of a rule in the
6824: connected series of my perceptions. But this rule of the determination
6825: of a thing according to succession in time is as follows: “In what
6826: precedes may be found the condition, under which an event always (that
6827: is, necessarily) follows.” From all this it is obvious that the
6828: principle of cause and effect is the principle of possible experience,
6829: that is, of objective cognition of phenomena, in regard to their
6830: relations in the succession of time.
6831: 
6832: The proof of this fundamental proposition rests entirely on the
6833: following momenta of argument. To all empirical cognition belongs the
6834: synthesis of the manifold by the imagination, a synthesis which is
6835: always successive, that is, in which the representations therein always
6836: follow one another. But the order of succession in imagination is not
6837: determined, and the series of successive representations may be taken
6838: retrogressively as well as progressively. But if this synthesis is a
6839: synthesis of apprehension (of the manifold of a given phenomenon), then
6840: the order is determined in the object, or to speak more accurately,
6841: there is therein an order of successive synthesis which determines an
6842: object, and according to which something necessarily precedes, and when
6843: this is posited, something else necessarily follows. If, then, my
6844: perception is to contain the cognition of an event, that is, of
6845: something which really happens, it must be an empirical judgement,
6846: wherein we think that the succession is determined; that is, it
6847: presupposes another phenomenon, upon which this event follows
6848: necessarily, or in conformity with a rule. If, on the contrary, when I
6849: posited the antecedent, the event did not necessarily follow, I should
6850: be obliged to consider it merely as a subjective play of my
6851: imagination, and if in this I represented to myself anything as
6852: objective, I must look upon it as a mere dream. Thus, the relation of
6853: phenomena (as possible perceptions), according to which that which
6854: happens is, as to its existence, necessarily determined in time by
6855: something which antecedes, in conformity with a rule—in other words,
6856: the relation of cause and effect—is the condition of the objective
6857: validity of our empirical judgements in regard to the sequence of
6858: perceptions, consequently of their empirical truth, and therefore of
6859: experience. The principle of the relation of causality in the
6860: succession of phenomena is therefore valid for all objects of
6861: experience, because it is itself the ground of the possibility of
6862: experience.
6863: 
6864: Here, however, a difficulty arises, which must be resolved. The
6865: principle of the connection of causality among phenomena is limited in
6866: our formula to the succession thereof, although in practice we find
6867: that the principle applies also when the phenomena exist together in
6868: the same time, and that cause and effect may be simultaneous. For
6869: example, there is heat in a room, which does not exist in the open air.
6870: I look about for the cause, and find it to be the fire, Now the fire as
6871: the cause is simultaneous with its effect, the heat of the room. In
6872: this case, then, there is no succession as regards time, between cause
6873: and effect, but they are simultaneous; and still the law holds good.
6874: The greater part of operating causes in nature are simultaneous with
6875: their effects, and the succession in time of the latter is produced
6876: only because the cause cannot achieve the total of its effect in one
6877: moment. But at the moment when the effect first arises, it is always
6878: simultaneous with the causality of its cause, because, if the cause had
6879: but a moment before ceased to be, the effect could not have arisen.
6880: Here it must be specially remembered that we must consider the order of
6881: time and not the lapse thereof. The relation remains, even though no
6882: time has elapsed. The time between the causality of the cause and its
6883: immediate effect may entirely vanish, and the cause and effect be thus
6884: simultaneous, but the relation of the one to the other remains always
6885: determinable according to time. If, for example, I consider a leaden
6886: ball, which lies upon a cushion and makes a hollow in it, as a cause,
6887: then it is simultaneous with the effect. But I distinguish the two
6888: through the relation of time of the dynamical connection of both. For
6889: if I lay the ball upon the cushion, then the hollow follows upon the
6890: before smooth surface; but supposing the cushion has, from some cause
6891: or another, a hollow, there does not thereupon follow a leaden ball.
6892: 
6893: Thus, the law of succession of time is in all instances the only
6894: empirical criterion of effect in relation to the causality of the
6895: antecedent cause. The glass is the cause of the rising of the water
6896: above its horizontal surface, although the two phenomena are
6897: contemporaneous. For, as soon as I draw some water with the glass from
6898: a larger vessel, an effect follows thereupon, namely, the change of the
6899: horizontal state which the water had in the large vessel into a
6900: concave, which it assumes in the glass.
6901: 
6902: This conception of causality leads us to the conception of action; that
6903: of action, to the conception of force; and through it, to the
6904: conception of substance. As I do not wish this critical essay, the sole
6905: purpose of which is to treat of the sources of our synthetical
6906: cognition à priori, to be crowded with analyses which merely explain,
6907: but do not enlarge the sphere of our conceptions, I reserve the
6908: detailed explanation of the above conceptions for a future system of
6909: pure reason. Such an analysis, indeed, executed with great
6910: particularity, may already be found in well-known works on this
6911: subject. But I cannot at present refrain from making a few remarks on
6912: the empirical criterion of a substance, in so far as it seems to be
6913: more evident and more easily recognized through the conception of
6914: action than through that of the permanence of a phenomenon.
6915: 
6916: Where action (consequently activity and force) exists, substance also
6917: must exist, and in it alone must be sought the seat of that fruitful
6918: source of phenomena. Very well. But if we are called upon to explain
6919: what we mean by substance, and wish to avoid the vice of reasoning in a
6920: circle, the answer is by no means so easy. How shall we conclude
6921: immediately from the action to the permanence of that which acts, this
6922: being nevertheless an essential and peculiar criterion of substance
6923: (phenomenon)? But after what has been said above, the solution of this
6924: question becomes easy enough, although by the common mode of
6925: procedure—merely analysing our conceptions—it would be quite
6926: impossible. The conception of action indicates the relation of the
6927: subject of causality to the effect. Now because all effect consists in
6928: that which happens, therefore in the changeable, the last subject
6929: thereof is the permanent, as the substratum of all that changes, that
6930: is, substance. For according to the principle of causality, actions are
6931: always the first ground of all change in phenomena and, consequently,
6932: cannot be a property of a subject which itself changes, because if this
6933: were the case, other actions and another subject would be necessary to
6934: determine this change. From all this it results that action alone, as
6935: an empirical criterion, is a sufficient proof of the presence of
6936: substantiality, without any necessity on my part of endeavouring to
6937: discover the permanence of substance by a comparison. Besides, by this
6938: mode of induction we could not attain to the completeness which the
6939: magnitude and strict universality of the conception requires. For that
6940: the primary subject of the causality of all arising and passing away,
6941: all origin and extinction, cannot itself (in the sphere of phenomena)
6942: arise and pass away, is a sound and safe conclusion, a conclusion which
6943: leads us to the conception of empirical necessity and permanence in
6944: existence, and consequently to the conception of a substance as
6945: phenomenon.
6946: 
6947: When something happens, the mere fact of the occurrence, without regard
6948: to that which occurs, is an object requiring investigation. The
6949: transition from the non-being of a state into the existence of it,
6950: supposing that this state contains no quality which previously existed
6951: in the phenomenon, is a fact of itself demanding inquiry. Such an
6952: event, as has been shown in No. A, does not concern substance (for
6953: substance does not thus originate), but its condition or state. It is
6954: therefore only change, and not origin from nothing. If this origin be
6955: regarded as the effect of a foreign cause, it is termed creation, which
6956: cannot be admitted as an event among phenomena, because the very
6957: possibility of it would annihilate the unity of experience. If,
6958: however, I regard all things not as phenomena, but as things in
6959: themselves and objects of understanding alone, they, although
6960: substances, may be considered as dependent, in respect of their
6961: existence, on a foreign cause. But this would require a very different
6962: meaning in the words, a meaning which could not apply to phenomena as
6963: objects of possible experience.
6964: 
6965: How a thing can be changed, how it is possible that upon one state
6966: existing in one point of time, an opposite state should follow in
6967: another point of time—of this we have not the smallest conception à
6968: priori. There is requisite for this the knowledge of real powers, which
6969: can only be given empirically; for example, knowledge of moving forces,
6970: or, in other words, of certain successive phenomena (as movements)
6971: which indicate the presence of such forces. But the form of every
6972: change, the condition under which alone it can take place as the coming
6973: into existence of another state (be the content of the change, that is,
6974: the state which is changed, what it may), and consequently the
6975: succession of the states themselves can very well be considered à
6976: priori, in relation to the law of causality and the conditions of
6977: time.[32]
6978: 
6979:  [32] It must be remarked that I do not speak of the change of certain
6980:  relations, but of the change of the state. Thus, when a body moves in
6981:  a uniform manner, it does not change its state (of motion); but only
6982:  when all motion increases or decreases.
6983: 
6984: 
6985: When a substance passes from one state, a, into another state, b, the
6986: point of time in which the latter exists is different from, and
6987: subsequent to that in which the former existed. In like manner, the
6988: second state, as reality (in the phenomenon), differs from the first,
6989: in which the reality of the second did not exist, as b from zero. That
6990: is to say, if the state, b, differs from the state, a, only in respect
6991: to quantity, the change is a coming into existence of b -a, which in
6992: the former state did not exist, and in relation to which that state is
6993: = O.
6994: 
6995: Now the question arises how a thing passes from one state = a, into
6996: another state = b. Between two moments there is always a certain time,
6997: and between two states existing in these moments there is always a
6998: difference having a certain quantity (for all parts of phenomena are in
6999: their turn quantities). Consequently, every transition from one state
7000: into another is always effected in a time contained between two
7001: moments, of which the first determines the state which leaves, and the
7002: second determines the state into the thing passes. The thing leaves,
7003: and the second determines the state into which the thing Both moments,
7004: then, are limitations of the time of a change, consequently of the
7005: intermediate state between both, and as such they belong to the total
7006: of the change. Now every change has a cause, which evidences its
7007: causality in the whole time during which the charge takes place. The
7008: cause, therefore, does not produce the change all at once or in one
7009: moment, but in a time, so that, as the time gradually increases from
7010: the commencing instant, a, to its completion at b, in like manner also,
7011: the quantity of the reality (b - a) is generated through the lesser
7012: degrees which are contained between the first and last. All change is
7013: therefore possible only through a continuous action of the causality,
7014: which, in so far as it is uniform, we call a momentum. The change does
7015: not consist of these momenta, but is generated or produced by them as
7016: their effect.
7017: 
7018: Such is the law of the continuity of all change, the ground of which is
7019: that neither time itself nor any phenomenon in time consists of parts
7020: which are the smallest possible, but that, notwithstanding, the state
7021: of a thing passes in the process of a change through all these parts,
7022: as elements, to its second state. There is no smallest degree of
7023: reality in a phenomenon, just as there is no smallest degree in the
7024: quantity of time; and so the new state of reality grows up out of the
7025: former state, through all the infinite degrees thereof, the differences
7026: of which one from another, taken all together, are less than the
7027: difference between o and a.
7028: 
7029: It is not our business to inquire here into the utility of this
7030: principle in the investigation of nature. But how such a proposition,
7031: which appears so greatly to extend our knowledge of nature, is possible
7032: completely à priori, is indeed a question which deserves investigation,
7033: although the first view seems to demonstrate the truth and reality of
7034: the principle, and the question, how it is possible, may be considered
7035: superfluous. For there are so many groundless pretensions to the
7036: enlargement of our knowledge by pure reason that we must take it as a
7037: general rule to be mistrustful of all such, and without a thoroughgoing
7038: and radical deduction, to believe nothing of the sort even on the
7039: clearest dogmatical evidence.
7040: 
7041: Every addition to our empirical knowledge, and every advance made in
7042: the exercise of our perception, is nothing more than an extension of
7043: the determination of the internal sense, that is to say, a progression
7044: in time, be objects themselves what they may, phenomena, or pure
7045: intuitions. This progression in time determines everything, and is
7046: itself determined by nothing else. That is to say, the parts of the
7047: progression exist only in time, and by means of the synthesis thereof,
7048: and are not given antecedently to it. For this reason, every transition
7049: in perception to anything which follows upon another in time, is a
7050: determination of time by means of the production of this perception.
7051: And as this determination of time is, always and in all its parts, a
7052: quantity, the perception produced is to be considered as a quantity
7053: which proceeds through all its degrees—no one of which is the smallest
7054: possible—from zero up to its determined degree. From this we perceive
7055: the possibility of cognizing à priori a law of changes—a law, however,
7056: which concerns their form merely. We merely anticipate our own
7057: apprehension, the formal condition of which, inasmuch as it is itself
7058: to be found in the mind antecedently to all given phenomena, must
7059: certainly be capable of being cognized à priori.
7060: 
7061: Thus, as time contains the sensuous condition à priori of the
7062: possibility of a continuous progression of that which exists to that
7063: which follows it, the understanding, by virtue of the unity of
7064: apperception, contains the condition à priori of the possibility of a
7065: continuous determination of the position in time of all phenomena, and
7066: this by means of the series of causes and effects, the former of which
7067: necessitate the sequence of the latter, and thereby render universally
7068: and for all time, and by consequence, objectively, valid the empirical
7069: cognition of the relations of time.
7070: 
7071: C. THIRD ANALOGY.
7072: 
7073: Principle of Coexistence, According to the Law of Reciprocity or
7074: Community.
7075: 
7076: All substances, in so far as they can be perceived in space at the same
7077: time, exist in a state of complete reciprocity of action.
7078: 
7079: PROOF.
7080: 
7081: Things are coexistent, when in empirical intuition the perception of
7082: the one can follow upon the perception of the other, and vice
7083: versa—which cannot occur in the succession of phenomena, as we have
7084: shown in the explanation of the second principle. Thus I can perceive
7085: the moon and then the earth, or conversely, first the earth and then
7086: the moon; and for the reason that my perceptions of these objects can
7087: reciprocally follow each other, I say, they exist contemporaneously.
7088: Now coexistence is the existence of the manifold in the same time. But
7089: time itself is not an object of perception; and therefore we cannot
7090: conclude from the fact that things are placed in the same time, the
7091: other fact, that the perception of these things can follow each other
7092: reciprocally. The synthesis of the imagination in apprehension would
7093: only present to us each of these perceptions as present in the subject
7094: when the other is not present, and contrariwise; but would not show
7095: that the objects are coexistent, that is to say, that, if the one
7096: exists, the other also exists in the same time, and that this is
7097: necessarily so, in order that the perceptions may be capable of
7098: following each other reciprocally. It follows that a conception of the
7099: understanding or category of the reciprocal sequence of the
7100: determinations of phenomena (existing, as they do, apart from each
7101: other, and yet contemporaneously), is requisite to justify us in saying
7102: that the reciprocal succession of perceptions has its foundation in the
7103: object, and to enable us to represent coexistence as objective. But
7104: that relation of substances in which the one contains determinations
7105: the ground of which is in the other substance, is the relation of
7106: influence. And, when this influence is reciprocal, it is the relation
7107: of community or reciprocity. Consequently the coexistence of substances
7108: in space cannot be cognized in experience otherwise than under the
7109: precondition of their reciprocal action. This is therefore the
7110: condition of the possibility of things themselves as objects of
7111: experience.
7112: 
7113: Things are coexistent, in so far as they exist in one and the same
7114: time. But how can we know that they exist in one and the same time?
7115: Only by observing that the order in the synthesis of apprehension of
7116: the manifold is arbitrary and a matter of indifference, that is to say,
7117: that it can proceed from A, through B, C, D, to E, or contrariwise from
7118: E to A. For if they were successive in time (and in the order, let us
7119: suppose, which begins with A), it is quite impossible for the
7120: apprehension in perception to begin with E and go backwards to A,
7121: inasmuch as A belongs to past time and, therefore, cannot be an object
7122: of apprehension.
7123: 
7124: Let us assume that in a number of substances considered as phenomena
7125: each is completely isolated, that is, that no one acts upon another.
7126: Then I say that the coexistence of these cannot be an object of
7127: possible perception and that the existence of one cannot, by any mode
7128: of empirical synthesis, lead us to the existence of another. For we
7129: imagine them in this case to be separated by a completely void space,
7130: and thus perception, which proceeds from the one to the other in time,
7131: would indeed determine their existence by means of a following
7132: perception, but would be quite unable to distinguish whether the one
7133: phenomenon follows objectively upon the first, or is coexistent with
7134: it.
7135: 
7136: Besides the mere fact of existence, then, there must be something by
7137: means of which A determines the position of B in time and, conversely,
7138: B the position of A; because only under this condition can substances
7139: be empirically represented as existing contemporaneously. Now that
7140: alone determines the position of another thing in time which is the
7141: cause of it or of its determinations. Consequently every substance
7142: (inasmuch as it can have succession predicated of it only in respect of
7143: its determinations) must contain the causality of certain
7144: determinations in another substance, and at the same time the effects
7145: of the causality of the other in itself. That is to say, substances
7146: must stand (mediately or immediately) in dynamical community with each
7147: other, if coexistence is to be cognized in any possible experience.
7148: But, in regard to objects of experience, that is absolutely necessary
7149: without which the experience of these objects would itself be
7150: impossible. Consequently it is absolutely necessary that all substances
7151: in the world of phenomena, in so far as they are coexistent, stand in a
7152: relation of complete community of reciprocal action to each other.
7153: 
7154: The word community has in our language[33] two meanings, and contains
7155: the two notions conveyed in the Latin communio and commercium. We
7156: employ it in this place in the latter sense—that of a dynamical
7157: community, without which even the community of place (communio spatii)
7158: could not be empirically cognized. In our experiences it is easy to
7159: observe that it is only the continuous influences in all parts of space
7160: that can conduct our senses from one object to another; that the light
7161: which plays between our eyes and the heavenly bodies produces a
7162: mediating community between them and us, and thereby evidences their
7163: coexistence with us; that we cannot empirically change our position
7164: (perceive this change), unless the existence of matter throughout the
7165: whole of space rendered possible the perception of the positions we
7166: occupy; and that this perception can prove the contemporaneous
7167: existence of these places only through their reciprocal influence, and
7168: thereby also the coexistence of even the most remote objects—although
7169: in this case the proof is only mediate. Without community, every
7170: perception (of a phenomenon in space) is separated from every other and
7171: isolated, and the chain of empirical representations, that is, of
7172: experience, must, with the appearance of a new object, begin entirely
7173: de novo, without the least connection with preceding representations,
7174: and without standing towards these even in the relation of time. My
7175: intention here is by no means to combat the notion of empty space; for
7176: it may exist where our perceptions cannot exist, inasmuch as they
7177: cannot reach thereto, and where, therefore, no empirical perception of
7178: coexistence takes place. But in this case it is not an object of
7179: possible experience.
7180: 
7181:  [33] German
7182: 
7183: 
7184: The following remarks may be useful in the way of explanation. In the
7185: mind, all phenomena, as contents of a possible experience, must exist
7186: in community (communio) of apperception or consciousness, and in so far
7187: as it is requisite that objects be represented as coexistent and
7188: connected, in so far must they reciprocally determine the position in
7189: time of each other and thereby constitute a whole. If this subjective
7190: community is to rest upon an objective basis, or to be applied to
7191: substances as phenomena, the perception of one substance must render
7192: possible the perception of another, and conversely. For otherwise
7193: succession, which is always found in perceptions as apprehensions,
7194: would be predicated of external objects, and their representation of
7195: their coexistence be thus impossible. But this is a reciprocal
7196: influence, that is to say, a real community (commercium) of substances,
7197: without which therefore the empirical relation of coexistence would be
7198: a notion beyond the reach of our minds. By virtue of this commercium,
7199: phenomena, in so far as they are apart from, and nevertheless in
7200: connection with each other, constitute a compositum reale. Such
7201: composita are possible in many different ways. The three dynamical
7202: relations then, from which all others spring, are those of inherence,
7203: consequence, and composition.
7204: 
7205: These, then, are the three analogies of experience. They are nothing
7206: more than principles of the determination of the existence of phenomena
7207: in time, according to the three modi of this determination; to wit, the
7208: relation to time itself as a quantity (the quantity of existence, that
7209: is, duration), the relation in time as a series or succession, finally,
7210: the relation in time as the complex of all existence (simultaneity).
7211: This unity of determination in regard to time is thoroughly dynamical;
7212: that is to say, time is not considered as that in which experience
7213: determines immediately to every existence its position; for this is
7214: impossible, inasmuch as absolute time is not an object of perception,
7215: by means of which phenomena can be connected with each other. On the
7216: contrary, the rule of the understanding, through which alone the
7217: existence of phenomena can receive synthetical unity as regards
7218: relations of time, determines for every phenomenon its position in
7219: time, and consequently à priori, and with validity for all and every
7220: time.
7221: 
7222: By nature, in the empirical sense of the word, we understand the
7223: totality of phenomena connected, in respect of their existence,
7224: according to necessary rules, that is, laws. There are therefore
7225: certain laws (which are moreover à priori) which make nature possible;
7226: and all empirical laws can exist only by means of experience, and by
7227: virtue of those primitive laws through which experience itself becomes
7228: possible. The purpose of the analogies is therefore to represent to us
7229: the unity of nature in the connection of all phenomena under certain
7230: exponents, the only business of which is to express the relation of
7231: time (in so far as it contains all existence in itself) to the unity of
7232: apperception, which can exist in synthesis only according to rules. The
7233: combined expression of all is this: “All phenomena exist in one nature,
7234: and must so exist, inasmuch as without this à priori unity, no unity of
7235: experience, and consequently no determination of objects in experience,
7236: is possible.”
7237: 
7238: As regards the mode of proof which we have employed in treating of
7239: these transcendental laws of nature, and the peculiar character of we
7240: must make one remark, which will at the same time be important as a
7241: guide in every other attempt to demonstrate the truth of intellectual
7242: and likewise synthetical propositions à priori. Had we endeavoured to
7243: prove these analogies dogmatically, that is, from conceptions; that is
7244: to say, had we employed this method in attempting to show that
7245: everything which exists, exists only in that which is permanent—that
7246: every thing or event presupposes the existence of something in a
7247: preceding state, upon which it follows in conformity with a
7248: rule—lastly, that in the manifold, which is coexistent, the states
7249: coexist in connection with each other according to a rule, all our
7250: labour would have been utterly in vain. For more conceptions of things,
7251: analyse them as we may, cannot enable us to conclude from the existence
7252: of one object to the existence of another. What other course was left
7253: for us to pursue? This only, to demonstrate the possibility of
7254: experience as a cognition in which at last all objects must be capable
7255: of being presented to us, if the representation of them is to possess
7256: any objective reality. Now in this third, this mediating term, the
7257: essential form of which consists in the synthetical unity of the
7258: apperception of all phenomena, we found à priori conditions of the
7259: universal and necessary determination as to time of all existences in
7260: the world of phenomena, without which the empirical determination
7261: thereof as to time would itself be impossible, and we also discovered
7262: rules of synthetical unity à priori, by means of which we could
7263: anticipate experience. For want of this method, and from the fancy that
7264: it was possible to discover a dogmatical proof of the synthetical
7265: propositions which are requisite in the empirical employment of the
7266: understanding, has it happened that a proof of the principle of
7267: sufficient reason has been so often attempted, and always in vain. The
7268: other two analogies nobody has ever thought of, although they have
7269: always been silently employed by the mind,[34] because the guiding
7270: thread furnished by the categories was wanting, the guide which alone
7271: can enable us to discover every hiatus, both in the system of
7272: conceptions and of principles.
7273: 
7274:  [34] The unity of the universe, in which all phenomena to be
7275:  connected, is evidently a mere consequence of the admitted principle
7276:  of the community of all substances which are coexistent. For were
7277:  substances isolated, they could not as parts constitute a whole, and
7278:  were their connection (reciprocal action of the manifold) not
7279:  necessary from the very fact of coexistence, we could not conclude
7280:  from the fact of the latter as a merely ideal relation to the former
7281:  as a real one. We have, however, shown in its place that community is
7282:  the proper ground of the possibility of an empirical cognition of
7283:  coexistence, and that we may therefore properly reason from the latter
7284:  to the former as its condition.
7285: 
7286: 
7287: 4. THE POSTULATES OF EMPIRICAL THOUGHT.
7288: 
7289: 1. That which agrees with the formal conditions (intuition and
7290: conception) of experience, is possible.
7291: 
7292: 2. That which coheres with the material conditions of experience
7293: (sensation), is real.
7294: 
7295: 3. That whose coherence with the real is determined according to
7296: universal conditions of experience is (exists) necessary.
7297: 
7298: Explanation.
7299: 
7300: The categories of modality possess this peculiarity, that they do not
7301: in the least determine the object, or enlarge the conception to which
7302: they are annexed as predicates, but only express its relation to the
7303: faculty of cognition. Though my conception of a thing is in itself
7304: complete, I am still entitled to ask whether the object of it is merely
7305: possible, or whether it is also real, or, if the latter, whether it is
7306: also necessary. But hereby the object itself is not more definitely
7307: determined in thought, but the question is only in what relation it,
7308: including all its determinations, stands to the understanding and its
7309: employment in experience, to the empirical faculty of judgement, and to
7310: the reason of its application to experience.
7311: 
7312: For this very reason, too, the categories of modality are nothing more
7313: than explanations of the conceptions of possibility, reality, and
7314: necessity, as employed in experience, and at the same time,
7315: restrictions of all the categories to empirical use alone, not
7316: authorizing the transcendental employment of them. For if they are to
7317: have something more than a merely logical significance, and to be
7318: something more than a mere analytical expression of the form of
7319: thought, and to have a relation to things and their possibility,
7320: reality, or necessity, they must concern possible experience and its
7321: synthetical unity, in which alone objects of cognition can be given.
7322: 
7323: The postulate of the possibility of things requires also, that the
7324: conception of the things agree with the formal conditions of our
7325: experience in general. But this, that is to say, the objective form of
7326: experience, contains all the kinds of synthesis which are requisite for
7327: the cognition of objects. A conception which contains a synthesis must
7328: be regarded as empty and, without reference to an object, if its
7329: synthesis does not belong to experience—either as borrowed from it, and
7330: in this case it is called an empirical conception, or such as is the
7331: ground and à priori condition of experience (its form), and in this
7332: case it is a pure conception, a conception which nevertheless belongs
7333: to experience, inasmuch as its object can be found in this alone. For
7334: where shall we find the criterion or character of the possibility of an
7335: object which is cogitated by means of an à priori synthetical
7336: conception, if not in the synthesis which constitutes the form of
7337: empirical cognition of objects? That in such a conception no
7338: contradiction exists is indeed a necessary logical condition, but very
7339: far from being sufficient to establish the objective reality of the
7340: conception, that is, the possibility of such an object as is thought in
7341: the conception. Thus, in the conception of a figure which is contained
7342: within two straight lines, there is no contradiction, for the
7343: conceptions of two straight lines and of their junction contain no
7344: negation of a figure. The impossibility in such a case does not rest
7345: upon the conception in itself, but upon the construction of it in
7346: space, that is to say, upon the conditions of space and its
7347: determinations. But these have themselves objective reality, that is,
7348: they apply to possible things, because they contain à priori the form
7349: of experience in general.
7350: 
7351: And now we shall proceed to point out the extensive utility and
7352: influence of this postulate of possibility. When I represent to myself
7353: a thing that is permanent, so that everything in it which changes
7354: belongs merely to its state or condition, from such a conception alone
7355: I never can cognize that such a thing is possible. Or, if I represent
7356: to myself something which is so constituted that, when it is posited,
7357: something else follows always and infallibly, my thought contains no
7358: self-contradiction; but whether such a property as causality is to be
7359: found in any possible thing, my thought alone affords no means of
7360: judging. Finally, I can represent to myself different things
7361: (substances) which are so constituted that the state or condition of
7362: one causes a change in the state of the other, and reciprocally; but
7363: whether such a relation is a property of things cannot be perceived
7364: from these conceptions, which contain a merely arbitrary synthesis.
7365: Only from the fact, therefore, that these conceptions express à priori
7366: the relations of perceptions in every experience, do we know that they
7367: possess objective reality, that is, transcendental truth; and that
7368: independent of experience, though not independent of all relation to
7369: form of an experience in general and its synthetical unity, in which
7370: alone objects can be empirically cognized.
7371: 
7372: But when we fashion to ourselves new conceptions of substances, forces,
7373: action, and reaction, from the material presented to us by perception,
7374: without following the example of experience in their connection, we
7375: create mere chimeras, of the possibility of which we cannot discover
7376: any criterion, because we have not taken experience for our
7377: instructress, though we have borrowed the conceptions from her. Such
7378: fictitious conceptions derive their character of possibility not, like
7379: the categories, à priori, as conceptions on which all experience
7380: depends, but only, à posteriori, as conceptions given by means of
7381: experience itself, and their possibility must either be cognized à
7382: posteriori and empirically, or it cannot be cognized at all. A
7383: substance which is permanently present in space, yet without filling it
7384: (like that tertium quid between matter and the thinking subject which
7385: some have tried to introduce into metaphysics), or a peculiar
7386: fundamental power of the mind of intuiting the future by anticipation
7387: (instead of merely inferring from past and present events), or,
7388: finally, a power of the mind to place itself in community of thought
7389: with other men, however distant they may be—these are conceptions the
7390: possibility of which has no ground to rest upon. For they are not based
7391: upon experience and its known laws; and, without experience, they are a
7392: merely arbitrary conjunction of thoughts, which, though containing no
7393: internal contradiction, has no claim to objective reality, neither,
7394: consequently, to the possibility of such an object as is thought in
7395: these conceptions. As far as concerns reality, it is self-evident that
7396: we cannot cogitate such a possibility in concreto without the aid of
7397: experience; because reality is concerned only with sensation, as the
7398: matter of experience, and not with the form of thought, with which we
7399: can no doubt indulge in shaping fancies.
7400: 
7401: But I pass by everything which derives its possibility from reality in
7402: experience, and I purpose treating here merely of the possibility of
7403: things by means of à priori conceptions. I maintain, then, that the
7404: possibility of things is not derived from such conceptions per se, but
7405: only when considered as formal and objective conditions of an
7406: experience in general.
7407: 
7408: It seems, indeed, as if the possibility of a triangle could be cognized
7409: from the conception of it alone (which is certainly independent of
7410: experience); for we can certainly give to the conception a
7411: corresponding object completely à priori, that is to say, we can
7412: construct it. But as a triangle is only the form of an object, it must
7413: remain a mere product of the imagination, and the possibility of the
7414: existence of an object corresponding to it must remain doubtful, unless
7415: we can discover some other ground, unless we know that the figure can
7416: be cogitated under the conditions upon which all objects of experience
7417: rest. Now, the facts that space is a formal condition à priori of
7418: external experience, that the formative synthesis, by which we
7419: construct a triangle in imagination, is the very same as that we employ
7420: in the apprehension of a phenomenon for the purpose of making an
7421: empirical conception of it, are what alone connect the notion of the
7422: possibility of such a thing, with the conception of it. In the same
7423: manner, the possibility of continuous quantities, indeed of quantities
7424: in general, for the conceptions of them are without exception
7425: synthetical, is never evident from the conceptions in themselves, but
7426: only when they are considered as the formal conditions of the
7427: determination of objects in experience. And where, indeed, should we
7428: look for objects to correspond to our conceptions, if not in
7429: experience, by which alone objects are presented to us? It is, however,
7430: true that without antecedent experience we can cognize and characterize
7431: the possibility of things, relatively to the formal conditions, under
7432: which something is determined in experience as an object, consequently,
7433: completely à priori. But still this is possible only in relation to
7434: experience and within its limits.
7435: 
7436: The postulate concerning the cognition of the reality of things
7437: requires perception, consequently conscious sensation, not indeed
7438: immediately, that is, of the object itself, whose existence is to be
7439: cognized, but still that the object have some connection with a real
7440: perception, in accordance with the analogies of experience, which
7441: exhibit all kinds of real connection in experience.
7442: 
7443: From the mere conception of a thing it is impossible to conclude its
7444: existence. For, let the conception be ever so complete, and containing
7445: a statement of all the determinations of the thing, the existence of it
7446: has nothing to do with all this, but only with thew question whether
7447: such a thing is given, so that the perception of it can in every case
7448: precede the conception. For the fact that the conception of it precedes
7449: the perception, merely indicates the possibility of its existence; it
7450: is perception which presents matter to the conception, that is the sole
7451: criterion of reality. Prior to the perception of the thing, however,
7452: and therefore comparatively à priori, we are able to cognize its
7453: existence, provided it stands in connection with some perceptions
7454: according to the principles of the empirical conjunction of these, that
7455: is, in conformity with the analogies of perception. For, in this case,
7456: the existence of the supposed thing is connected with our perception in
7457: a possible experience, and we are able, with the guidance of these
7458: analogies, to reason in the series of possible perceptions from a thing
7459: which we do really perceive to the thing we do not perceive. Thus, we
7460: cognize the existence of a magnetic matter penetrating all bodies from
7461: the perception of the attraction of the steel-filings by the magnet,
7462: although the constitution of our organs renders an immediate perception
7463: of this matter impossible for us. For, according to the laws of
7464: sensibility and the connected context of our perceptions, we should in
7465: an experience come also on an immediate empirical intuition of this
7466: matter, if our senses were more acute—but this obtuseness has no
7467: influence upon and cannot alter the form of possible experience in
7468: general. Our knowledge of the existence of things reaches as far as our
7469: perceptions, and what may be inferred from them according to empirical
7470: laws, extend. If we do not set out from experience, or do not proceed
7471: according to the laws of the empirical connection of phenomena, our
7472: pretensions to discover the existence of a thing which we do not
7473: immediately perceive are vain. Idealism, however, brings forward
7474: powerful objections to these rules for proving existence mediately.
7475: This is, therefore, the proper place for its refutation.
7476: 
7477: REFUTATION OF IDEALISM.
7478: 
7479: Idealism—I mean material idealism—is the theory which declares the
7480: existence of objects in space without us to be either () doubtful and
7481: indemonstrable, or (2) false and impossible. The first is the
7482: problematical idealism of Descartes, who admits the undoubted certainty
7483: of only one empirical assertion (assertio), to wit, “I am.” The second
7484: is the dogmatical idealism of Berkeley, who maintains that space,
7485: together with all the objects of which it is the inseparable condition,
7486: is a thing which is in itself impossible, and that consequently the
7487: objects in space are mere products of the imagination. The dogmatical
7488: theory of idealism is unavoidable, if we regard space as a property of
7489: things in themselves; for in that case it is, with all to which it
7490: serves as condition, a nonentity. But the foundation for this kind of
7491: idealism we have already destroyed in the transcendental æsthetic.
7492: Problematical idealism, which makes no such assertion, but only alleges
7493: our incapacity to prove the existence of anything besides ourselves by
7494: means of immediate experience, is a theory rational and evidencing a
7495: thorough and philosophical mode of thinking, for it observes the rule
7496: not to form a decisive judgement before sufficient proof be shown. The
7497: desired proof must therefore demonstrate that we have experience of
7498: external things, and not mere fancies. For this purpose, we must prove,
7499: that our internal and, to Descartes, indubitable experience is itself
7500: possible only under the previous assumption of external experience.
7501: 
7502: THEOREM.
7503: 
7504: The simple but empirically determined consciousness of my own existence
7505: proves the existence of external objects in space.
7506: 
7507: PROOF
7508: 
7509: I am conscious of my own existence as determined in time. All
7510: determination in regard to time presupposes the existence of something
7511: permanent in perception. But this permanent something cannot be
7512: something in me, for the very reason that my existence in time is
7513: itself determined by this permanent something. It follows that the
7514: perception of this permanent existence is possible only through a thing
7515: without me and not through the mere representation of a thing without
7516: me. Consequently, the determination of my existence in time is possible
7517: only through the existence of real things external to me. Now,
7518: consciousness in time is necessarily connected with the consciousness
7519: of the possibility of this determination in time. Hence it follows that
7520: consciousness in time is necessarily connected also with the existence
7521: of things without me, inasmuch as the existence of these things is the
7522: condition of determination in time. That is to say, the consciousness
7523: of my own existence is at the same time an immediate consciousness of
7524: the existence of other things without me.
7525: 
7526: Remark I. The reader will observe, that in the foregoing proof the game
7527: which idealism plays is retorted upon itself, and with more justice. It
7528: assumed that the only immediate experience is internal and that from
7529: this we can only infer the existence of external things. But, as always
7530: happens, when we reason from given effects to determined causes,
7531: idealism has reasoned with too much haste and uncertainty, for it is
7532: quite possible that the cause of our representations may lie in
7533: ourselves, and that we ascribe it falsely to external things. But our
7534: proof shows that external experience is properly immediate,[35] that
7535: only by virtue of it—not, indeed, the consciousness of our own
7536: existence, but certainly the determination of our existence in time,
7537: that is, internal experience—is possible. It is true, that the
7538: representation “I am,” which is the expression of the consciousness
7539: which can accompany all my thoughts, is that which immediately includes
7540: the existence of a subject. But in this representation we cannot find
7541: any knowledge of the subject, and therefore also no empirical
7542: knowledge, that is, experience. For experience contains, in addition to
7543: the thought of something existing, intuition, and in this case it must
7544: be internal intuition, that is, time, in relation to which the subject
7545: must be determined. But the existence of external things is absolutely
7546: requisite for this purpose, so that it follows that internal experience
7547: is itself possible only mediately and through external experience.
7548: 
7549:  [35] The immediate consciousness of the existence of external things
7550:  is, in the preceding theorem, not presupposed, but proved, by the
7551:  possibility of this consciousness understood by us or not. The
7552:  question as to the possibility of it would stand thus: “Have we an
7553:  internal sense, but no external sense, and is our belief in external
7554:  perception a mere delusion?” But it is evident that, in order merely
7555:  to fancy to ourselves anything as external, that is, to present it to
7556:  the sense in intuition we must already possess an external sense, and
7557:  must thereby distinguish immediately the mere receptivity of an
7558:  external intuition from the spontaneity which characterizes every act
7559:  of imagination. For merely to imagine also an external sense, would
7560:  annihilate the faculty of intuition itself which is to be determined
7561:  by the imagination.
7562: 
7563: 
7564: Remark II. Now with this view all empirical use of our faculty of
7565: cognition in the determination of time is in perfect accordance. Its
7566: truth is supported by the fact that it is possible to perceive a
7567: determination of time only by means of a change in external relations
7568: (motion) to the permanent in space (for example, we become aware of the
7569: sun’s motion by observing the changes of his relation to the objects of
7570: this earth). But this is not all. We find that we possess nothing
7571: permanent that can correspond and be submitted to the conception of a
7572: substance as intuition, except matter. This idea of permanence is not
7573: itself derived from external experience, but is an à priori necessary
7574: condition of all determination of time, consequently also of the
7575: internal sense in reference to our own existence, and that through the
7576: existence of external things. In the representation “I,” the
7577: consciousness of myself is not an intuition, but a merely intellectual
7578: representation produced by the spontaneous activity of a thinking
7579: subject. It follows, that this “i” has not any predicate of intuition,
7580: which, in its character of permanence, could serve as correlate to the
7581: determination of time in the internal sense—in the same way as
7582: impenetrability is the correlate of matter as an empirical intuition.
7583: 
7584: Remark III. From the fact that the existence of external things is a
7585: necessary condition of the possibility of a determined consciousness of
7586: ourselves, it does not follow that every intuitive representation of
7587: external things involves the existence of these things, for their
7588: representations may very well be the mere products of the imagination
7589: (in dreams as well as in madness); though, indeed, these are themselves
7590: created by the reproduction of previous external perceptions, which, as
7591: has been shown, are possible only through the reality of external
7592: objects. The sole aim of our remarks has, however, been to prove that
7593: internal experience in general is possible only through external
7594: experience in general. Whether this or that supposed experience be
7595: purely imaginary must be discovered from its particular determinations
7596: and by comparing these with the criteria of all real experience.
7597: 
7598: Finally, as regards the third postulate, it applies to material
7599: necessity in existence, and not to merely formal and logical necessity
7600: in the connection of conceptions. Now as we cannot cognize completely à
7601: priori the existence of any object of sense, though we can do so
7602: comparatively à priori, that is, relatively to some other previously
7603: given existence—a cognition, however, which can only be of such an
7604: existence as must be contained in the complex of experience, of which
7605: the previously given perception is a part—the necessity of existence
7606: can never be cognized from conceptions, but always, on the contrary,
7607: from its connection with that which is an object of perception. But the
7608: only existence cognized, under the condition of other given phenomena,
7609: as necessary, is the existence of effects from given causes in
7610: conformity with the laws of causality. It is consequently not the
7611: necessity of the existence of things (as substances), but the necessity
7612: of the state of things that we cognize, and that not immediately, but
7613: by means of the existence of other states given in perception,
7614: according to empirical laws of causality. Hence it follows that the
7615: criterion of necessity is to be found only in the law of possible
7616: experience—that everything which happens is determined à priori in the
7617: phenomenon by its cause. Thus we cognize only the necessity of effects
7618: in nature, the causes of which are given us. Moreover, the criterion of
7619: necessity in existence possesses no application beyond the field of
7620: possible experience, and even in this it is not valid of the existence
7621: of things as substances, because these can never be considered as
7622: empirical effects, or as something that happens and has a beginning.
7623: Necessity, therefore, regards only the relations of phenomena according
7624: to the dynamical law of causality, and the possibility grounded
7625: thereon, of reasoning from some given existence (of a cause) à priori
7626: to another existence (of an effect). “Everything that happens is
7627: hypothetically necessary,” is a principle which subjects the changes
7628: that take place in the world to a law, that is, to a rule of necessary
7629: existence, without which nature herself could not possibly exist. Hence
7630: the proposition, “Nothing happens by blind chance (in mundo non datur
7631: casus),” is an à priori law of nature. The case is the same with the
7632: proposition, “Necessity in nature is not blind,” that is, it is
7633: conditioned, consequently intelligible necessity (non datur fatum).
7634: Both laws subject the play of change to “a nature of things (as
7635: phenomena),” or, which is the same thing, to the unity of the
7636: understanding, and through the understanding alone can changes belong
7637: to an experience, as the synthetical unity of phenomena. Both belong to
7638: the class of dynamical principles. The former is properly a consequence
7639: of the principle of causality—one of the analogies of experience. The
7640: latter belongs to the principles of modality, which to the
7641: determination of causality adds the conception of necessity, which is
7642: itself, however, subject to a rule of the understanding. The principle
7643: of continuity forbids any leap in the series of phenomena regarded as
7644: changes (in mundo non datur saltus); and likewise, in the complex of
7645: all empirical intuitions in space, any break or hiatus between two
7646: phenomena (non datur hiatus)—for we can so express the principle, that
7647: experience can admit nothing which proves the existence of a vacuum, or
7648: which even admits it as a part of an empirical synthesis. For, as
7649: regards a vacuum or void, which we may cogitate as out and beyond the
7650: field of possible experience (the world), such a question cannot come
7651: before the tribunal of mere understanding, which decides only upon
7652: questions that concern the employment of given phenomena for the
7653: construction of empirical cognition. It is rather a problem for ideal
7654: reason, which passes beyond the sphere of a possible experience and
7655: aims at forming a judgement of that which surrounds and circumscribes
7656: it, and the proper place for the consideration of it is the
7657: transcendental dialectic. These four propositions, “In mundo non datur
7658: hiatus, non datur saltus, non datur casus, non datur fatum,” as well as
7659: all principles of transcendental origin, we could very easily exhibit
7660: in their proper order, that is, in conformity with the order of the
7661: categories, and assign to each its proper place. But the already
7662: practised reader will do this for himself, or discover the clue to such
7663: an arrangement. But the combined result of all is simply this, to admit
7664: into the empirical synthesis nothing which might cause a break in or be
7665: foreign to the understanding and the continuous connection of all
7666: phenomena, that is, the unity of the conceptions of the understanding.
7667: For in the understanding alone is the unity of experience, in which all
7668: perceptions must have their assigned place, possible.
7669: 
7670: Whether the field of possibility be greater than that of reality, and
7671: whether the field of the latter be itself greater than that of
7672: necessity, are interesting enough questions, and quite capable of
7673: synthetic solution, questions, however, which come under the
7674: jurisdiction of reason alone. For they are tantamount to asking whether
7675: all things as phenomena do without exception belong to the complex and
7676: connected whole of a single experience, of which every given perception
7677: is a part which therefore cannot be conjoined with any other
7678: phenomena—or, whether my perceptions can belong to more than one
7679: possible experience? The understanding gives to experience, according
7680: to the subjective and formal conditions, of sensibility as well as of
7681: apperception, the rules which alone make this experience possible.
7682: Other forms of intuition besides those of space and time, other forms
7683: of understanding besides the discursive forms of thought, or of
7684: cognition by means of conceptions, we can neither imagine nor make
7685: intelligible to ourselves; and even if we could, they would still not
7686: belong to experience, which is the only mode of cognition by which
7687: objects are presented to us. Whether other perceptions besides those
7688: which belong to the total of our possible experience, and consequently
7689: whether some other sphere of matter exists, the understanding has no
7690: power to decide, its proper occupation being with the synthesis of that
7691: which is given. Moreover, the poverty of the usual arguments which go
7692: to prove the existence of a vast sphere of possibility, of which all
7693: that is real (every object of experience) is but a small part, is very
7694: remarkable. “All real is possible”; from this follows naturally,
7695: according to the logical laws of conversion, the particular
7696: proposition: “Some possible is real.” Now this seems to be equivalent
7697: to: “Much is possible that is not real.” No doubt it does seem as if we
7698: ought to consider the sum of the possible to be greater than that of
7699: the real, from the fact that something must be added to the former to
7700: constitute the latter. But this notion of adding to the possible is
7701: absurd. For that which is not in the sum of the possible, and
7702: consequently requires to be added to it, is manifestly impossible. In
7703: addition to accordance with the formal conditions of experience, the
7704: understanding requires a connection with some perception; but that
7705: which is connected with this perception is real, even although it is
7706: not immediately perceived. But that another series of phenomena, in
7707: complete coherence with that which is given in perception, consequently
7708: more than one all-embracing experience is possible, is an inference
7709: which cannot be concluded from the data given us by experience, and
7710: still less without any data at all. That which is possible only under
7711: conditions which are themselves merely possible, is not possible in any
7712: respect. And yet we can find no more certain ground on which to base
7713: the discussion of the question whether the sphere of possibility is
7714: wider than that of experience.
7715: 
7716: I have merely mentioned these questions, that in treating of the
7717: conception of the understanding, there might be no omission of anything
7718: that, in the common opinion, belongs to them. In reality, however, the
7719: notion of absolute possibility (possibility which is valid in every
7720: respect) is not a mere conception of the understanding, which can be
7721: employed empirically, but belongs to reason alone, which passes the
7722: bounds of all empirical use of the understanding. We have, therefore,
7723: contented ourselves with a merely critical remark, leaving the subject
7724: to be explained in the sequel.
7725: 
7726: Before concluding this fourth section, and at the same time the system
7727: of all principles of the pure understanding, it seems proper to mention
7728: the reasons which induced me to term the principles of modality
7729: postulates. This expression I do not here use in the sense which some
7730: more recent philosophers, contrary to its meaning with mathematicians,
7731: to whom the word properly belongs, attach to it—that of a proposition,
7732: namely, immediately certain, requiring neither deduction nor proof. For
7733: if, in the case of synthetical propositions, however evident they may
7734: be, we accord to them without deduction, and merely on the strength of
7735: their own pretensions, unqualified belief, all critique of the
7736: understanding is entirely lost; and, as there is no want of bold
7737: pretensions, which the common belief (though for the philosopher this
7738: is no credential) does not reject, the understanding lies exposed to
7739: every delusion and conceit, without the power of refusing its assent to
7740: those assertions, which, though illegitimate, demand acceptance as
7741: veritable axioms. When, therefore, to the conception of a thing an à
7742: priori determination is synthetically added, such a proposition must
7743: obtain, if not a proof, at least a deduction of the legitimacy of its
7744: assertion.
7745: 
7746: The principles of modality are, however, not objectively synthetical,
7747: for the predicates of possibility, reality, and necessity do not in the
7748: least augment the conception of that of which they are affirmed,
7749: inasmuch as they contribute nothing to the representation of the
7750: object. But as they are, nevertheless, always synthetical, they are so
7751: merely subjectively. That is to say, they have a reflective power, and
7752: apply to the conception of a thing, of which, in other respects, they
7753: affirm nothing, the faculty of cognition in which the conception
7754: originates and has its seat. So that if the conception merely agree
7755: with the formal conditions of experience, its object is called
7756: possible; if it is in connection with perception, and determined
7757: thereby, the object is real; if it is determined according to
7758: conceptions by means of the connection of perceptions, the object is
7759: called necessary. The principles of modality therefore predicate of a
7760: conception nothing more than the procedure of the faculty of cognition
7761: which generated it. Now a postulate in mathematics is a practical
7762: proposition which contains nothing but the synthesis by which we
7763: present an object to ourselves, and produce the conception of it, for
7764: example—“With a given line, to describe a circle upon a plane, from a
7765: given point”; and such a proposition does not admit of proof, because
7766: the procedure, which it requires, is exactly that by which alone it is
7767: possible to generate the conception of such a figure. With the same
7768: right, accordingly, can we postulate the principles of modality,
7769: because they do not augment[36] the conception of a thing but merely
7770: indicate the manner in which it is connected with the faculty of
7771: cognition.
7772: 
7773:  [36] When I think the reality of a thing, I do really think more than
7774:  the possibility, but not in the thing; for that can never contain more
7775:  in reality than was contained in its complete possibility. But while
7776:  the notion of possibility is merely the notion of a position of thing
7777:  in relation to the understanding (its empirical use), reality is the
7778:  conjunction of the thing with perception.
7779: 
7780: 
7781: GENERAL REMARK ON THE SYSTEM OF PRINCIPLES.
7782: 
7783: It is very remarkable that we cannot perceive the possibility of a
7784: thing from the category alone, but must always have an intuition, by
7785: which to make evident the objective reality of the pure conception of
7786: the understanding. Take, for example, the categories of relation. How
7787: (1) a thing can exist only as a subject, and not as a mere
7788: determination of other things, that is, can be substance; or how (2),
7789: because something exists, some other thing must exist, consequently how
7790: a thing can be a cause; or how (3), when several things exist, from the
7791: fact that one of these things exists, some consequence to the others
7792: follows, and reciprocally, and in this way a community of substances
7793: can be possible—are questions whose solution cannot be obtained from
7794: mere conceptions. The very same is the case with the other categories;
7795: for example, how a thing can be of the same sort with many others, that
7796: is, can be a quantity, and so on. So long as we have not intuition we
7797: cannot know whether we do really think an object by the categories, and
7798: where an object can anywhere be found to cohere with them, and thus the
7799: truth is established, that the categories are not in themselves
7800: cognitions, but mere forms of thought for the construction of
7801: cognitions from given intuitions. For the same reason is it true that
7802: from categories alone no synthetical proposition can be made. For
7803: example: “In every existence there is substance,” that is, something
7804: that can exist only as a subject and not as mere predicate; or,
7805: “Everything is a quantity”—to construct propositions such as these, we
7806: require something to enable us to go out beyond the given conception
7807: and connect another with it. For the same reason the attempt to prove a
7808: synthetical proposition by means of mere conceptions, for example:
7809: “Everything that exists contingently has a cause,” has never succeeded.
7810: We could never get further than proving that, without this relation to
7811: conceptions, we could not conceive the existence of the contingent,
7812: that is, could not à priori through the understanding cognize the
7813: existence of such a thing; but it does not hence follow that this is
7814: also the condition of the possibility of the thing itself that is said
7815: to be contingent. If, accordingly; we look back to our proof of the
7816: principle of causality, we shall find that we were able to prove it as
7817: valid only of objects of possible experience, and, indeed, only as
7818: itself the principle of the possibility of experience, Consequently of
7819: the cognition of an object given in empirical intuition, and not from
7820: mere conceptions. That, however, the proposition: “Everything that is
7821: contingent must have a cause,” is evident to every one merely from
7822: conceptions, is not to be denied. But in this case the conception of
7823: the contingent is cogitated as involving not the category of modality
7824: (as that the non-existence of which can be conceived) but that of
7825: relation (as that which can exist only as the consequence of something
7826: else), and so it is really an identical proposition: “That which can
7827: exist only as a consequence, has a cause.” In fact, when we have to
7828: give examples of contingent existence, we always refer to changes, and
7829: not merely to the possibility of conceiving the opposite.[37] But
7830: change is an event, which, as such, is possible only through a cause,
7831: and considered per se its non-existence is therefore possible, and we
7832: become cognizant of its contingency from the fact that it can exist
7833: only as the effect of a cause. Hence, if a thing is assumed to be
7834: contingent, it is an analytical proposition to say, it has a cause.
7835: 
7836:  [37] We can easily conceive the non-existence of matter; but the
7837:  ancients did not thence infer its contingency. But even the
7838:  alternation of the existence and non-existence of a given state in a
7839:  thing, in which all change consists, by no means proves the
7840:  contingency of that state—the ground of proof being the reality of its
7841:  opposite. For example, a body is in a state of rest after motion, but
7842:  we cannot infer the contingency of the motion from the fact that the
7843:  former is the opposite of the latter. For this opposite is merely a
7844:  logical and not a real opposite to the other. If we wish to
7845:  demonstrate the contingency of the motion, what we ought to prove is
7846:  that, instead of the motion which took place in the preceding point of
7847:  time, it was possible for the body to have been then in rest, not,
7848:  that it is afterwards in rest; for in this case, both opposites are
7849:  perfectly consistent with each other.
7850: 
7851: 
7852: But it is still more remarkable that, to understand the possibility of
7853: things according to the categories and thus to demonstrate the
7854: objective reality of the latter, we require not merely intuitions, but
7855: external intuitions. If, for example, we take the pure conceptions of
7856: relation, we find that (1) for the purpose of presenting to the
7857: conception of substance something permanent in intuition corresponding
7858: thereto and thus of demonstrating the objective reality of this
7859: conception, we require an intuition (of matter) in space, because space
7860: alone is permanent and determines things as such, while time, and with
7861: it all that is in the internal sense, is in a state of continual flow;
7862: (2) in order to represent change as the intuition corresponding to the
7863: conception of causality, we require the representation of motion as
7864: change in space; in fact, it is through it alone that changes, the
7865: possibility of which no pure understanding can perceive, are capable of
7866: being intuited. Change is the connection of determinations
7867: contradictorily opposed to each other in the existence of one and the
7868: same thing. Now, how it is possible that out of a given state one quite
7869: opposite to it in the same thing should follow, reason without an
7870: example can not only not conceive, but cannot even make intelligible
7871: without intuition; and this intuition is the motion of a point in
7872: space; the existence of which in different spaces (as a consequence of
7873: opposite determinations) alone makes the intuition of change possible.
7874: For, in order to make even internal change cognitable, we require to
7875: represent time, as the form of the internal sense, figuratively by a
7876: line, and the internal change by the drawing of that line (motion), and
7877: consequently are obliged to employ external intuition to be able to
7878: represent the successive existence of ourselves in different states.
7879: The proper ground of this fact is that all change to be perceived as
7880: change presupposes something permanent in intuition, while in the
7881: internal sense no permanent intuition is to be found. Lastly, the
7882: objective possibility of the category of community cannot be conceived
7883: by mere reason, and consequently its objective reality cannot be
7884: demonstrated without an intuition, and that external in space. For how
7885: can we conceive the possibility of community, that is, when several
7886: substances exist, that some effect on the existence of the one follows
7887: from the existence of the other, and reciprocally, and therefore that,
7888: because something exists in the latter, something else must exist in
7889: the former, which could not be understood from its own existence alone?
7890: For this is the very essence of community—which is inconceivable as a
7891: property of things which are perfectly isolated. Hence, Leibnitz, in
7892: attributing to the substances of the world—as cogitated by the
7893: understanding alone—a community, required the mediating aid of a
7894: divinity; for, from their existence, such a property seemed to him with
7895: justice inconceivable. But we can very easily conceive the possibility
7896: of community (of substances as phenomena) if we represent them to
7897: ourselves as in space, consequently in external intuition. For external
7898: intuition contains in itself à priori formal external relations, as the
7899: conditions of the possibility of the real relations of action and
7900: reaction, and therefore of the possibility of community. With the same
7901: ease can it be demonstrated, that the possibility of things as
7902: quantities, and consequently the objective reality of the category of
7903: quantity, can be grounded only in external intuition, and that by its
7904: means alone is the notion of quantity appropriated by the internal
7905: sense. But I must avoid prolixity, and leave the task of illustrating
7906: this by examples to the reader’s own reflection.
7907: 
7908: The above remarks are of the greatest importance, not only for the
7909: confirmation of our previous confutation of idealism, but still more
7910: when the subject of self-cognition by mere internal consciousness and
7911: the determination of our own nature without the aid of external
7912: empirical intuitions is under discussion, for the indication of the
7913: grounds of the possibility of such a cognition.
7914: 
7915: The result of the whole of this part of the analytic of principles is,
7916: therefore: “All principles of the pure understanding are nothing more
7917: than à priori principles of the possibility of experience, and to
7918: experience alone do all à priori synthetical propositions apply and
7919: relate”; indeed, their possibility itself rests entirely on this
7920: relation.

7923: and Noumena
7924: 
7925: We have now not only traversed the region of the pure understanding and
7926: carefully surveyed every part of it, but we have also measured it, and
7927: assigned to everything therein its proper place. But this land is an
7928: island, and enclosed by nature herself within unchangeable limits. It
7929: is the land of truth (an attractive word), surrounded by a wide and
7930: stormy ocean, the region of illusion, where many a fog-bank, many an
7931: iceberg, seems to the mariner, on his voyage of discovery, a new
7932: country, and, while constantly deluding him with vain hopes, engages
7933: him in dangerous adventures, from which he never can desist, and which
7934: yet he never can bring to a termination. But before venturing upon this
7935: sea, in order to explore it in its whole extent, and to arrive at a
7936: certainty whether anything is to be discovered there, it will not be
7937: without advantage if we cast our eyes upon the chart of the land that
7938: we are about to leave, and to ask ourselves, firstly, whether we cannot
7939: rest perfectly contented with what it contains, or whether we must not
7940: of necessity be contented with it, if we can find nowhere else a solid
7941: foundation to build upon; and, secondly, by what title we possess this
7942: land itself, and how we hold it secure against all hostile claims?
7943: Although, in the course of our analytic, we have already given
7944: sufficient answers to these questions, yet a summary recapitulation of
7945: these solutions may be useful in strengthening our conviction, by
7946: uniting in one point the momenta of the arguments.
7947: 
7948: We have seen that everything which the understanding draws from itself,
7949: without borrowing from experience, it nevertheless possesses only for
7950: the behoof and use of experience. The principles of the pure
7951: understanding, whether constitutive à priori (as the mathematical
7952: principles), or merely regulative (as the dynamical), contain nothing
7953: but the pure schema, as it were, of possible experience. For experience
7954: possesses its unity from the synthetical unity which the understanding,
7955: originally and from itself, imparts to the synthesis of the imagination
7956: in relation to apperception, and in à priori relation to and agreement
7957: with which phenomena, as data for a possible cognition, must stand. But
7958: although these rules of the understanding are not only à priori true,
7959: but the very source of all truth, that is, of the accordance of our
7960: cognition with objects, and on this ground, that they contain the basis
7961: of the possibility of experience, as the ensemble of all cognition, it
7962: seems to us not enough to propound what is true—we desire also to be
7963: told what we want to know. If, then, we learn nothing more by this
7964: critical examination than what we should have practised in the merely
7965: empirical use of the understanding, without any such subtle inquiry,
7966: the presumption is that the advantage we reap from it is not worth the
7967: labour bestowed upon it. It may certainly be answered that no rash
7968: curiosity is more prejudicial to the enlargement of our knowledge than
7969: that which must know beforehand the utility of this or that piece of
7970: information which we seek, before we have entered on the needful
7971: investigations, and before one could form the least conception of its
7972: utility, even though it were placed before our eyes. But there is one
7973: advantage in such transcendental inquiries which can be made
7974: comprehensible to the dullest and most reluctant learner—this, namely,
7975: that the understanding which is occupied merely with empirical
7976: exercise, and does not reflect on the sources of its own cognition, may
7977: exercise its functions very well and very successfully, but is quite
7978: unable to do one thing, and that of very great importance, to
7979: determine, namely, the bounds that limit its employment, and to know
7980: what lies within or without its own sphere. This purpose can be
7981: obtained only by such profound investigations as we have instituted.
7982: But if it cannot distinguish whether certain questions lie within its
7983: horizon or not, it can never be sure either as to its claims or
7984: possessions, but must lay its account with many humiliating
7985: corrections, when it transgresses, as it unavoidably will, the limits
7986: of its own territory, and loses itself in fanciful opinions and
7987: blinding illusions.
7988: 
7989: That the understanding, therefore, cannot make of its à priori
7990: principles, or even of its conceptions, other than an empirical use, is
7991: a proposition which leads to the most important results. A
7992: transcendental use is made of a conception in a fundamental proposition
7993: or principle, when it is referred to things in general and considered
7994: as things in themselves; an empirical use, when it is referred merely
7995: to phenomena, that is, to objects of a possible experience. That the
7996: latter use of a conception is the only admissible one is evident from
7997: the reasons following. For every conception are requisite, firstly, the
7998: logical form of a conception (of thought) general; and, secondly, the
7999: possibility of presenting to this an object to which it may apply.
8000: Failing this latter, it has no sense, and utterly void of content,
8001: although it may contain the logical function for constructing a
8002: conception from certain data. Now, object cannot be given to a
8003: conception otherwise than by intuition, and, even if a pure intuition
8004: antecedent to the object is à priori possible, this pure intuition can
8005: itself obtain objective validity only from empirical intuition, of
8006: which it is itself but the form. All conceptions, therefore, and with
8007: them all principles, however high the degree of their à priori
8008: possibility, relate to empirical intuitions, that is, to data towards a
8009: possible experience. Without this they possess no objective validity,
8010: but are mere play of imagination or of understanding with images or
8011: notions. Let us take, for example, the conceptions of mathematics, and
8012: first in its pure intuitions. “Space has three dimensions”—“Between two
8013: points there can be only one straight line,” etc. Although all these
8014: principles, and the representation of the object with which this
8015: science occupies itself, are generated in the mind entirely à priori,
8016: they would nevertheless have no significance if we were not always able
8017: to exhibit their significance in and by means of phenomena (empirical
8018: objects). Hence it is requisite that an abstract conception be made
8019: sensuous, that is, that an object corresponding to it in intuition be
8020: forthcoming, otherwise the conception remains, as we say, without
8021: sense, that is, without meaning. Mathematics fulfils this requirement
8022: by the construction of the figure, which is a phenomenon evident to the
8023: senses. The same science finds support and significance in number; this
8024: in its turn finds it in the fingers, or in counters, or in lines and
8025: points. The conception itself is always produced à priori, together
8026: with the synthetical principles or formulas from such conceptions; but
8027: the proper employment of them, and their application to objects, can
8028: exist nowhere but in experience, the possibility of which, as regards
8029: its form, they contain à priori.
8030: 
8031: That this is also the case with all of the categories and the
8032: principles based upon them is evident from the fact that we cannot
8033: render intelligible the possibility of an object corresponding to them
8034: without having recourse to the conditions of sensibility, consequently,
8035: to the form of phenomena, to which, as their only proper objects, their
8036: use must therefore be confined, inasmuch as, if this condition is
8037: removed, all significance, that is, all relation to an object,
8038: disappears, and no example can be found to make it comprehensible what
8039: sort of things we ought to think under such conceptions.
8040: 
8041: The conception of quantity cannot be explained except by saying that it
8042: is the determination of a thing whereby it can be cogitated how many
8043: times one is placed in it. But this “how many times” is based upon
8044: successive repetition, consequently upon time and the synthesis of the
8045: homogeneous therein. Reality, in contradistinction to negation, can be
8046: explained only by cogitating a time which is either filled therewith or
8047: is void. If I leave out the notion of permanence (which is existence in
8048: all time), there remains in the conception of substance nothing but the
8049: logical notion of subject, a notion of which I endeavour to realize by
8050: representing to myself something that can exist only as a subject. But
8051: not only am I perfectly ignorant of any conditions under which this
8052: logical prerogative can belong to a thing, I can make nothing out of
8053: the notion, and draw no inference from it, because no object to which
8054: to apply the conception is determined, and we consequently do not know
8055: whether it has any meaning at all. In like manner, if I leave out the
8056: notion of time, in which something follows upon some other thing in
8057: conformity with a rule, I can find nothing in the pure category, except
8058: that there is a something of such a sort that from it a conclusion may
8059: be drawn as to the existence of some other thing. But in this case it
8060: would not only be impossible to distinguish between a cause and an
8061: effect, but, as this power to draw conclusions requires conditions of
8062: which I am quite ignorant, the conception is not determined as to the
8063: mode in which it ought to apply to an object. The so-called principle:
8064: “Everything that is contingent has a cause,” comes with a gravity and
8065: self-assumed authority that seems to require no support from without.
8066: But, I ask, what is meant by contingent? The answer is that the
8067: non-existence of which is possible. But I should like very well to know
8068: by what means this possibility of non-existence is to be cognized, if
8069: we do not represent to ourselves a succession in the series of
8070: phenomena, and in this succession an existence which follows a
8071: non-existence, or conversely, consequently, change. For to say, that
8072: the non-existence of a thing is not self-contradictory is a lame appeal
8073: to a logical condition, which is no doubt a necessary condition of the
8074: existence of the conception, but is far from being sufficient for the
8075: real objective possibility of non-existence. I can annihilate in
8076: thought every existing substance without self-contradiction, but I
8077: cannot infer from this their objective contingency in existence, that
8078: is to say, the possibility of their non-existence in itself. As regards
8079: the category of community, it may easily be inferred that, as the pure
8080: categories of substance and causality are incapable of a definition and
8081: explanation sufficient to determine their object without the aid of
8082: intuition, the category of reciprocal causality in the relation of
8083: substances to each other (commercium) is just as little susceptible
8084: thereof. Possibility, existence, and necessity nobody has ever yet been
8085: able to explain without being guilty of manifest tautology, when the
8086: definition has been drawn entirely from the pure understanding. For the
8087: substitution of the logical possibility of the conception—the condition
8088: of which is that it be not self-contradictory, for the transcendental
8089: possibility of things—the condition of which is that there be an object
8090: corresponding to the conception, is a trick which can only deceive the
8091: inexperienced.[38]
8092: 
8093:  [38] In one word, to none of these conceptions belongs a corresponding
8094:  object, and consequently their real possibility cannot be
8095:  demonstrated, if we take away sensuous intuition—the only intuition
8096:  which we possess—and there then remains nothing but the logical
8097:  possibility, that is, the fact that the conception or thought is
8098:  possible—which, however, is not the question; what we want to know
8099:  being, whether it relates to an object and thus possesses any meaning.
8100: 
8101: 
8102: It follows incontestably, that the pure conceptions of the
8103: understanding are incapable of transcendental, and must always be of
8104: empirical use alone, and that the principles of the pure understanding
8105: relate only to the general conditions of a possible experience, to
8106: objects of the senses, and never to things in general, apart from the
8107: mode in which we intuite them.
8108: 
8109: Transcendental analytic has accordingly this important result, to wit,
8110: that the understanding is competent effect nothing à priori, except the
8111: anticipation of the form of a possible experience in general, and that,
8112: as that which is not phenomenon cannot be an object of experience, it
8113: can never overstep the limits of sensibility, within which alone
8114: objects are presented to us. Its principles are merely principles of
8115: the exposition of phenomena, and the proud name of an ontology, which
8116: professes to present synthetical cognitions à priori of things in
8117: general in a systematic doctrine, must give place to the modest title
8118: of analytic of the pure understanding.
8119: 
8120: Thought is the act of referring a given intuition to an object. If the
8121: mode of this intuition is unknown to us, the object is merely
8122: transcendental, and the conception of the understanding is employed
8123: only transcendentally, that is, to produce unity in the thought of a
8124: manifold in general. Now a pure category, in which all conditions of
8125: sensuous intuition—as the only intuition we possess—are abstracted,
8126: does not determine an object, but merely expresses the thought of an
8127: object in general, according to different modes. Now, to employ a
8128: conception, the function of judgement is required, by which an object
8129: is subsumed under the conception, consequently the at least formal
8130: condition, under which something can be given in intuition. Failing
8131: this condition of judgement (schema), subsumption is impossible; for
8132: there is in such a case nothing given, which may be subsumed under the
8133: conception. The merely transcendental use of the categories is
8134: therefore, in fact, no use at all and has no determined, or even, as
8135: regards its form, determinable object. Hence it follows that the pure
8136: category is incompetent to establish a synthetical à priori principle,
8137: and that the principles of the pure understanding are only of empirical
8138: and never of transcendental use, and that beyond the sphere of possible
8139: experience no synthetical à priori principles are possible.
8140: 
8141: It may be advisable, therefore, to express ourselves thus. The pure
8142: categories, apart from the formal conditions of sensibility, have a
8143: merely transcendental meaning, but are nevertheless not of
8144: transcendental use, because this is in itself impossible, inasmuch as
8145: all the conditions of any employment or use of them (in judgements) are
8146: absent, to wit, the formal conditions of the subsumption of an object
8147: under these conceptions. As, therefore, in the character of pure
8148: categories, they must be employed empirically, and cannot be employed
8149: transcendentally, they are of no use at all, when separated from
8150: sensibility, that is, they cannot be applied to an object. They are
8151: merely the pure form of the employment of the understanding in respect
8152: of objects in general and of thought, without its being at the same
8153: time possible to think or to determine any object by their means. But
8154: there lurks at the foundation of this subject an illusion which it is
8155: very difficult to avoid. The categories are not based, as regards their
8156: origin, upon sensibility, like the forms of intuition, space, and time;
8157: they seem, therefore, to be capable of an application beyond the sphere
8158: of sensuous objects. But this is not the case. They are nothing but
8159: mere forms of thought, which contain only the logical faculty of
8160: uniting à priori in consciousness the manifold given in intuition.
8161: Apart, then, from the only intuition possible for us, they have still
8162: less meaning than the pure sensuous forms, space and time, for through
8163: them an object is at least given, while a mode of connection of the
8164: manifold, when the intuition which alone gives the manifold is wanting,
8165: has no meaning at all. At the same time, when we designate certain
8166: objects as phenomena or sensuous existences, thus distinguishing our
8167: mode of intuiting them from their own nature as things in themselves,
8168: it is evident that by this very distinction we as it were place the
8169: latter, considered in this their own nature, although we do not so
8170: intuite them, in opposition to the former, or, on the other hand, we do
8171: so place other possible things, which are not objects of our senses,
8172: but are cogitated by the understanding alone, and call them
8173: intelligible existences (noumena). Now the question arises whether the
8174: pure conceptions of our understanding do possess significance in
8175: respect of these latter, and may possibly be a mode of cognizing them.
8176: 
8177: But we are met at the very commencement with an ambiguity, which may
8178: easily occasion great misapprehension. The understanding, when it terms
8179: an object in a certain relation phenomenon, at the same time forms out
8180: of this relation a representation or notion of an object in itself, and
8181: hence believes that it can form also conceptions of such objects. Now
8182: as the understanding possesses no other fundamental conceptions besides
8183: the categories, it takes for granted that an object considered as a
8184: thing in itself must be capable of being thought by means of these pure
8185: conceptions, and is thereby led to hold the perfectly undetermined
8186: conception of an intelligible existence, a something out of the sphere
8187: of our sensibility, for a determinate conception of an existence which
8188: we can cognize in some way or other by means of the understanding.
8189: 
8190: If, by the term noumenon, we understand a thing so far as it is not an
8191: object of our sensuous intuition, thus making abstraction of our mode
8192: of intuiting it, this is a noumenon in the negative sense of the word.
8193: But if we understand by it an object of a non-sensuous intuition, we in
8194: this case assume a peculiar mode of intuition, an intellectual
8195: intuition, to wit, which does not, however, belong to us, of the very
8196: possibility of which we have no notion—and this is a noumenon in the
8197: positive sense.
8198: 
8199: The doctrine of sensibility is also the doctrine of noumena in the
8200: negative sense, that is, of things which the understanding is obliged
8201: to cogitate apart from any relation to our mode of intuition,
8202: consequently not as mere phenomena, but as things in themselves. But
8203: the understanding at the same time comprehends that it cannot employ
8204: its categories for the consideration of things in themselves, because
8205: these possess significance only in relation to the unity of intuitions
8206: in space and time, and that they are competent to determine this unity
8207: by means of general à priori connecting conceptions only on account of
8208: the pure ideality of space and time. Where this unity of time is not to
8209: be met with, as is the case with noumena, the whole use, indeed the
8210: whole meaning of the categories is entirely lost, for even the
8211: possibility of things to correspond to the categories is in this case
8212: incomprehensible. On this point, I need only refer the reader to what I
8213: have said at the commencement of the General Remark appended to the
8214: foregoing chapter. Now, the possibility of a thing can never be proved
8215: from the fact that the conception of it is not self-contradictory, but
8216: only by means of an intuition corresponding to the conception. If,
8217: therefore, we wish to apply the categories to objects which cannot be
8218: regarded as phenomena, we must have an intuition different from the
8219: sensuous, and in this case the objects would be a noumena in the
8220: positive sense of the word. Now, as such an intuition, that is, an
8221: intellectual intuition, is no part of our faculty of cognition, it is
8222: absolutely impossible for the categories to possess any application
8223: beyond the limits of experience. It may be true that there are
8224: intelligible existences to which our faculty of sensuous intuition has
8225: no relation, and cannot be applied, but our conceptions of the
8226: understanding, as mere forms of thought for our sensuous intuition, do
8227: not extend to these. What, therefore, we call noumenon must be
8228: understood by us as such in a negative sense.
8229: 
8230: If I take away from an empirical intuition all thought (by means of the
8231: categories), there remains no cognition of any object; for by means of
8232: mere intuition nothing is cogitated, and, from the existence of such or
8233: such an affection of sensibility in me, it does not follow that this
8234: affection or representation has any relation to an object without me.
8235: But if I take away all intuition, there still remains the form of
8236: thought, that is, the mode of determining an object for the manifold of
8237: a possible intuition. Thus the categories do in some measure really
8238: extend further than sensuous intuition, inasmuch as they think objects
8239: in general, without regard to the mode (of sensibility) in which these
8240: objects are given. But they do not for this reason apply to and
8241: determine a wider sphere of objects, because we cannot assume that such
8242: can be given, without presupposing the possibility of another than the
8243: sensuous mode of intuition, a supposition we are not justified in
8244: making.
8245: 
8246: I call a conception problematical which contains in itself no
8247: contradiction, and which is connected with other cognitions as a
8248: limitation of given conceptions, but whose objective reality cannot be
8249: cognized in any manner. The conception of a noumenon, that is, of a
8250: thing which must be cogitated not as an object of sense, but as a thing
8251: in itself (solely through the pure understanding), is not
8252: self-contradictory, for we are not entitled to maintain that
8253: sensibility is the only possible mode of intuition. Nay, further, this
8254: conception is necessary to restrain sensuous intuition within the
8255: bounds of phenomena, and thus to limit the objective validity of
8256: sensuous cognition; for things in themselves, which lie beyond its
8257: province, are called noumena for the very purpose of indicating that
8258: this cognition does not extend its application to all that the
8259: understanding thinks. But, after all, the possibility of such noumena
8260: is quite incomprehensible, and beyond the sphere of phenomena, all is
8261: for us a mere void; that is to say, we possess an understanding whose
8262: province does problematically extend beyond this sphere, but we do not
8263: possess an intuition, indeed, not even the conception of a possible
8264: intuition, by means of which objects beyond the region of sensibility
8265: could be given us, and in reference to which the understanding might be
8266: employed assertorically. The conception of a noumenon is therefore
8267: merely a limitative conception and therefore only of negative use. But
8268: it is not an arbitrary or fictitious notion, but is connected with the
8269: limitation of sensibility, without, however, being capable of
8270: presenting us with any positive datum beyond this sphere.
8271: 
8272: The division of objects into phenomena and noumena, and of the world
8273: into a mundus sensibilis and intelligibilis is therefore quite
8274: inadmissible in a positive sense, although conceptions do certainly
8275: admit of such a division; for the class of noumena have no determinate
8276: object corresponding to them, and cannot therefore possess objective
8277: validity. If we abandon the senses, how can it be made conceivable that
8278: the categories (which are the only conceptions that could serve as
8279: conceptions for noumena) have any sense or meaning at all, inasmuch as
8280: something more than the mere unity of thought, namely, a possible
8281: intuition, is requisite for their application to an object? The
8282: conception of a noumenon, considered as merely problematical, is,
8283: however, not only admissible, but, as a limitative conception of
8284: sensibility, absolutely necessary. But, in this case, a noumenon is not
8285: a particular intelligible object for our understanding; on the
8286: contrary, the kind of understanding to which it could belong is itself
8287: a problem, for we cannot form the most distant conception of the
8288: possibility of an understanding which should cognize an object, not
8289: discursively by means of categories, but intuitively in a non-sensuous
8290: intuition. Our understanding attains in this way a sort of negative
8291: extension. That is to say, it is not limited by, but rather limits,
8292: sensibility, by giving the name of noumena to things, not considered as
8293: phenomena, but as things in themselves. But it at the same time
8294: prescribes limits to itself, for it confesses itself unable to cognize
8295: these by means of the categories, and hence is compelled to cogitate
8296: them merely as an unknown something.
8297: 
8298: I find, however, in the writings of modern authors, an entirely
8299: different use of the expressions, mundus sensibilis and intelligibilis,
8300: which quite departs from the meaning of the ancients—an acceptation in
8301: which, indeed, there is to be found no difficulty, but which at the
8302: same time depends on mere verbal quibbling. According to this meaning,
8303: some have chosen to call the complex of phenomena, in so far as it is
8304: intuited, mundus sensibilis, but in so far as the connection thereof is
8305: cogitated according to general laws of thought, mundus intelligibilis.
8306: Astronomy, in so far as we mean by the word the mere observation of the
8307: starry heaven, may represent the former; a system of astronomy, such as
8308: the Copernican or Newtonian, the latter. But such twisting of words is
8309: a mere sophistical subterfuge, to avoid a difficult question, by
8310: modifying its meaning to suit our own convenience. To be sure,
8311: understanding and reason are employed in the cognition of phenomena;
8312: but the question is, whether these can be applied when the object is
8313: not a phenomenon and in this sense we regard it if it is cogitated as
8314: given to the understanding alone, and not to the senses. The question
8315: therefore is whether, over and above the empirical use of the
8316: understanding, a transcendental use is possible, which applies to the
8317: noumenon as an object. This question we have answered in the negative.
8318: 
8319: When therefore we say, the senses represent objects as they appear, the
8320: understanding as they are, the latter statement must not be understood
8321: in a transcendental, but only in an empirical signification, that is,
8322: as they must be represented in the complete connection of phenomena,
8323: and not according to what they may be, apart from their relation to
8324: possible experience, consequently not as objects of the pure
8325: understanding. For this must ever remain unknown to us. Nay, it is also
8326: quite unknown to us whether any such transcendental or extraordinary
8327: cognition is possible under any circumstances, at least, whether it is
8328: possible by means of our categories. Understanding and sensibility,
8329: with us, can determine objects only in conjunction. If we separate
8330: them, we have intuitions without conceptions, or conceptions without
8331: intuitions; in both cases, representations, which we cannot apply to
8332: any determinate object.
8333: 
8334: If, after all our inquiries and explanations, any one still hesitates
8335: to abandon the mere transcendental use of the categories, let him
8336: attempt to construct with them a synthetical proposition. It would, of
8337: course, be unnecessary for this purpose to construct an analytical
8338: proposition, for that does not extend the sphere of the understanding,
8339: but, being concerned only about what is cogitated in the conception
8340: itself, it leaves it quite undecided whether the conception has any
8341: relation to objects, or merely indicates the unity of thought—complete
8342: abstraction being made of the modi in which an object may be given: in
8343: such a proposition, it is sufficient for the understanding to know what
8344: lies in the conception—to what it applies is to it indifferent. The
8345: attempt must therefore be made with a synthetical and so-called
8346: transcendental principle, for example: “Everything that exists, exists
8347: as substance,” or, “Everything that is contingent exists as an effect
8348: of some other thing, viz., of its cause.” Now I ask, whence can the
8349: understanding draw these synthetical propositions, when the conceptions
8350: contained therein do not relate to possible experience but to things in
8351: themselves (noumena)? Where is to be found the third term, which is
8352: always requisite PURE site in a synthetical proposition, which may
8353: connect in the same proposition conceptions which have no logical
8354: (analytical) connection with each other? The proposition never will be
8355: demonstrated, nay, more, the possibility of any such pure assertion
8356: never can be shown, without making reference to the empirical use of
8357: the understanding, and thus, ipso facto, completely renouncing pure and
8358: non-sensuous judgement. Thus the conception of pure and merely
8359: intelligible objects is completely void of all principles of its
8360: application, because we cannot imagine any mode in which they might be
8361: given, and the problematical thought which leaves a place open for them
8362: serves only, like a void space, to limit the use of empirical
8363: principles, without containing at the same time any other object of
8364: cognition beyond their sphere.
8365: 
8366: APPENDIX
8367: 
8368: Of the Equivocal Nature or Amphiboly of the Conceptions of Reflection
8369: from the Confusion of the Transcendental with the Empirical use of the
8370: Understanding.
8371: 
8372: Reflection (reflexio) is not occupied about objects themselves, for the
8373: purpose of directly obtaining conceptions of them, but is that state of
8374: the mind in which we set ourselves to discover the subjective
8375: conditions under which we obtain conceptions. It is the consciousness
8376: of the relation of given representations to the different sources or
8377: faculties of cognition, by which alone their relation to each other can
8378: be rightly determined. The first question which occurs in considering
8379: our representations is to what faculty of cognition do they belong? To
8380: the understanding or to the senses? Many judgements are admitted to be
8381: true from mere habit or inclination; but, because reflection neither
8382: precedes nor follows, it is held to be a judgement that has its origin
8383: in the understanding. All judgements do not require examination, that
8384: is, investigation into the grounds of their truth. For, when they are
8385: immediately certain (for example: “Between two points there can be only
8386: one straight line”), no better or less mediate test of their truth can
8387: be found than that which they themselves contain and express. But all
8388: judgement, nay, all comparisons require reflection, that is, a
8389: distinction of the faculty of cognition to which the given conceptions
8390: belong. The act whereby I compare my representations with the faculty
8391: of cognition which originates them, and whereby I distinguish whether
8392: they are compared with each other as belonging to the pure
8393: understanding or to sensuous intuition, I term transcendental
8394: reflection. Now, the relations in which conceptions can stand to each
8395: other are those of identity and difference, agreement and opposition,
8396: of the internal and external, finally, of the determinable and the
8397: determining (matter and form). The proper determination of these
8398: relations rests on the question, to what faculty of cognition they
8399: subjectively belong, whether to sensibility or understanding? For, on
8400: the manner in which we solve this question depends the manner in which
8401: we must cogitate these relations.
8402: 
8403: Before constructing any objective judgement, we compare the conceptions
8404: that are to be placed in the judgement, and observe whether there
8405: exists identity (of many representations in one conception), if a
8406: general judgement is to be constructed, or difference, if a particular;
8407: whether there is agreement when affirmative; and opposition when
8408: negative judgements are to be constructed, and so on. For this reason
8409: we ought to call these conceptions, conceptions of comparison
8410: (conceptus comparationis). But as, when the question is not as to the
8411: logical form, but as to the content of conceptions, that is to say,
8412: whether the things themselves are identical or different, in agreement
8413: or opposition, and so on, the things can have a twofold relation to our
8414: faculty of cognition, to wit, a relation either to sensibility or to
8415: the understanding, and as on this relation depends their relation to
8416: each other, transcendental reflection, that is, the relation of given
8417: representations to one or the other faculty of cognition, can alone
8418: determine this latter relation. Thus we shall not be able to discover
8419: whether the things are identical or different, in agreement or
8420: opposition, etc., from the mere conception of the things by means of
8421: comparison (comparatio), but only by distinguishing the mode of
8422: cognition to which they belong, in other words, by means of
8423: transcendental reflection. We may, therefore, with justice say, that
8424: logical reflection is mere comparison, for in it no account is taken of
8425: the faculty of cognition to which the given conceptions belong, and
8426: they are consequently, as far as regards their origin, to be treated as
8427: homogeneous; while transcendental reflection (which applies to the
8428: objects themselves) contains the ground of the possibility of objective
8429: comparison of representations with each other, and is therefore very
8430: different from the former, because the faculties of cognition to which
8431: they belong are not even the same. Transcendental reflection is a duty
8432: which no one can neglect who wishes to establish an à priori judgement
8433: upon things. We shall now proceed to fulfil this duty, and thereby
8434: throw not a little light on the question as to the determination of the
8435: proper business of the understanding.
8436: 
8437: 1. Identity and Difference. When an object is presented to us several
8438: times, but always with the same internal determinations (qualitas et
8439: quantitas), it, if an object of pure understanding, is always the same,
8440: not several things, but only one thing (numerica identitas); but if a
8441: phenomenon, we do not concern ourselves with comparing the conception
8442: of the thing with the conception of some other, but, although they may
8443: be in this respect perfectly the same, the difference of place at the
8444: same time is a sufficient ground for asserting the numerical difference
8445: of these objects (of sense). Thus, in the case of two drops of water,
8446: we may make complete abstraction of all internal difference (quality
8447: and quantity), and, the fact that they are intuited at the same time in
8448: different places, is sufficient to justify us in holding them to be
8449: numerically different. Leibnitz regarded phenomena as things in
8450: themselves, consequently as intelligibilia, that is, objects of pure
8451: understanding (although, on account of the confused nature of their
8452: representations, he gave them the name of phenomena), and in this case
8453: his principle of the indiscernible (principium identatis
8454: indiscernibilium) is not to be impugned. But, as phenomena are objects
8455: of sensibility, and, as the understanding, in respect of them, must be
8456: employed empirically and not purely or transcendentally, plurality and
8457: numerical difference are given by space itself as the condition of
8458: external phenomena. For one part of space, although it may be perfectly
8459: similar and equal to another part, is still without it, and for this
8460: reason alone is different from the latter, which is added to it in
8461: order to make up a greater space. It follows that this must hold good
8462: of all things that are in the different parts of space at the same
8463: time, however similar and equal one may be to another.
8464: 
8465: 2. Agreement and Opposition. When reality is represented by the pure
8466: understanding (realitas noumenon), opposition between realities is
8467: incogitable—such a relation, that is, that when these realities are
8468: connected in one subject, they annihilate the effects of each other and
8469: may be represented in the formula 3 -3 = 0. On the other hand, the real
8470: in a phenomenon (realitas phaenomenon) may very well be in mutual
8471: opposition, and, when united in the same subject, the one may
8472: completely or in part annihilate the effect or consequence of the
8473: other; as in the case of two moving forces in the same straight line
8474: drawing or impelling a point in opposite directions, or in the case of
8475: a pleasure counterbalancing a certain amount of pain.
8476: 
8477: 3. The Internal and External. In an object of the pure understanding,
8478: only that is internal which has no relation (as regards its existence)
8479: to anything different from itself. On the other hand, the internal
8480: determinations of a substantia phaenomenon in space are nothing but
8481: relations, and it is itself nothing more than a complex of mere
8482: relations. Substance in space we are cognizant of only through forces
8483: operative in it, either drawing others towards itself (attraction), or
8484: preventing others from forcing into itself (repulsion and
8485: impenetrability). We know no other properties that make up the
8486: conception of substance phenomenal in space, and which we term matter.
8487: On the other hand, as an object of the pure understanding, every
8488: substance must have internal determination and forces. But what other
8489: internal attributes of such an object can I think than those which my
8490: internal sense presents to me? That, to wit, which in either itself
8491: thought, or something analogous to it. Hence Leibnitz, who looked upon
8492: things as noumena, after denying them everything like external
8493: relation, and therefore also composition or combination, declared that
8494: all substances, even the component parts of matter, were simple
8495: substances with powers of representation, in one word, monads.
8496: 
8497: 4. Matter and Form. These two conceptions lie at the foundation of all
8498: other reflection, so inseparably are they connected with every mode of
8499: exercising the understanding. The former denotes the determinable in
8500: general, the second its determination, both in a transcendental sense,
8501: abstraction being made of every difference in that which is given, and
8502: of the mode in which it is determined. Logicians formerly termed the
8503: universal, matter, the specific difference of this or that part of the
8504: universal, form. In a judgement one may call the given conceptions
8505: logical matter (for the judgement), the relation of these to each other
8506: (by means of the copula), the form of the judgement. In an object, the
8507: composite parts thereof (essentialia) are the matter; the mode in which
8508: they are connected in the object, the form. In respect to things in
8509: general, unlimited reality was regarded as the matter of all
8510: possibility, the limitation thereof (negation) as the form, by which
8511: one thing is distinguished from another according to transcendental
8512: conceptions. The understanding demands that something be given (at
8513: least in the conception), in order to be able to determine it in a
8514: certain manner. Hence, in a conception of the pure understanding, the
8515: matter precedes the form, and for this reason Leibnitz first assumed
8516: the existence of things (monads) and of an internal power of
8517: representation in them, in order to found upon this their external
8518: relation and the community their state (that is, of their
8519: representations). Hence, with him, space and time were possible—the
8520: former through the relation of substances, the latter through the
8521: connection of their determinations with each other, as causes and
8522: effects. And so would it really be, if the pure understanding were
8523: capable of an immediate application to objects, and if space and time
8524: were determinations of things in themselves. But being merely sensuous
8525: intuitions, in which we determine all objects solely as phenomena, the
8526: form of intuition (as a subjective property of sensibility) must
8527: antecede all matter (sensations), consequently space and time must
8528: antecede all phenomena and all data of experience, and rather make
8529: experience itself possible. But the intellectual philosopher could not
8530: endure that the form should precede the things themselves and determine
8531: their possibility; an objection perfectly correct, if we assume that we
8532: intuite things as they are, although with confused representation. But
8533: as sensuous intuition is a peculiar subjective condition, which is à
8534: priori at the foundation of all perception, and the form of which is
8535: primitive, the form must be given per se, and so far from matter (or
8536: the things themselves which appear) lying at the foundation of
8537: experience (as we must conclude, if we judge by mere conceptions), the
8538: very possibility of itself presupposes, on the contrary, a given formal
8539: intuition (space and time).
8540: 
8541: REMARK ON THE AMPHIBOLY OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF REFLECTION.
8542: 
8543: Let me be allowed to term the position which we assign to a conception
8544: either in the sensibility or in the pure understanding, the
8545: transcendental place. In this manner, the appointment of the position
8546: which must be taken by each conception according to the difference in
8547: its use, and the directions for determining this place to all
8548: conceptions according to rules, would be a transcendental topic, a
8549: doctrine which would thoroughly shield us from the surreptitious
8550: devices of the pure understanding and the delusions which thence arise,
8551: as it would always distinguish to what faculty of cognition each
8552: conception properly belonged. Every conception, every title, under
8553: which many cognitions rank together, may be called a logical place.
8554: Upon this is based the logical topic of Aristotle, of which teachers
8555: and rhetoricians could avail themselves, in order, under certain titles
8556: of thought, to observe what would best suit the matter they had to
8557: treat, and thus enable themselves to quibble and talk with fluency and
8558: an appearance of profundity.
8559: 
8560: Transcendental topic, on the contrary, contains nothing more than the
8561: above-mentioned four titles of all comparison and distinction, which
8562: differ from categories in this respect, that they do not represent the
8563: object according to that which constitutes its conception (quantity,
8564: reality), but set forth merely the comparison of representations, which
8565: precedes our conceptions of things. But this comparison requires a
8566: previous reflection, that is, a determination of the place to which the
8567: representations of the things which are compared belong, whether, to
8568: wit, they are cogitated by the pure understanding, or given by
8569: sensibility.
8570: 
8571: Conceptions may be logically compared without the trouble of inquiring
8572: to what faculty their objects belong, whether as noumena, to the
8573: understanding, or as phenomena, to sensibility. If, however, we wish to
8574: employ these conceptions in respect of objects, previous transcendental
8575: reflection is necessary. Without this reflection I should make a very
8576: unsafe use of these conceptions, and construct pretended synthetical
8577: propositions which critical reason cannot acknowledge and which are
8578: based solely upon a transcendental amphiboly, that is, upon a
8579: substitution of an object of pure understanding for a phenomenon.
8580: 
8581: For want of this doctrine of transcendental topic, and consequently
8582: deceived by the amphiboly of the conceptions of reflection, the
8583: celebrated Leibnitz constructed an intellectual system of the world, or
8584: rather, believed himself competent to cognize the internal nature of
8585: things, by comparing all objects merely with the understanding and the
8586: abstract formal conceptions of thought. Our table of the conceptions of
8587: reflection gives us the unexpected advantage of being able to exhibit
8588: the distinctive peculiarities of his system in all its parts, and at
8589: the same time of exposing the fundamental principle of this peculiar
8590: mode of thought, which rested upon naught but a misconception. He
8591: compared all things with each other merely by means of conceptions, and
8592: naturally found no other differences than those by which the
8593: understanding distinguishes its pure conceptions one from another. The
8594: conditions of sensuous intuition, which contain in themselves their own
8595: means of distinction, he did not look upon as primitive, because
8596: sensibility was to him but a confused mode of representation and not
8597: any particular source of representations. A phenomenon was for him the
8598: representation of the thing in itself, although distinguished from
8599: cognition by the understanding only in respect of the logical form—the
8600: former with its usual want of analysis containing, according to him, a
8601: certain mixture of collateral representations in its conception of a
8602: thing, which it is the duty of the understanding to separate and
8603: distinguish. In one word, Leibnitz intellectualized phenomena, just as
8604: Locke, in his system of noogony (if I may be allowed to make use of
8605: such expressions), sensualized the conceptions of the understanding,
8606: that is to say, declared them to be nothing more than empirical or
8607: abstract conceptions of reflection. Instead of seeking in the
8608: understanding and sensibility two different sources of representations,
8609: which, however, can present us with objective judgements of things only
8610: in conjunction, each of these great men recognized but one of these
8611: faculties, which, in their opinion, applied immediately to things in
8612: themselves, the other having no duty but that of confusing or arranging
8613: the representations of the former.
8614: 
8615: Accordingly, the objects of sense were compared by Leibnitz as things
8616: in general merely in the understanding.
8617: 
8618: 1st. He compares them in regard to their identity or difference—as
8619: judged by the understanding. As, therefore, he considered merely the
8620: conceptions of objects, and not their position in intuition, in which
8621: alone objects can be given, and left quite out of sight the
8622: transcendental locale of these conceptions—whether, that is, their
8623: object ought to be classed among phenomena, or among things in
8624: themselves, it was to be expected that he should extend the application
8625: of the principle of indiscernibles, which is valid solely of
8626: conceptions of things in general, to objects of sense (mundus
8627: phaenomenon), and that he should believe that he had thereby
8628: contributed in no small degree to extend our knowledge of nature. In
8629: truth, if I cognize in all its inner determinations a drop of water as
8630: a thing in itself, I cannot look upon one drop as different from
8631: another, if the conception of the one is completely identical with that
8632: of the other. But if it is a phenomenon in space, it has a place not
8633: merely in the understanding (among conceptions), but also in sensuous
8634: external intuition (in space), and in this case, the physical locale is
8635: a matter of indifference in regard to the internal determinations of
8636: things, and one place, B, may contain a thing which is perfectly
8637: similar and equal to another in a place, A, just as well as if the two
8638: things were in every respect different from each other. Difference of
8639: place without any other conditions, makes the plurality and distinction
8640: of objects as phenomena, not only possible in itself, but even
8641: necessary. Consequently, the above so-called law is not a law of
8642: nature. It is merely an analytical rule for the comparison of things by
8643: means of mere conceptions.
8644: 
8645: 2nd. The principle: “Realities (as simple affirmations) never logically
8646: contradict each other,” is a proposition perfectly true respecting the
8647: relation of conceptions, but, whether as regards nature, or things in
8648: themselves (of which we have not the slightest conception), is without
8649: any the least meaning. For real opposition, in which A -B is = 0,
8650: exists everywhere, an opposition, that is, in which one reality united
8651: with another in the same subject annihilates the effects of the other—a
8652: fact which is constantly brought before our eyes by the different
8653: antagonistic actions and operations in nature, which, nevertheless, as
8654: depending on real forces, must be called realitates phaenomena. General
8655: mechanics can even present us with the empirical condition of this
8656: opposition in an à priori rule, as it directs its attention to the
8657: opposition in the direction of forces—a condition of which the
8658: transcendental conception of reality can tell us nothing. Although M.
8659: Leibnitz did not announce this proposition with precisely the pomp of a
8660: new principle, he yet employed it for the establishment of new
8661: propositions, and his followers introduced it into their
8662: Leibnitzio-Wolfian system of philosophy. According to this principle,
8663: for example, all evils are but consequences of the limited nature of
8664: created beings, that is, negations, because these are the only opposite
8665: of reality. (In the mere conception of a thing in general this is
8666: really the case, but not in things as phenomena.) In like manner, the
8667: upholders of this system deem it not only possible, but natural also,
8668: to connect and unite all reality in one being, because they acknowledge
8669: no other sort of opposition than that of contradiction (by which the
8670: conception itself of a thing is annihilated), and find themselves
8671: unable to conceive an opposition of reciprocal destruction, so to
8672: speak, in which one real cause destroys the effect of another, and the
8673: conditions of whose representation we meet with only in sensibility.
8674: 
8675: 3rd. The Leibnitzian monadology has really no better foundation than on
8676: this philosopher’s mode of falsely representing the difference of the
8677: internal and external solely in relation to the understanding.
8678: Substances, in general, must have something inward, which is therefore
8679: free from external relations, consequently from that of composition
8680: also. The simple—that which can be represented by a unit—is therefore
8681: the foundation of that which is internal in things in themselves. The
8682: internal state of substances cannot therefore consist in place, shape,
8683: contact, or motion, determinations which are all external relations,
8684: and we can ascribe to them no other than that whereby we internally
8685: determine our faculty of sense itself, that is to say, the state of
8686: representation. Thus, then, were constructed the monads, which were to
8687: form the elements of the universe, the active force of which consists
8688: in representation, the effects of this force being thus entirely
8689: confined to themselves.
8690: 
8691: For the same reason, his view of the possible community of substances
8692: could not represent it but as a predetermined harmony, and by no means
8693: as a physical influence. For inasmuch as everything is occupied only
8694: internally, that is, with its own representations, the state of the
8695: representations of one substance could not stand in active and living
8696: connection with that of another, but some third cause operating on all
8697: without exception was necessary to make the different states correspond
8698: with one another. And this did not happen by means of assistance
8699: applied in each particular case (systema assistentiae), but through the
8700: unity of the idea of a cause occupied and connected with all
8701: substances, in which they necessarily receive, according to the
8702: Leibnitzian school, their existence and permanence, consequently also
8703: reciprocal correspondence, according to universal laws.
8704: 
8705: 4th. This philosopher’s celebrated doctrine of space and time, in which
8706: he intellectualized these forms of sensibility, originated in the same
8707: delusion of transcendental reflection. If I attempt to represent by the
8708: mere understanding, the external relations of things, I can do so only
8709: by employing the conception of their reciprocal action, and if I wish
8710: to connect one state of the same thing with another state, I must avail
8711: myself of the notion of the order of cause and effect. And thus
8712: Leibnitz regarded space as a certain order in the community of
8713: substances, and time as the dynamical sequence of their states. That
8714: which space and time possess proper to themselves and independent of
8715: things, he ascribed to a necessary confusion in our conceptions of
8716: them, whereby that which is a mere form of dynamical relations is held
8717: to be a self-existent intuition, antecedent even to things themselves.
8718: Thus space and time were the intelligible form of the connection of
8719: things (substances and their states) in themselves. But things were
8720: intelligible substances (substantiae noumena). At the same time, he
8721: made these conceptions valid of phenomena, because he did not allow to
8722: sensibility a peculiar mode of intuition, but sought all, even the
8723: empirical representation of objects, in the understanding, and left to
8724: sense naught but the despicable task of confusing and disarranging the
8725: representations of the former.
8726: 
8727: But even if we could frame any synthetical proposition concerning
8728: things in themselves by means of the pure understanding (which is
8729: impossible), it could not apply to phenomena, which do not represent
8730: things in themselves. In such a case I should be obliged in
8731: transcendental reflection to compare my conceptions only under the
8732: conditions of sensibility, and so space and time would not be
8733: determinations of things in themselves, but of phenomena. What things
8734: may be in themselves, I know not and need not know, because a thing is
8735: never presented to me otherwise than as a phenomenon.
8736: 
8737: I must adopt the same mode of procedure with the other conceptions of
8738: reflection. Matter is substantia phaenomenon. That in it which is
8739: internal I seek to discover in all parts of space which it occupies,
8740: and in all the functions and operations it performs, and which are
8741: indeed never anything but phenomena of the external sense. I cannot
8742: therefore find anything that is absolutely, but only what is
8743: comparatively internal, and which itself consists of external
8744: relations. The absolutely internal in matter, and as it should be
8745: according to the pure understanding, is a mere chimera, for matter is
8746: not an object for the pure understanding. But the transcendental
8747: object, which is the foundation of the phenomenon which we call matter,
8748: is a mere nescio quid, the nature of which we could not understand,
8749: even though someone were found able to tell us. For we can understand
8750: nothing that does not bring with it something in intuition
8751: corresponding to the expressions employed. If, by the complaint of
8752: being unable to perceive the internal nature of things, it is meant
8753: that we do not comprehend by the pure understanding what the things
8754: which appear to us may be in themselves, it is a silly and unreasonable
8755: complaint; for those who talk thus really desire that we should be able
8756: to cognize, consequently to intuite, things without senses, and
8757: therefore wish that we possessed a faculty of cognition perfectly
8758: different from the human faculty, not merely in degree, but even as
8759: regards intuition and the mode thereof, so that thus we should not be
8760: men, but belong to a class of beings, the possibility of whose
8761: existence, much less their nature and constitution, we have no means of
8762: cognizing. By observation and analysis of phenomena we penetrate into
8763: the interior of nature, and no one can say what progress this knowledge
8764: may make in time. But those transcendental questions which pass beyond
8765: the limits of nature, we could never answer, even although all nature
8766: were laid open to us, because we have not the power of observing our
8767: own mind with any other intuition than that of our internal sense. For
8768: herein lies the mystery of the origin and source of our faculty of
8769: sensibility. Its application to an object, and the transcendental
8770: ground of this unity of subjective and objective, lie too deeply
8771: concealed for us, who cognize ourselves only through the internal
8772: sense, consequently as phenomena, to be able to discover in our
8773: existence anything but phenomena, the non-sensuous cause of which we at
8774: the same time earnestly desire to penetrate to.
8775: 
8776: The great utility of this critique of conclusions arrived at by the
8777: processes of mere reflection consists in its clear demonstration of the
8778: nullity of all conclusions respecting objects which are compared with
8779: each other in the understanding alone, while it at the same time
8780: confirms what we particularly insisted on, namely, that, although
8781: phenomena are not included as things in themselves among the objects of
8782: the pure understanding, they are nevertheless the only things by which
8783: our cognition can possess objective reality, that is to say, which give
8784: us intuitions to correspond with our conceptions.
8785: 
8786: When we reflect in a purely logical manner, we do nothing more than
8787: compare conceptions in our understanding, to discover whether both have
8788: the same content, whether they are self-contradictory or not, whether
8789: anything is contained in either conception, which of the two is given,
8790: and which is merely a mode of thinking that given. But if I apply these
8791: conceptions to an object in general (in the transcendental sense),
8792: without first determining whether it is an object of sensuous or
8793: intellectual intuition, certain limitations present themselves, which
8794: forbid us to pass beyond the conceptions and render all empirical use
8795: of them impossible. And thus these limitations prove that the
8796: representation of an object as a thing in general is not only
8797: insufficient, but, without sensuous determination and independently of
8798: empirical conditions, self-contradictory; that we must therefore make
8799: abstraction of all objects, as in logic, or, admitting them, must think
8800: them under conditions of sensuous intuition; that, consequently, the
8801: intelligible requires an altogether peculiar intuition, which we do not
8802: possess, and in the absence of which it is for us nothing; while, on
8803: the other hand phenomena cannot be objects in themselves. For, when I
8804: merely think things in general, the difference in their external
8805: relations cannot constitute a difference in the things themselves; on
8806: the contrary, the former presupposes the latter, and if the conception
8807: of one of two things is not internally different from that of the
8808: other, I am merely thinking the same thing in different relations.
8809: Further, by the addition of one affirmation (reality) to the other, the
8810: positive therein is really augmented, and nothing is abstracted or
8811: withdrawn from it; hence the real in things cannot be in contradiction
8812: with or opposition to itself—and so on.
8813: 
8814: The true use of the conceptions of reflection in the employment of the
8815: understanding has, as we have shown, been so misconceived by Leibnitz,
8816: one of the most acute philosophers of either ancient or modern times,
8817: that he has been misled into the construction of a baseless system of
8818: intellectual cognition, which professes to determine its objects
8819: without the intervention of the senses. For this reason, the exposition
8820: of the cause of the amphiboly of these conceptions, as the origin of
8821: these false principles, is of great utility in determining with
8822: certainty the proper limits of the understanding.
8823: 
8824: It is right to say whatever is affirmed or denied of the whole of a
8825: conception can be affirmed or denied of any part of it (dictum de omni
8826: et nullo); but it would be absurd so to alter this logical proposition
8827: as to say whatever is not contained in a general conception is likewise
8828: not contained in the particular conceptions which rank under it; for
8829: the latter are particular conceptions, for the very reason that their
8830: content is greater than that which is cogitated in the general
8831: conception. And yet the whole intellectual system of Leibnitz is based
8832: upon this false principle, and with it must necessarily fall to the
8833: ground, together with all the ambiguous principles in reference to the
8834: employment of the understanding which have thence originated.
8835: 
8836: Leibnitz’s principle of the identity of indiscernibles or
8837: indistinguishables is really based on the presupposition that, if in
8838: the conception of a thing a certain distinction is not to be found, it
8839: is also not to be met with in things themselves; that, consequently,
8840: all things are completely identical (numero eadem) which are not
8841: distinguishable from each other (as to quality or quantity) in our
8842: conceptions of them. But, as in the mere conception of anything
8843: abstraction has been made of many necessary conditions of intuition,
8844: that of which abstraction has been made is rashly held to be
8845: non-existent, and nothing is attributed to the thing but what is
8846: contained in its conception.
8847: 
8848: The conception of a cubic foot of space, however I may think it, is in
8849: itself completely identical. But two cubic feet in space are
8850: nevertheless distinct from each other from the sole fact of their being
8851: in different places (they are numero diversa); and these places are
8852: conditions of intuition, wherein the object of this conception is
8853: given, and which do not belong to the conception, but to the faculty of
8854: sensibility. In like manner, there is in the conception of a thing no
8855: contradiction when a negative is not connected with an affirmative; and
8856: merely affirmative conceptions cannot, in conjunction, produce any
8857: negation. But in sensuous intuition, wherein reality (take for example,
8858: motion) is given, we find conditions (opposite directions)—of which
8859: abstraction has been made in the conception of motion in general—which
8860: render possible a contradiction or opposition (not indeed of a logical
8861: kind)—and which from pure positives produce zero = 0. We are therefore
8862: not justified in saying that all reality is in perfect agreement and
8863: harmony, because no contradiction is discoverable among its
8864: conceptions.[39] According to mere conceptions, that which is internal
8865: is the substratum of all relations or external determinations. When,
8866: therefore, I abstract all conditions of intuition, and confine myself
8867: solely to the conception of a thing in general, I can make abstraction
8868: of all external relations, and there must nevertheless remain a
8869: conception of that which indicates no relation, but merely internal
8870: determinations. Now it seems to follow that in everything (substance)
8871: there is something which is absolutely internal and which antecedes all
8872: external determinations, inasmuch as it renders them possible; and that
8873: therefore this substratum is something which does not contain any
8874: external relations and is consequently simple (for corporeal things are
8875: never anything but relations, at least of their parts external to each
8876: other); and, inasmuch as we know of no other absolutely internal
8877: determinations than those of the internal sense, this substratum is not
8878: only simple, but also, analogously with our internal sense, determined
8879: through representations, that is to say, all things are properly
8880: monads, or simple beings endowed with the power of representation. Now
8881: all this would be perfectly correct, if the conception of a thing were
8882: the only necessary condition of the presentation of objects of external
8883: intuition. It is, on the contrary, manifest that a permanent phenomenon
8884: in space (impenetrable extension) can contain mere relations, and
8885: nothing that is absolutely internal, and yet be the primary substratum
8886: of all external perception. By mere conceptions I cannot think anything
8887: external, without, at the same time, thinking something internal, for
8888: the reason that conceptions of relations presuppose given things, and
8889: without these are impossible. But, as an intuition there is something
8890: (that is, space, which, with all it contains, consists of purely
8891: formal, or, indeed, real relations) which is not found in the mere
8892: conception of a thing in general, and this presents to us the
8893: substratum which could not be cognized through conceptions alone, I
8894: cannot say: because a thing cannot be represented by mere conceptions
8895: without something absolutely internal, there is also, in the things
8896: themselves which are contained under these conceptions, and in their
8897: intuition nothing external to which something absolutely internal does
8898: not serve as the foundation. For, when we have made abstraction of all
8899: the conditions of intuition, there certainly remains in the mere
8900: conception nothing but the internal in general, through which alone the
8901: external is possible. But this necessity, which is grounded upon
8902: abstraction alone, does not obtain in the case of things themselves, in
8903: so far as they are given in intuition with such determinations as
8904: express mere relations, without having anything internal as their
8905: foundation; for they are not things of a thing of which we can neither
8906: for they are not things in themselves, but only phenomena. What we
8907: cognize in matter is nothing but relations (what we call its internal
8908: determinations are but comparatively internal). But there are some
8909: self-subsistent and permanent, through which a determined object is
8910: given. That I, when abstraction is made of these relations, have
8911: nothing more to think, does not destroy the conception of a thing as
8912: phenomenon, nor the conception of an object in abstracto, but it does
8913: away with the possibility of an object that is determinable according
8914: to mere conceptions, that is, of a noumenon. It is certainly startling
8915: to hear that a thing consists solely of relations; but this thing is
8916: simply a phenomenon, and cannot be cogitated by means of the mere
8917: categories: it does itself consist in the mere relation of something in
8918: general to the senses. In the same way, we cannot cogitate relations of
8919: things in abstracto, if we commence with conceptions alone, in any
8920: other manner than that one is the cause of determinations in the other;
8921: for that is itself the conception of the understanding or category of
8922: relation. But, as in this case we make abstraction of all intuition, we
8923: lose altogether the mode in which the manifold determines to each of
8924: its parts its place, that is, the form of sensibility (space); and yet
8925: this mode antecedes all empirical causality.
8926: 
8927:  [39] If any one wishes here to have recourse to the usual subterfuge,
8928:  and to say, that at least realitates noumena cannot be in opposition
8929:  to each other, it will be requisite for him to adduce an example of
8930:  this pure and non-sensuous reality, that it may be understood whether
8931:  the notion represents something or nothing. But an example cannot be
8932:  found except in experience, which never presents to us anything more
8933:  than phenomena; and thus the proposition means nothing more than that
8934:  the conception which contains only affirmatives does not contain
8935:  anything negative—a proposition nobody ever doubted.
8936: 
8937: 
8938: If by intelligible objects we understand things which can be thought by
8939: means of the pure categories, without the need of the schemata of
8940: sensibility, such objects are impossible. For the condition of the
8941: objective use of all our conceptions of understanding is the mode of
8942: our sensuous intuition, whereby objects are given; and, if we make
8943: abstraction of the latter, the former can have no relation to an
8944: object. And even if we should suppose a different kind of intuition
8945: from our own, still our functions of thought would have no use or
8946: signification in respect thereof. But if we understand by the term,
8947: objects of a non-sensuous intuition, in respect of which our categories
8948: are not valid, and of which we can accordingly have no knowledge
8949: (neither intuition nor conception), in this merely negative sense
8950: noumena must be admitted. For this is no more than saying that our mode
8951: of intuition is not applicable to all things, but only to objects of
8952: our senses, that consequently its objective validity is limited, and
8953: that room is therefore left for another kind of intuition, and thus
8954: also for things that may be objects of it. But in this sense the
8955: conception of a noumenon is problematical, that is to say, it is the
8956: notion of that it that it is possible, nor that it is impossible,
8957: inasmuch as we do not know of any mode of intuition besides the
8958: sensuous, or of any other sort of conceptions than the categories—a
8959: mode of intuition and a kind of conception neither of which is
8960: applicable to a non-sensuous object. We are on this account incompetent
8961: to extend the sphere of our objects of thought beyond the conditions of
8962: our sensibility, and to assume the existence of objects of pure
8963: thought, that is, of noumena, inasmuch as these have no true positive
8964: signification. For it must be confessed of the categories that they are
8965: not of themselves sufficient for the cognition of things in themselves
8966: and, without the data of sensibility, are mere subjective forms of the
8967: unity of the understanding. Thought is certainly not a product of the
8968: senses, and in so far is not limited by them, but it does not therefore
8969: follow that it may be employed purely and without the intervention of
8970: sensibility, for it would then be without reference to an object. And
8971: we cannot call a noumenon an object of pure thought; for the
8972: representation thereof is but the problematical conception of an object
8973: for a perfectly different intuition and a perfectly different
8974: understanding from ours, both of which are consequently themselves
8975: problematical. The conception of a noumenon is therefore not the
8976: conception of an object, but merely a problematical conception
8977: inseparably connected with the limitation of our sensibility. That is
8978: to say, this conception contains the answer to the question: “Are there
8979: objects quite unconnected with, and independent of, our intuition?”—a
8980: question to which only an indeterminate answer can be given. That
8981: answer is: “Inasmuch as sensuous intuition does not apply to all things
8982: without distinction, there remains room for other and different
8983: objects.” The existence of these problematical objects is therefore not
8984: absolutely denied, in the absence of a determinate conception of them,
8985: but, as no category is valid in respect of them, neither must they be
8986: admitted as objects for our understanding.
8987: 
8988: Understanding accordingly limits sensibility, without at the same time
8989: enlarging its own field. While, moreover, it forbids sensibility to
8990: apply its forms and modes to things in themselves and restricts it to
8991: the sphere of phenomena, it cogitates an object in itself, only,
8992: however, as a transcendental object, which is the cause of a phenomenon
8993: (consequently not itself a phenomenon), and which cannot be thought
8994: either as a quantity or as reality, or as substance (because these
8995: conceptions always require sensuous forms in which to determine an
8996: object)—an object, therefore, of which we are quite unable to say
8997: whether it can be met with in ourselves or out of us, whether it would
8998: be annihilated together with sensibility, or, if this were taken away,
8999: would continue to exist. If we wish to call this object a noumenon,
9000: because the representation of it is non-sensuous, we are at liberty to
9001: do so. But as we can apply to it none of the conceptions of our
9002: understanding, the representation is for us quite void, and is
9003: available only for the indication of the limits of our sensuous
9004: intuition, thereby leaving at the same time an empty space, which we
9005: are competent to fill by the aid neither of possible experience, nor of
9006: the pure understanding.
9007: 
9008: The critique of the pure understanding, accordingly, does not permit us
9009: to create for ourselves a new field of objects beyond those which are
9010: presented to us as phenomena, and to stray into intelligible worlds;
9011: nay, it does not even allow us to endeavour to form so much as a
9012: conception of them. The specious error which leads to this—and which is
9013: a perfectly excusable one—lies in the fact that the employment of the
9014: understanding, contrary to its proper purpose and destination, is made
9015: transcendental, and objects, that is, possible intuitions, are made to
9016: regulate themselves according to conceptions, instead of the
9017: conceptions arranging themselves according to the intuitions, on which
9018: alone their own objective validity rests. Now the reason of this again
9019: is that apperception, and with it thought, antecedes all possible
9020: determinate arrangement of representations. Accordingly we think
9021: something in general and determine it on the one hand sensuously, but,
9022: on the other, distinguish the general and in abstracto represented
9023: object from this particular mode of intuiting it. In this case there
9024: remains a mode of determining the object by mere thought, which is
9025: really but a logical form without content, which, however, seems to us
9026: to be a mode of the existence of the object in itself (noumenon),
9027: without regard to intuition which is limited to our senses.
9028: 
9029: Before ending this transcendental analytic, we must make an addition,
9030: which, although in itself of no particular importance, seems to be
9031: necessary to the completeness of the system. The highest conception,
9032: with which a transcendental philosophy commonly begins, is the division
9033: into possible and impossible. But as all division presupposes a divided
9034: conception, a still higher one must exist, and this is the conception
9035: of an object in general—problematically understood and without its
9036: being decided whether it is something or nothing. As the categories are
9037: the only conceptions which apply to objects in general, the
9038: distinguishing of an object, whether it is something or nothing, must
9039: proceed according to the order and direction of the categories.
9040: 
9041: 1. To the categories of quantity, that is, the conceptions of all,
9042: many, and one, the conception which annihilates all, that is, the
9043: conception of none, is opposed. And thus the object of a conception, to
9044: which no intuition can be found to correspond, is = nothing. That is,
9045: it is a conception without an object (ens rationis), like noumena,
9046: which cannot be considered possible in the sphere of reality, though
9047: they must not therefore be held to be impossible—or like certain new
9048: fundamental forces in matter, the existence of which is cogitable
9049: without contradiction, though, as examples from experience are not
9050: forthcoming, they must not be regarded as possible.
9051: 
9052: 2. Reality is something; negation is nothing, that is, a conception of
9053: the absence of an object, as cold, a shadow (nihil privativum).
9054: 
9055: 3. The mere form of intuition, without substance, is in itself no
9056: object, but the merely formal condition of an object (as phenomenon),
9057: as pure space and pure time. These are certainly something, as forms of
9058: intuition, but are not themselves objects which are intuited (ens
9059: imaginarium).
9060: 
9061: 4. The object of a conception which is self-contradictory, is nothing,
9062: because the conception is nothing—is impossible, as a figure composed
9063: of two straight lines (nihil negativum).
9064: 
9065: The table of this division of the conception of nothing (the
9066: corresponding division of the conception of something does not require
9067: special description) must therefore be arranged as follows:
9068: 
9069:                       NOTHING
9070:                         AS
9071: 
9072:                         1
9073:                 As Empty Conception
9074:                  without object,
9075:                   _ens rationis_
9076:            2                               3
9077:      Empty object of               Empty intuition
9078:       a conception,                without object,
9079:      _nihil privativum              ens imaginarium_
9080:                         4
9081:                    Empty object
9082:                  without conception,
9083:                   _nihil negativum_
9084: 
9085: We see that the ens rationis is distinguished from the nihil negativum
9086: or pure nothing by the consideration that the former must not be
9087: reckoned among possibilities, because it is a mere fiction—though not
9088: self-contradictory, while the latter is completely opposed to all
9089: possibility, inasmuch as the conception annihilates itself. Both,
9090: however, are empty conceptions. On the other hand, the nihil privativum
9091: and ens imaginarium are empty data for conceptions. If light be not
9092: given to the senses, we cannot represent to ourselves darkness, and if
9093: extended objects are not perceived, we cannot represent space. Neither
9094: the negation, nor the mere form of intuition can, without something
9095: real, be an object.
9096: 
9097: SECOND DIVISION—TRANSCENDENTAL LOGIC
9098: 
9099: TRANSCENDENTAL DIALECTIC.
9100: INTRODUCTION.
9101: 
9102: I. Of Transcendental Illusory Appearance
9103: 
9104: We termed dialectic in general a logic of appearance. This does not
9105: signify a doctrine of probability; for probability is truth, only
9106: cognized upon insufficient grounds, and though the information it gives
9107: us is imperfect, it is not therefore deceitful. Hence it must not be
9108: separated from the analytical part of logic. Still less must phenomenon
9109: and appearance be held to be identical. For truth or illusory
9110: appearance does not reside in the object, in so far as it is intuited,
9111: but in the judgement upon the object, in so far as it is thought. It
9112: is, therefore, quite correct to say that the senses do not err, not
9113: because they always judge correctly, but because they do not judge at
9114: all. Hence truth and error, consequently also, illusory appearance as
9115: the cause of error, are only to be found in a judgement, that is, in
9116: the relation of an object to our understanding. In a cognition which
9117: completely harmonizes with the laws of the understanding, no error can
9118: exist. In a representation of the senses—as not containing any
9119: judgement—there is also no error. But no power of nature can of itself
9120: deviate from its own laws. Hence neither the understanding per se
9121: (without the influence of another cause), nor the senses per se, would
9122: fall into error; the former could not, because, if it acts only
9123: according to its own laws, the effect (the judgement) must necessarily
9124: accord with these laws. But in accordance with the laws of the
9125: understanding consists the formal element in all truth. In the senses
9126: there is no judgement—neither a true nor a false one. But, as we have
9127: no source of cognition besides these two, it follows that error is
9128: caused solely by the unobserved influence of the sensibility upon the
9129: understanding. And thus it happens that the subjective grounds of a
9130: judgement and are confounded with the objective, and cause them to
9131: deviate from their proper determination,[40] just as a body in motion
9132: would always of itself proceed in a straight line, but if another
9133: impetus gives to it a different direction, it will then start off into
9134: a curvilinear line of motion. To distinguish the peculiar action of the
9135: understanding from the power which mingles with it, it is necessary to
9136: consider an erroneous judgement as the diagonal between two forces,
9137: that determine the judgement in two different directions, which, as it
9138: were, form an angle, and to resolve this composite operation into the
9139: simple ones of the understanding and the sensibility. In pure à priori
9140: judgements this must be done by means of transcendental reflection,
9141: whereby, as has been already shown, each representation has its place
9142: appointed in the corresponding faculty of cognition, and consequently
9143: the influence of the one faculty upon the other is made apparent.
9144: 
9145:  [40] Sensibility, subjected to the understanding, as the object upon
9146:  which the understanding employs its functions, is the source of real
9147:  cognitions. But, in so far as it exercises an influence upon the
9148:  action of the understanding and determines it to judgement,
9149:  sensibility is itself the cause of error.
9150: 
9151: 
9152: It is not at present our business to treat of empirical illusory
9153: appearance (for example, optical illusion), which occurs in the
9154: empirical application of otherwise correct rules of the understanding,
9155: and in which the judgement is misled by the influence of imagination.
9156: Our purpose is to speak of transcendental illusory appearance, which
9157: influences principles—that are not even applied to experience, for in
9158: this case we should possess a sure test of their correctness—but which
9159: leads us, in disregard of all the warnings of criticism, completely
9160: beyond the empirical employment of the categories and deludes us with
9161: the chimera of an extension of the sphere of the pure understanding. We
9162: shall term those principles the application of which is confined
9163: entirely within the limits of possible experience, immanent; those, on
9164: the other hand, which transgress these limits, we shall call
9165: transcendent principles. But by these latter I do not understand
9166: principles of the transcendental use or misuse of the categories, which
9167: is in reality a mere fault of the judgement when not under due
9168: restraint from criticism, and therefore not paying sufficient attention
9169: to the limits of the sphere in which the pure understanding is allowed
9170: to exercise its functions; but real principles which exhort us to break
9171: down all those barriers, and to lay claim to a perfectly new field of
9172: cognition, which recognizes no line of demarcation. Thus transcendental
9173: and transcendent are not identical terms. The principles of the pure
9174: understanding, which we have already propounded, ought to be of
9175: empirical and not of transcendental use, that is, they are not
9176: applicable to any object beyond the sphere of experience. A principle
9177: which removes these limits, nay, which authorizes us to overstep them,
9178: is called transcendent. If our criticism can succeed in exposing the
9179: illusion in these pretended principles, those which are limited in
9180: their employment to the sphere of experience may be called, in
9181: opposition to the others, immanent principles of the pure
9182: understanding.
9183: 
9184: Logical illusion, which consists merely in the imitation of the form of
9185: reason (the illusion in sophistical syllogisms), arises entirely from a
9186: want of due attention to logical rules. So soon as the attention is
9187: awakened to the case before us, this illusion totally disappears.
9188: Transcendental illusion, on the contrary, does not cease to exist, even
9189: after it has been exposed, and its nothingness clearly perceived by
9190: means of transcendental criticism. Take, for example, the illusion in
9191: the proposition: “The world must have a beginning in time.” The cause
9192: of this is as follows. In our reason, subjectively considered as a
9193: faculty of human cognition, there exist fundamental rules and maxims of
9194: its exercise, which have completely the appearance of objective
9195: principles. Now from this cause it happens that the subjective
9196: necessity of a certain connection of our conceptions, is regarded as an
9197: objective necessity of the determination of things in themselves. This
9198: illusion it is impossible to avoid, just as we cannot avoid perceiving
9199: that the sea appears to be higher at a distance than it is near the
9200: shore, because we see the former by means of higher rays than the
9201: latter, or, which is a still stronger case, as even the astronomer
9202: cannot prevent himself from seeing the moon larger at its rising than
9203: some time afterwards, although he is not deceived by this illusion.
9204: 
9205: Transcendental dialectic will therefore content itself with exposing
9206: the illusory appearance in transcendental judgements, and guarding us
9207: against it; but to make it, as in the case of logical illusion,
9208: entirely disappear and cease to be illusion is utterly beyond its
9209: power. For we have here to do with a natural and unavoidable illusion,
9210: which rests upon subjective principles and imposes these upon us as
9211: objective, while logical dialectic, in the detection of sophisms, has
9212: to do merely with an error in the logical consequence of the
9213: propositions, or with an artificially constructed illusion, in
9214: imitation of the natural error. There is, therefore, a natural and
9215: unavoidable dialectic of pure reason—not that in which the bungler,
9216: from want of the requisite knowledge, involves himself, nor that which
9217: the sophist devises for the purpose of misleading, but that which is an
9218: inseparable adjunct of human reason, and which, even after its
9219: illusions have been exposed, does not cease to deceive, and continually
9220: to lead reason into momentary errors, which it becomes necessary
9221: continually to remove.
9222: 
9223: II. Of Pure Reason as the Seat of Transcendental Illusory Appearance
9224: 
9225: A. OF REASON IN GENERAL.
9226: 
9227: All our knowledge begins with sense, proceeds thence to understanding,
9228: and ends with reason, beyond which nothing higher can be discovered in
9229: the human mind for elaborating the matter of intuition and subjecting
9230: it to the highest unity of thought. At this stage of our inquiry it is
9231: my duty to give an explanation of this, the highest faculty of
9232: cognition, and I confess I find myself here in some difficulty. Of
9233: reason, as of the understanding, there is a merely formal, that is,
9234: logical use, in which it makes abstraction of all content of cognition;
9235: but there is also a real use, inasmuch as it contains in itself the
9236: source of certain conceptions and principles, which it does not borrow
9237: either from the senses or the understanding. The former faculty has
9238: been long defined by logicians as the faculty of mediate conclusion in
9239: contradistinction to immediate conclusions (consequentiae immediatae);
9240: but the nature of the latter, which itself generates conceptions, is
9241: not to be understood from this definition. Now as a division of reason
9242: into a logical and a transcendental faculty presents itself here, it
9243: becomes necessary to seek for a higher conception of this source of
9244: cognition which shall comprehend both conceptions. In this we may
9245: expect, according to the analogy of the conceptions of the
9246: understanding, that the logical conception will give us the key to the
9247: transcendental, and that the table of the functions of the former will
9248: present us with the clue to the conceptions of reason.
9249: 
9250: In the former part of our transcendental logic, we defined the
9251: understanding to be the faculty of rules; reason may be distinguished
9252: from understanding as the faculty of principles.
9253: 
9254: The term principle is ambiguous, and commonly signifies merely a
9255: cognition that may be employed as a principle, although it is not in
9256: itself, and as regards its proper origin, entitled to the distinction.
9257: Every general proposition, even if derived from experience by the
9258: process of induction, may serve as the major in a syllogism; but it is
9259: not for that reason a principle. Mathematical axioms (for example,
9260: there can be only one straight line between two points) are general à
9261: priori cognitions, and are therefore rightly denominated principles,
9262: relatively to the cases which can be subsumed under them. But I cannot
9263: for this reason say that I cognize this property of a straight line
9264: from principles—I cognize it only in pure intuition.
9265: 
9266: Cognition from principles, then, is that cognition in which I cognize
9267: the particular in the general by means of conceptions. Thus every
9268: syllogism is a form of the deduction of a cognition from a principle.
9269: For the major always gives a conception, through which everything that
9270: is subsumed under the condition thereof is cognized according to a
9271: principle. Now as every general cognition may serve as the major in a
9272: syllogism, and the understanding presents us with such general à priori
9273: propositions, they may be termed principles, in respect of their
9274: possible use.
9275: 
9276: But if we consider these principles of the pure understanding in
9277: relation to their origin, we shall find them to be anything rather than
9278: cognitions from conceptions. For they would not even be possible à
9279: priori, if we could not rely on the assistance of pure intuition (in
9280: mathematics), or on that of the conditions of a possible experience.
9281: That everything that happens has a cause, cannot be concluded from the
9282: general conception of that which happens; on the contrary the principle
9283: of causality instructs us as to the mode of obtaining from that which
9284: happens a determinate empirical conception.
9285: 
9286: Synthetical cognitions from conceptions the understanding cannot
9287: supply, and they alone are entitled to be called principles. At the
9288: same time, all general propositions may be termed comparative
9289: principles.
9290: 
9291: It has been a long-cherished wish—that (who knows how late), may one
9292: day, be happily accomplished—that the principles of the endless variety
9293: of civil laws should be investigated and exposed; for in this way alone
9294: can we find the secret of simplifying legislation. But in this case,
9295: laws are nothing more than limitations of our freedom upon conditions
9296: under which it subsists in perfect harmony with itself; they
9297: consequently have for their object that which is completely our own
9298: work, and of which we ourselves may be the cause by means of these
9299: conceptions. But how objects as things in themselves—how the nature of
9300: things is subordinated to principles and is to be determined, according
9301: to conceptions, is a question which it seems well nigh impossible to
9302: answer. Be this, however, as it may—for on this point our investigation
9303: is yet to be made—it is at least manifest from what we have said that
9304: cognition from principles is something very different from cognition by
9305: means of the understanding, which may indeed precede other cognitions
9306: in the form of a principle, but in itself—in so far as it is
9307: synthetical—is neither based upon mere thought, nor contains a general
9308: proposition drawn from conceptions alone.
9309: 
9310: The understanding may be a faculty for the production of unity of
9311: phenomena by virtue of rules; the reason is a faculty for the
9312: production of unity of rules (of the understanding) under principles.
9313: Reason, therefore, never applies directly to experience, or to any
9314: sensuous object; its object is, on the contrary, the understanding, to
9315: the manifold cognition of which it gives a unity à priori by means of
9316: conceptions—a unity which may be called rational unity, and which is of
9317: a nature very different from that of the unity produced by the
9318: understanding.
9319: 
9320: The above is the general conception of the faculty of reason, in so far
9321: as it has been possible to make it comprehensible in the absence of
9322: examples. These will be given in the sequel.
9323: 
9324: B. OF THE LOGICAL USE OF REASON.
9325: 
9326: A distinction is commonly made between that which is immediately
9327: cognized and that which is inferred or concluded. That in a figure
9328: which is bounded by three straight lines there are three angles, is an
9329: immediate cognition; but that these angles are together equal to two
9330: right angles, is an inference or conclusion. Now, as we are constantly
9331: employing this mode of thought and have thus become quite accustomed to
9332: it, we no longer remark the above distinction, and, as in the case of
9333: the so-called deceptions of sense, consider as immediately perceived,
9334: what has really been inferred. In every reasoning or syllogism, there
9335: is a fundamental proposition, afterwards a second drawn from it, and
9336: finally the conclusion, which connects the truth in the first with the
9337: truth in the second—and that infallibly. If the judgement concluded is
9338: so contained in the first proposition that it can be deduced from it
9339: without the meditation of a third notion, the conclusion is called
9340: immediate (consequentia immediata); I prefer the term conclusion of the
9341: understanding. But if, in addition to the fundamental cognition, a
9342: second judgement is necessary for the production of the conclusion, it
9343: is called a conclusion of the reason. In the proposition: All men are
9344: mortal, are contained the propositions: Some men are mortal, Nothing
9345: that is not mortal is a man, and these are therefore immediate
9346: conclusions from the first. On the other hand, the proposition: all the
9347: learned are mortal, is not contained in the main proposition (for the
9348: conception of a learned man does not occur in it), and it can be
9349: deduced from the main proposition only by means of a mediating
9350: judgement.
9351: 
9352: In every syllogism I first cogitate a rule (the major) by means of the
9353: understanding. In the next place I subsume a cognition under the
9354: condition of the rule (and this is the minor) by means of the
9355: judgement. And finally I determine my cognition by means of the
9356: predicate of the rule (this is the conclusio), consequently, I
9357: determine it à priori by means of the reason. The relations, therefore,
9358: which the major proposition, as the rule, represents between a
9359: cognition and its condition, constitute the different kinds of
9360: syllogisms. These are just threefold—analogously with all judgements,
9361: in so far as they differ in the mode of expressing the relation of a
9362: cognition in the understanding—namely, categorical, hypothetical, and
9363: disjunctive.
9364: 
9365: When as often happens, the conclusion is a judgement which may follow
9366: from other given judgements, through which a perfectly different object
9367: is cogitated, I endeavour to discover in the understanding whether the
9368: assertion in this conclusion does not stand under certain conditions
9369: according to a general rule. If I find such a condition, and if the
9370: object mentioned in the conclusion can be subsumed under the given
9371: condition, then this conclusion follows from a rule which is also valid
9372: for other objects of cognition. From this we see that reason endeavours
9373: to subject the great variety of the cognitions of the understanding to
9374: the smallest possible number of principles (general conditions), and
9375: thus to produce in it the highest unity.
9376: 
9377: C. OF THE PURE USE OF REASON.
9378: 
9379: Can we isolate reason, and, if so, is it in this case a peculiar source
9380: of conceptions and judgements which spring from it alone, and through
9381: which it can be applied to objects; or is it merely a subordinate
9382: faculty, whose duty it is to give a certain form to given cognitions—a
9383: form which is called logical, and through which the cognitions of the
9384: understanding are subordinated to each other, and lower rules to higher
9385: (those, to wit, whose condition comprises in its sphere the condition
9386: of the others), in so far as this can be done by comparison? This is
9387: the question which we have at present to answer. Manifold variety of
9388: rules and unity of principles is a requirement of reason, for the
9389: purpose of bringing the understanding into complete accordance with
9390: itself, just as understanding subjects the manifold content of
9391: intuition to conceptions, and thereby introduces connection into it.
9392: But this principle prescribes no law to objects, and does not contain
9393: any ground of the possibility of cognizing or of determining them as
9394: such, but is merely a subjective law for the proper arrangement of the
9395: content of the understanding. The purpose of this law is, by a
9396: comparison of the conceptions of the understanding, to reduce them to
9397: the smallest possible number, although, at the same time, it does not
9398: justify us in demanding from objects themselves such a uniformity as
9399: might contribute to the convenience and the enlargement of the sphere
9400: of the understanding, or in expecting that it will itself thus receive
9401: from them objective validity. In one word, the question is: “does
9402: reason in itself, that is, does pure reason contain à priori
9403: synthetical principles and rules, and what are those principles?”
9404: 
9405: The formal and logical procedure of reason in syllogisms gives us
9406: sufficient information in regard to the ground on which the
9407: transcendental principle of reason in its pure synthetical cognition
9408: will rest.
9409: 
9410: 1. Reason, as observed in the syllogistic process, is not applicable to
9411: intuitions, for the purpose of subjecting them to rules—for this is the
9412: province of the understanding with its categories—but to conceptions
9413: and judgements. If pure reason does apply to objects and the intuition
9414: of them, it does so not immediately, but mediately—through the
9415: understanding and its judgements, which have a direct relation to the
9416: senses and their intuition, for the purpose of determining their
9417: objects. The unity of reason is therefore not the unity of a possible
9418: experience, but is essentially different from this unity, which is that
9419: of the understanding. That everything which happens has a cause, is not
9420: a principle cognized and prescribed by reason. This principle makes the
9421: unity of experience possible and borrows nothing from reason, which,
9422: without a reference to possible experience, could never have produced
9423: by means of mere conceptions any such synthetical unity.
9424: 
9425: 2. Reason, in its logical use, endeavours to discover the general
9426: condition of its judgement (the conclusion), and a syllogism is itself
9427: nothing but a judgement by means of the subsumption of its condition
9428: under a general rule (the major). Now as this rule may itself be
9429: subjected to the same process of reason, and thus the condition of the
9430: condition be sought (by means of a prosyllogism) as long as the process
9431: can be continued, it is very manifest that the peculiar principle of
9432: reason in its logical use is to find for the conditioned cognition of
9433: the understanding the unconditioned whereby the unity of the former is
9434: completed.
9435: 
9436: But this logical maxim cannot be a principle of pure reason, unless we
9437: admit that, if the conditioned is given, the whole series of conditions
9438: subordinated to one another—a series which is consequently itself
9439: unconditioned—is also given, that is, contained in the object and its
9440: connection.
9441: 
9442: But this principle of pure reason is evidently synthetical; for,
9443: analytically, the conditioned certainly relates to some condition, but
9444: not to the unconditioned. From this principle also there must originate
9445: different synthetical propositions, of which the pure understanding is
9446: perfectly ignorant, for it has to do only with objects of a possible
9447: experience, the cognition and synthesis of which is always conditioned.
9448: The unconditioned, if it does really exist, must be especially
9449: considered in regard to the determinations which distinguish it from
9450: whatever is conditioned, and will thus afford us material for many à
9451: priori synthetical propositions.
9452: 
9453: The principles resulting from this highest principle of pure reason
9454: will, however, be transcendent in relation to phenomena, that is to
9455: say, it will be impossible to make any adequate empirical use of this
9456: principle. It is therefore completely different from all principles of
9457: the understanding, the use made of which is entirely immanent, their
9458: object and purpose being merely the possibility of experience. Now our
9459: duty in the transcendental dialectic is as follows. To discover whether
9460: the principle that the series of conditions (in the synthesis of
9461: phenomena, or of thought in general) extends to the unconditioned is
9462: objectively true, or not; what consequences result therefrom affecting
9463: the empirical use of the understanding, or rather whether there exists
9464: any such objectively valid proposition of reason, and whether it is
9465: not, on the contrary, a merely logical precept which directs us to
9466: ascend perpetually to still higher conditions, to approach completeness
9467: in the series of them, and thus to introduce into our cognition the
9468: highest possible unity of reason. We must ascertain, I say, whether
9469: this requirement of reason has not been regarded, by a
9470: misunderstanding, as a transcendental principle of pure reason, which
9471: postulates a thorough completeness in the series of conditions in
9472: objects themselves. We must show, moreover, the misconceptions and
9473: illusions that intrude into syllogisms, the major proposition of which
9474: pure reason has supplied—a proposition which has perhaps more of the
9475: character of a petitio than of a postulatum—and that proceed from
9476: experience upwards to its conditions. The solution of these problems is
9477: our task in transcendental dialectic, which we are about to expose even
9478: at its source, that lies deep in human reason. We shall divide it into
9479: two parts, the first of which will treat of the transcendent
9480: conceptions of pure reason, the second of transcendent and dialectical
9481: syllogisms.
9482: 
9483: TRANSCENDENTAL DIALECTIC—BOOK I—OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF PURE REASON.
9484: 
9485: The conceptions of pure reason—we do not here speak of the possibility
9486: of them—are not obtained by reflection, but by inference or conclusion.
9487: The conceptions of understanding are also cogitated à priori
9488: antecedently to experience, and render it possible; but they contain
9489: nothing but the unity of reflection upon phenomena, in so far as these
9490: must necessarily belong to a possible empirical consciousness. Through
9491: them alone are cognition and the determination of an object possible.
9492: It is from them, accordingly, that we receive material for reasoning,
9493: and antecedently to them we possess no à priori conceptions of objects
9494: from which they might be deduced, On the other hand, the sole basis of
9495: their objective reality consists in the necessity imposed on them, as
9496: containing the intellectual form of all experience, of restricting
9497: their application and influence to the sphere of experience.
9498: 
9499: But the term, conception of reason, or rational conception, itself
9500: indicates that it does not confine itself within the limits of
9501: experience, because its object-matter is a cognition, of which every
9502: empirical cognition is but a part—nay, the whole of possible experience
9503: may be itself but a part of it—a cognition to which no actual
9504: experience ever fully attains, although it does always pertain to it.
9505: The aim of rational conceptions is the comprehension, as that of the
9506: conceptions of understanding is the understanding of perceptions. If
9507: they contain the unconditioned, they relate to that to which all
9508: experience is subordinate, but which is never itself an object of
9509: experience—that towards which reason tends in all its conclusions from
9510: experience, and by the standard of which it estimates the degree of
9511: their empirical use, but which is never itself an element in an
9512: empirical synthesis. If, notwithstanding, such conceptions possess
9513: objective validity, they may be called conceptus ratiocinati
9514: (conceptions legitimately concluded); in cases where they do not, they
9515: have been admitted on account of having the appearance of being
9516: correctly concluded, and may be called conceptus ratiocinantes
9517: (sophistical conceptions). But as this can only be sufficiently
9518: demonstrated in that part of our treatise which relates to the
9519: dialectical conclusions of reason, we shall omit any consideration of
9520: it in this place. As we called the pure conceptions of the
9521: understanding categories, we shall also distinguish those of pure
9522: reason by a new name and call them transcendental ideas. These terms,
9523: however, we must in the first place explain and justify.
9524: 
9525: Section I—Of Ideas in General
9526: 
9527: Despite the great wealth of words which European languages possess, the
9528: thinker finds himself often at a loss for an expression exactly suited
9529: to his conception, for want of which he is unable to make himself
9530: intelligible either to others or to himself. To coin new words is a
9531: pretension to legislation in language which is seldom successful; and,
9532: before recourse is taken to so desperate an expedient, it is advisable
9533: to examine the dead and learned languages, with the hope and the
9534: probability that we may there meet with some adequate expression of the
9535: notion we have in our minds. In this case, even if the original meaning
9536: of the word has become somewhat uncertain, from carelessness or want of
9537: caution on the part of the authors of it, it is always better to adhere
9538: to and confirm its proper meaning—even although it may be doubtful
9539: whether it was formerly used in exactly this sense—than to make our
9540: labour vain by want of sufficient care to render ourselves
9541: intelligible.
9542: 
9543: For this reason, when it happens that there exists only a single word
9544: to express a certain conception, and this word, in its usual
9545: acceptation, is thoroughly adequate to the conception, the accurate
9546: distinction of which from related conceptions is of great importance,
9547: we ought not to employ the expression improvidently, or, for the sake
9548: of variety and elegance of style, use it as a synonym for other cognate
9549: words. It is our duty, on the contrary, carefully to preserve its
9550: peculiar signification, as otherwise it easily happens that when the
9551: attention of the reader is no longer particularly attracted to the
9552: expression, and it is lost amid the multitude of other words of very
9553: different import, the thought which it conveyed, and which it alone
9554: conveyed, is lost with it.
9555: 
9556: Plato employed the expression idea in a way that plainly showed he
9557: meant by it something which is never derived from the senses, but which
9558: far transcends even the conceptions of the understanding (with which
9559: Aristotle occupied himself), inasmuch as in experience nothing
9560: perfectly corresponding to them could be found. Ideas are, according to
9561: him, archetypes of things themselves, and not merely keys to possible
9562: experiences, like the categories. In his view they flow from the
9563: highest reason, by which they have been imparted to human reason,
9564: which, however, exists no longer in its original state, but is obliged
9565: with great labour to recall by reminiscence—which is called
9566: philosophy—the old but now sadly obscured ideas. I will not here enter
9567: upon any literary investigation of the sense which this sublime
9568: philosopher attached to this expression. I shall content myself with
9569: remarking that it is nothing unusual, in common conversation as well as
9570: in written works, by comparing the thoughts which an author has
9571: delivered upon a subject, to understand him better than he understood
9572: himself inasmuch as he may not have sufficiently determined his
9573: conception, and thus have sometimes spoken, nay even thought, in
9574: opposition to his own opinions.
9575: 
9576: Plato perceived very clearly that our faculty of cognition has the
9577: feeling of a much higher vocation than that of merely spelling out
9578: phenomena according to synthetical unity, for the purpose of being able
9579: to read them as experience, and that our reason naturally raises itself
9580: to cognitions far too elevated to admit of the possibility of an object
9581: given by experience corresponding to them—cognitions which are
9582: nevertheless real, and are not mere phantoms of the brain.
9583: 
9584: This philosopher found his ideas especially in all that is
9585: practical,[41] that is, which rests upon freedom, which in its turn
9586: ranks under cognitions that are the peculiar product of reason. He who
9587: would derive from experience the conceptions of virtue, who would make
9588: (as many have really done) that, which at best can but serve as an
9589: imperfectly illustrative example, a model for or the formation of a
9590: perfectly adequate idea on the subject, would in fact transform virtue
9591: into a nonentity changeable according to time and circumstance and
9592: utterly incapable of being employed as a rule. On the contrary, every
9593: one is conscious that, when any one is held up to him as a model of
9594: virtue, he compares this so-called model with the true original which
9595: he possesses in his own mind and values him according to this standard.
9596: But this standard is the idea of virtue, in relation to which all
9597: possible objects of experience are indeed serviceable as
9598: examples—proofs of the practicability in a certain degree of that which
9599: the conception of virtue demands—but certainly not as archetypes. That
9600: the actions of man will never be in perfect accordance with all the
9601: requirements of the pure ideas of reason, does not prove the thought to
9602: be chimerical. For only through this idea are all judgements as to
9603: moral merit or demerit possible; it consequently lies at the foundation
9604: of every approach to moral perfection, however far removed from it the
9605: obstacles in human nature—indeterminable as to degree—may keep us.
9606: 
9607:  [41] He certainly extended the application of his conception to
9608:  speculative cognitions also, provided they were given pure and
9609:  completely à priori, nay, even to mathematics, although this science
9610:  cannot possess an object otherwhere than in Possible experience. I
9611:  cannot follow him in this, and as little can I follow him in his
9612:  mystical deduction of these ideas, or in his hypostatization of them;
9613:  although, in truth, the elevated and exaggerated language which he
9614:  employed in describing them is quite capable of an interpretation more
9615:  subdued and more in accordance with fact and the nature of things.
9616: 
9617: 
9618: The Platonic Republic has become proverbial as an example—and a
9619: striking one—of imaginary perfection, such as can exist only in the
9620: brain of the idle thinker; and Brucker ridicules the philosopher for
9621: maintaining that a prince can never govern well, unless he is
9622: participant in the ideas. But we should do better to follow up this
9623: thought and, where this admirable thinker leaves us without assistance,
9624: employ new efforts to place it in clearer light, rather than carelessly
9625: fling it aside as useless, under the very miserable and pernicious
9626: pretext of impracticability. A constitution of the greatest possible
9627: human freedom according to laws, by which the liberty of every
9628: individual can consist with the liberty of every other (not of the
9629: greatest possible happiness, for this follows necessarily from the
9630: former), is, to say the least, a necessary idea, which must be placed
9631: at the foundation not only of the first plan of the constitution of a
9632: state, but of all its laws. And, in this, it not necessary at the
9633: outset to take account of the obstacles which lie in our way—obstacles
9634: which perhaps do not necessarily arise from the character of human
9635: nature, but rather from the previous neglect of true ideas in
9636: legislation. For there is nothing more pernicious and more unworthy of
9637: a philosopher, than the vulgar appeal to a so-called adverse
9638: experience, which indeed would not have existed, if those institutions
9639: had been established at the proper time and in accordance with ideas;
9640: while, instead of this, conceptions, crude for the very reason that
9641: they have been drawn from experience, have marred and frustrated all
9642: our better views and intentions. The more legislation and government
9643: are in harmony with this idea, the more rare do punishments become and
9644: thus it is quite reasonable to maintain, as Plato did, that in a
9645: perfect state no punishments at all would be necessary. Now although a
9646: perfect state may never exist, the idea is not on that account the less
9647: just, which holds up this maximum as the archetype or standard of a
9648: constitution, in order to bring legislative government always nearer
9649: and nearer to the greatest possible perfection. For at what precise
9650: degree human nature must stop in its progress, and how wide must be the
9651: chasm which must necessarily exist between the idea and its
9652: realization, are problems which no one can or ought to determine—and
9653: for this reason, that it is the destination of freedom to overstep all
9654: assigned limits between itself and the idea.
9655: 
9656: But not only in that wherein human reason is a real causal agent and
9657: where ideas are operative causes (of actions and their objects), that
9658: is to say, in the region of ethics, but also in regard to nature
9659: herself, Plato saw clear proofs of an origin from ideas. A plant, and
9660: animal, the regular order of nature—probably also the disposition of
9661: the whole universe—give manifest evidence that they are possible only
9662: by means of and according to ideas; that, indeed, no one creature,
9663: under the individual conditions of its existence, perfectly harmonizes
9664: with the idea of the most perfect of its kind—just as little as man
9665: with the idea of humanity, which nevertheless he bears in his soul as
9666: the archetypal standard of his actions; that, notwithstanding, these
9667: ideas are in the highest sense individually, unchangeably, and
9668: completely determined, and are the original causes of things; and that
9669: the totality of connected objects in the universe is alone fully
9670: adequate to that idea. Setting aside the exaggerations of expression in
9671: the writings of this philosopher, the mental power exhibited in this
9672: ascent from the ectypal mode of regarding the physical world to the
9673: architectonic connection thereof according to ends, that is, ideas, is
9674: an effort which deserves imitation and claims respect. But as regards
9675: the principles of ethics, of legislation, and of religion, spheres in
9676: which ideas alone render experience possible, although they never
9677: attain to full expression therein, he has vindicated for himself a
9678: position of peculiar merit, which is not appreciated only because it is
9679: judged by the very empirical rules, the validity of which as principles
9680: is destroyed by ideas. For as regards nature, experience presents us
9681: with rules and is the source of truth, but in relation to ethical laws
9682: experience is the parent of illusion, and it is in the highest degree
9683: reprehensible to limit or to deduce the laws which dictate what I ought
9684: to do, from what is done.
9685: 
9686: We must, however, omit the consideration of these important subjects,
9687: the development of which is in reality the peculiar duty and dignity of
9688: philosophy, and confine ourselves for the present to the more humble
9689: but not less useful task of preparing a firm foundation for those
9690: majestic edifices of moral science. For this foundation has been
9691: hitherto insecure from the many subterranean passages which reason in
9692: its confident but vain search for treasures has made in all directions.
9693: Our present duty is to make ourselves perfectly acquainted with the
9694: transcendental use made of pure reason, its principles and ideas, that
9695: we may be able properly to determine and value its influence and real
9696: worth. But before bringing these introductory remarks to a close, I beg
9697: those who really have philosophy at heart—and their number is but
9698: small—if they shall find themselves convinced by the considerations
9699: following as well as by those above, to exert themselves to preserve to
9700: the expression idea its original signification, and to take care that
9701: it be not lost among those other expressions by which all sorts of
9702: representations are loosely designated—that the interests of science
9703: may not thereby suffer. We are in no want of words to denominate
9704: adequately every mode of representation, without the necessity of
9705: encroaching upon terms which are proper to others. The following is a
9706: graduated list of them. The genus is representation in general
9707: (representatio). Under it stands representation with consciousness
9708: (perceptio). A perception which relates solely to the subject as a
9709: modification of its state, is a sensation (sensatio), an objective
9710: perception is a cognition (cognitio). A cognition is either an
9711: intuition or a conception (intuitus vel conceptus). The former has an
9712: immediate relation to the object and is singular and individual; the
9713: latter has but a mediate relation, by means of a characteristic mark
9714: which may be common to several things. A conception is either empirical
9715: or pure. A pure conception, in so far as it has its origin in the
9716: understanding alone, and is not the conception of a pure sensuous
9717: image, is called notio. A conception formed from notions, which
9718: transcends the possibility of experience, is an idea, or a conception
9719: of reason. To one who has accustomed himself to these distinctions, it
9720: must be quite intolerable to hear the representation of the colour red
9721: called an idea. It ought not even to be called a notion or conception
9722: of understanding.
9723: 
9724: Section II. Of Transcendental Ideas
9725: 
9726: Transcendental analytic showed us how the mere logical form of our
9727: cognition can contain the origin of pure conceptions à priori,
9728: conceptions which represent objects antecedently to all experience, or
9729: rather, indicate the synthetical unity which alone renders possible an
9730: empirical cognition of objects. The form of judgements—converted into a
9731: conception of the synthesis of intuitions—produced the categories which
9732: direct the employment of the understanding in experience. This
9733: consideration warrants us to expect that the form of syllogisms, when
9734: applied to synthetical unity of intuitions, following the rule of the
9735: categories, will contain the origin of particular à priori conceptions,
9736: which we may call pure conceptions of reason or transcendental ideas,
9737: and which will determine the use of the understanding in the totality
9738: of experience according to principles.
9739: 
9740: The function of reason in arguments consists in the universality of a
9741: cognition according to conceptions, and the syllogism itself is a
9742: judgement which is determined à priori in the whole extent of its
9743: condition. The proposition: “Caius is mortal,” is one which may be
9744: obtained from experience by the aid of the understanding alone; but my
9745: wish is to find a conception which contains the condition under which
9746: the predicate of this judgement is given—in this case, the conception
9747: of man—and after subsuming under this condition, taken in its whole
9748: extent (all men are mortal), I determine according to it the cognition
9749: of the object thought, and say: “Caius is mortal.”
9750: 
9751: Hence, in the conclusion of a syllogism we restrict a predicate to a
9752: certain object, after having thought it in the major in its whole
9753: extent under a certain condition. This complete quantity of the extent
9754: in relation to such a condition is called universality (universalitas).
9755: To this corresponds totality (universitas) of conditions in the
9756: synthesis of intuitions. The transcendental conception of reason is
9757: therefore nothing else than the conception of the totality of the
9758: conditions of a given conditioned. Now as the unconditioned alone
9759: renders possible totality of conditions, and, conversely, the totality
9760: of conditions is itself always unconditioned; a pure rational
9761: conception in general can be defined and explained by means of the
9762: conception of the unconditioned, in so far as it contains a basis for
9763: the synthesis of the conditioned.
9764: 
9765: To the number of modes of relation which the understanding cogitates by
9766: means of the categories, the number of pure rational conceptions will
9767: correspond. We must therefore seek for, first, an unconditioned of the
9768: categorical synthesis in a subject; secondly, of the hypothetical
9769: synthesis of the members of a series; thirdly, of the disjunctive
9770: synthesis of parts in a system.
9771: 
9772: There are exactly the same number of modes of syllogisms, each of which
9773: proceeds through prosyllogisms to the unconditioned—one to the subject
9774: which cannot be employed as predicate, another to the presupposition
9775: which supposes nothing higher than itself, and the third to an
9776: aggregate of the members of the complete division of a conception.
9777: Hence the pure rational conceptions of totality in the synthesis of
9778: conditions have a necessary foundation in the nature of human reason—at
9779: least as modes of elevating the unity of the understanding to the
9780: unconditioned. They may have no valid application, corresponding to
9781: their transcendental employment, in concreto, and be thus of no greater
9782: utility than to direct the understanding how, while extending them as
9783: widely as possible, to maintain its exercise and application in perfect
9784: consistence and harmony.
9785: 
9786: But, while speaking here of the totality of conditions and of the
9787: unconditioned as the common title of all conceptions of reason, we
9788: again light upon an expression which we find it impossible to dispense
9789: with, and which nevertheless, owing to the ambiguity attaching to it
9790: from long abuse, we cannot employ with safety. The word absolute is one
9791: of the few words which, in its original signification, was perfectly
9792: adequate to the conception it was intended to convey—a conception which
9793: no other word in the same language exactly suits, and the loss—or,
9794: which is the same thing, the incautious and loose employment—of which
9795: must be followed by the loss of the conception itself. And, as it is a
9796: conception which occupies much of the attention of reason, its loss
9797: would be greatly to the detriment of all transcendental philosophy. The
9798: word absolute is at present frequently used to denote that something
9799: can be predicated of a thing considered in itself and intrinsically. In
9800: this sense absolutely possible would signify that which is possible in
9801: itself (interne)—which is, in fact, the least that one can predicate of
9802: an object. On the other hand, it is sometimes employed to indicate that
9803: a thing is valid in all respects—for example, absolute sovereignty.
9804: Absolutely possible would in this sense signify that which is possible
9805: in all relations and in every respect; and this is the most that can be
9806: predicated of the possibility of a thing. Now these significations do
9807: in truth frequently coincide. Thus, for example, that which is
9808: intrinsically impossible, is also impossible in all relations, that is,
9809: absolutely impossible. But in most cases they differ from each other
9810: toto caelo, and I can by no means conclude that, because a thing is in
9811: itself possible, it is also possible in all relations, and therefore
9812: absolutely. Nay, more, I shall in the sequel show that absolute
9813: necessity does not by any means depend on internal necessity, and that,
9814: therefore, it must not be considered as synonymous with it. Of an
9815: opposite which is intrinsically impossible, we may affirm that it is in
9816: all respects impossible, and that, consequently, the thing itself, of
9817: which this is the opposite, is absolutely necessary; but I cannot
9818: reason conversely and say, the opposite of that which is absolutely
9819: necessary is intrinsically impossible, that is, that the absolute
9820: necessity of things is an internal necessity. For this internal
9821: necessity is in certain cases a mere empty word with which the least
9822: conception cannot be connected, while the conception of the necessity
9823: of a thing in all relations possesses very peculiar determinations. Now
9824: as the loss of a conception of great utility in speculative science
9825: cannot be a matter of indifference to the philosopher, I trust that the
9826: proper determination and careful preservation of the expression on
9827: which the conception depends will likewise be not indifferent to him.
9828: 
9829: In this enlarged signification, then, shall I employ the word absolute,
9830: in opposition to that which is valid only in some particular respect;
9831: for the latter is restricted by conditions, the former is valid without
9832: any restriction whatever.
9833: 
9834: Now the transcendental conception of reason has for its object nothing
9835: else than absolute totality in the synthesis of conditions and does not
9836: rest satisfied till it has attained to the absolutely, that is, in all
9837: respects and relations, unconditioned. For pure reason leaves to the
9838: understanding everything that immediately relates to the object of
9839: intuition or rather to their synthesis in imagination. The former
9840: restricts itself to the absolute totality in the employment of the
9841: conceptions of the understanding and aims at carrying out the
9842: synthetical unity which is cogitated in the category, even to the
9843: unconditioned. This unity may hence be called the rational unity of
9844: phenomena, as the other, which the category expresses, may be termed
9845: the unity of the understanding. Reason, therefore, has an immediate
9846: relation to the use of the understanding, not indeed in so far as the
9847: latter contains the ground of possible experience (for the conception
9848: of the absolute totality of conditions is not a conception that can be
9849: employed in experience, because no experience is unconditioned), but
9850: solely for the purpose of directing it to a certain unity, of which the
9851: understanding has no conception, and the aim of which is to collect
9852: into an absolute whole all acts of the understanding. Hence the
9853: objective employment of the pure conceptions of reason is always
9854: transcendent, while that of the pure conceptions of the understanding
9855: must, according to their nature, be always immanent, inasmuch as they
9856: are limited to possible experience.
9857: 
9858: I understand by idea a necessary conception of reason, to which no
9859: corresponding object can be discovered in the world of sense.
9860: Accordingly, the pure conceptions of reason at present under
9861: consideration are transcendental ideas. They are conceptions of pure
9862: reason, for they regard all empirical cognition as determined by means
9863: of an absolute totality of conditions. They are not mere fictions, but
9864: natural and necessary products of reason, and have hence a necessary
9865: relation to the whole sphere of the exercise of the understanding. And,
9866: finally, they are transcendent, and overstep the limits of all
9867: experiences, in which, consequently, no object can ever be presented
9868: that would be perfectly adequate to a transcendental idea. When we use
9869: the word idea, we say, as regards its object (an object of the pure
9870: understanding), a great deal, but as regards its subject (that is, in
9871: respect of its reality under conditions of experience), exceedingly
9872: little, because the idea, as the conception of a maximum, can never be
9873: completely and adequately presented in concreto. Now, as in the merely
9874: speculative employment of reason the latter is properly the sole aim,
9875: and as in this case the approximation to a conception, which is never
9876: attained in practice, is the same thing as if the conception were
9877: non-existent—it is commonly said of the conception of this kind, “it is
9878: only an idea.” So we might very well say, “the absolute totality of all
9879: phenomena is only an idea,” for, as we never can present an adequate
9880: representation of it, it remains for us a problem incapable of
9881: solution. On the other hand, as in the practical use of the
9882: understanding we have only to do with action and practice according to
9883: rules, an idea of pure reason can always be given really in concreto,
9884: although only partially, nay, it is the indispensable condition of all
9885: practical employment of reason. The practice or execution of the idea
9886: is always limited and defective, but nevertheless within indeterminable
9887: boundaries, consequently always under the influence of the conception
9888: of an absolute perfection. And thus the practical idea is always in the
9889: highest degree fruitful, and in relation to real actions indispensably
9890: necessary. In the idea, pure reason possesses even causality and the
9891: power of producing that which its conception contains. Hence we cannot
9892: say of wisdom, in a disparaging way, “it is only an idea.” For, for the
9893: very reason that it is the idea of the necessary unity of all possible
9894: aims, it must be for all practical exertions and endeavours the
9895: primitive condition and rule—a rule which, if not constitutive, is at
9896: least limitative.
9897: 
9898: Now, although we must say of the transcendental conceptions of reason,
9899: “they are only ideas,” we must not, on this account, look upon them as
9900: superfluous and nugatory. For, although no object can be determined by
9901: them, they can be of great utility, unobserved and at the basis of the
9902: edifice of the understanding, as the canon for its extended and
9903: self-consistent exercise—a canon which, indeed, does not enable it to
9904: cognize more in an object than it would cognize by the help of its own
9905: conceptions, but which guides it more securely in its cognition. Not to
9906: mention that they perhaps render possible a transition from our
9907: conceptions of nature and the non-ego to the practical conceptions, and
9908: thus produce for even ethical ideas keeping, so to speak, and
9909: connection with the speculative cognitions of reason. The explication
9910: of all this must be looked for in the sequel.
9911: 
9912: But setting aside, in conformity with our original purpose, the
9913: consideration of the practical ideas, we proceed to contemplate reason
9914: in its speculative use alone, nay, in a still more restricted sphere,
9915: to wit, in the transcendental use; and here must strike into the same
9916: path which we followed in our deduction of the categories. That is to
9917: say, we shall consider the logical form of the cognition of reason,
9918: that we may see whether reason may not be thereby a source of
9919: conceptions which enables us to regard objects in themselves as
9920: determined synthetically à priori, in relation to one or other of the
9921: functions of reason.
9922: 
9923: Reason, considered as the faculty of a certain logical form of
9924: cognition, is the faculty of conclusion, that is, of mediate
9925: judgement—by means of the subsumption of the condition of a possible
9926: judgement under the condition of a given judgement. The given judgement
9927: is the general rule (major). The subsumption of the condition of
9928: another possible judgement under the condition of the rule is the
9929: minor. The actual judgement, which enounces the assertion of the rule
9930: in the subsumed case, is the conclusion (conclusio). The rule
9931: predicates something generally under a certain condition. The condition
9932: of the rule is satisfied in some particular case. It follows that what
9933: was valid in general under that condition must also be considered as
9934: valid in the particular case which satisfies this condition. It is very
9935: plain that reason attains to a cognition, by means of acts of the
9936: understanding which constitute a series of conditions. When I arrive at
9937: the proposition, “All bodies are changeable,” by beginning with the
9938: more remote cognition (in which the conception of body does not appear,
9939: but which nevertheless contains the condition of that conception), “All
9940: compound is changeable,” by proceeding from this to a less remote
9941: cognition, which stands under the condition of the former, “Bodies are
9942: compound,” and hence to a third, which at length connects for me the
9943: remote cognition (changeable) with the one before me, “Consequently,
9944: bodies are changeable”—I have arrived at a cognition (conclusion)
9945: through a series of conditions (premisses). Now every series, whose
9946: exponent (of the categorical or hypothetical judgement) is given, can
9947: be continued; consequently the same procedure of reason conducts us to
9948: the ratiocinatio polysyllogistica, which is a series of syllogisms,
9949: that can be continued either on the side of the conditions (per
9950: prosyllogismos) or of the conditioned (per episyllogismos) to an
9951: indefinite extent.
9952: 
9953: But we very soon perceive that the chain or series of prosyllogisms,
9954: that is, of deduced cognitions on the side of the grounds or conditions
9955: of a given cognition, in other words, the ascending series of
9956: syllogisms must have a very different relation to the faculty of reason
9957: from that of the descending series, that is, the progressive procedure
9958: of reason on the side of the conditioned by means of episyllogisms.
9959: For, as in the former case the cognition (conclusio) is given only as
9960: conditioned, reason can attain to this cognition only under the
9961: presupposition that all the members of the series on the side of the
9962: conditions are given (totality in the series of premisses), because
9963: only under this supposition is the judgement we may be considering
9964: possible à priori; while on the side of the conditioned or the
9965: inferences, only an incomplete and becoming, and not a presupposed or
9966: given series, consequently only a potential progression, is cogitated.
9967: Hence, when a cognition is contemplated as conditioned, reason is
9968: compelled to consider the series of conditions in an ascending line as
9969: completed and given in their totality. But if the very same condition
9970: is considered at the same time as the condition of other cognitions,
9971: which together constitute a series of inferences or consequences in a
9972: descending line, reason may preserve a perfect indifference, as to how
9973: far this progression may extend _a parte posteriori_, and whether the
9974: totality of this series is possible, because it stands in no need of
9975: such a series for the purpose of arriving at the conclusion before it,
9976: inasmuch as this conclusion is sufficiently guaranteed and determined
9977: on grounds a parte priori. It may be the case, that upon the side of
9978: the conditions the series of premisses has a first or highest
9979: condition, or it may not possess this, and so be a parte priori
9980: unlimited; but it must, nevertheless, contain totality of conditions,
9981: even admitting that we never could succeed in completely apprehending
9982: it; and the whole series must be unconditionally true, if the
9983: conditioned, which is considered as an inference resulting from it, is
9984: to be held as true. This is a requirement of reason, which announces
9985: its cognition as determined à priori and as necessary, either in
9986: itself—and in this case it needs no grounds to rest upon—or, if it is
9987: deduced, as a member of a series of grounds, which is itself
9988: unconditionally true.
9989: 
9990: Section III. System of Transcendental Ideas
9991: 
9992: We are not at present engaged with a logical dialectic, which makes
9993: complete abstraction of the content of cognition and aims only at
9994: unveiling the illusory appearance in the form of syllogisms. Our
9995: subject is transcendental dialectic, which must contain, completely à
9996: priori, the origin of certain cognitions drawn from pure reason, and
9997: the origin of certain deduced conceptions, the object of which cannot
9998: be given empirically and which therefore lie beyond the sphere of the
9999: faculty of understanding. We have observed, from the natural relation
10000: which the transcendental use of our cognition, in syllogisms as well as
10001: in judgements, must have to the logical, that there are three kinds of
10002: dialectical arguments, corresponding to the three modes of conclusion,
10003: by which reason attains to cognitions on principles; and that in all it
10004: is the business of reason to ascend from the conditioned synthesis,
10005: beyond which the understanding never proceeds, to the unconditioned
10006: which the understanding never can reach.
10007: 
10008: Now the most general relations which can exist in our representations
10009: are: 1st, the relation to the subject; 2nd, the relation to objects,
10010: either as phenomena, or as objects of thought in general. If we connect
10011: this subdivision with the main division, all the relations of our
10012: representations, of which we can form either a conception or an idea,
10013: are threefold: 1. The relation to the subject; 2. The relation to the
10014: manifold of the object as a phenomenon; 3. The relation to all things
10015: in general.
10016: 
10017: Now all pure conceptions have to do in general with the synthetical
10018: unity of representations; conceptions of pure reason (transcendental
10019: ideas), on the other hand, with the unconditional synthetical unity of
10020: all conditions. It follows that all transcendental ideas arrange
10021: themselves in three classes, the first of which contains the absolute
10022: (unconditioned) unity of the thinking subject, the second the absolute
10023: unity of the series of the conditions of a phenomenon, the third the
10024: absolute unity of the condition of all objects of thought in general.
10025: 
10026: The thinking subject is the object-matter of Psychology; the sum total
10027: of all phenomena (the world) is the object-matter of Cosmology; and the
10028: thing which contains the highest condition of the possibility of all
10029: that is cogitable (the being of all beings) is the object-matter of all
10030: Theology. Thus pure reason presents us with the idea of a
10031: transcendental doctrine of the soul (psychologia rationalis), of a
10032: transcendental science of the world (cosmologia rationalis), and
10033: finally of a transcendental doctrine of God (theologia
10034: transcendentalis). Understanding cannot originate even the outline of
10035: any of these sciences, even when connected with the highest logical use
10036: of reason, that is, all cogitable syllogisms—for the purpose of
10037: proceeding from one object (phenomenon) to all others, even to the
10038: utmost limits of the empirical synthesis. They are, on the contrary,
10039: pure and genuine products, or problems, of pure reason.
10040: 
10041: What modi of the pure conceptions of reason these transcendental ideas
10042: are will be fully exposed in the following chapter. They follow the
10043: guiding thread of the categories. For pure reason never relates
10044: immediately to objects, but to the conceptions of these contained in
10045: the understanding. In like manner, it will be made manifest in the
10046: detailed explanation of these ideas—how reason, merely through the
10047: synthetical use of the same function which it employs in a categorical
10048: syllogism, necessarily attains to the conception of the absolute unity
10049: of the thinking subject—how the logical procedure in hypothetical ideas
10050: necessarily produces the idea of the absolutely unconditioned in a
10051: series of given conditions, and finally—how the mere form of the
10052: disjunctive syllogism involves the highest conception of a being of all
10053: beings: a thought which at first sight seems in the highest degree
10054: paradoxical.
10055: 
10056: An objective deduction, such as we were able to present in the case of
10057: the categories, is impossible as regards these transcendental ideas.
10058: For they have, in truth, no relation to any object, in experience, for
10059: the very reason that they are only ideas. But a subjective deduction of
10060: them from the nature of our reason is possible, and has been given in
10061: the present chapter.
10062: 
10063: It is easy to perceive that the sole aim of pure reason is the absolute
10064: totality of the synthesis on the side of the conditions, and that it
10065: does not concern itself with the absolute completeness on the Part of
10066: the conditioned. For of the former alone does she stand in need, in
10067: order to preposit the whole series of conditions, and thus present them
10068: to the understanding à priori. But if we once have a completely (and
10069: unconditionally) given condition, there is no further necessity, in
10070: proceeding with the series, for a conception of reason; for the
10071: understanding takes of itself every step downward, from the condition
10072: to the conditioned. Thus the transcendental ideas are available only
10073: for ascending in the series of conditions, till we reach the
10074: unconditioned, that is, principles. As regards descending to the
10075: conditioned, on the other hand, we find that there is a widely
10076: extensive logical use which reason makes of the laws of the
10077: understanding, but that a transcendental use thereof is impossible; and
10078: that when we form an idea of the absolute totality of such a synthesis,
10079: for example, of the whole series of all future changes in the world,
10080: this idea is a mere ens rationis, an arbitrary fiction of thought, and
10081: not a necessary presupposition of reason. For the possibility of the
10082: conditioned presupposes the totality of its conditions, but not of its
10083: consequences. Consequently, this conception is not a transcendental
10084: idea—and it is with these alone that we are at present occupied.
10085: 
10086: Finally, it is obvious that there exists among the transcendental ideas
10087: a certain connection and unity, and that pure reason, by means of them,
10088: collects all its cognitions into one system. From the cognition of self
10089: to the cognition of the world, and through these to the supreme being,
10090: the progression is so natural, that it seems to resemble the logical
10091: march of reason from the premisses to the conclusion.[42] Now whether
10092: there lies unobserved at the foundation of these ideas an analogy of
10093: the same kind as exists between the logical and transcendental
10094: procedure of reason, is another of those questions, the answer to which
10095: we must not expect till we arrive at a more advanced stage in our
10096: inquiries. In this cursory and preliminary view, we have, meanwhile,
10097: reached our aim. For we have dispelled the ambiguity which attached to
10098: the transcendental conceptions of reason, from their being commonly
10099: mixed up with other conceptions in the systems of philosophers, and not
10100: properly distinguished from the conceptions of the understanding; we
10101: have exposed their origin and, thereby, at the same time their
10102: determinate number, and presented them in a systematic connection, and
10103: have thus marked out and enclosed a definite sphere for pure reason.
10104: 
10105:  [42] The science of Metaphysics has for the proper object of its
10106:  inquiries only three grand ideas: GOD, FREEDOM, and IMMORTALITY, and
10107:  it aims at showing, that the second conception, conjoined with the
10108:  first, must lead to the third, as a necessary conclusion. All the
10109:  other subjects with which it occupies itself, are merely means for the
10110:  attainment and realization of these ideas. It does not require these
10111:  ideas for the construction of a science of nature, but, on the
10112:  contrary, for the purpose of passing beyond the sphere of nature. A
10113:  complete insight into and comprehension of them would render Theology,
10114:  Ethics, and, through the conjunction of both, Religion, solely
10115:  dependent on the speculative faculty of reason. In a systematic
10116:  representation of these ideas the above-mentioned arrangement—the
10117:  synthetical one—would be the most suitable; but in the investigation
10118:  which must necessarily precede it, the analytical, which reverses this
10119:  arrangement, would be better adapted to our purpose, as in it we
10120:  should proceed from that which experience immediately presents to
10121:  us—psychology, to cosmology, and thence to theology.
10122: 
10123: TRANSCENDENTAL DIALECTIC—BOOK II—OF THE DIALECTICAL PROCEDURE OF PURE
10124: REASON
10125: 
10126: It may be said that the object of a merely transcendental idea is
10127: something of which we have no conception, although the idea may be a
10128: necessary product of reason according to its original laws. For, in
10129: fact, a conception of an object that is adequate to the idea given by
10130: reason, is impossible. For such an object must be capable of being
10131: presented and intuited in a Possible experience. But we should express
10132: our meaning better, and with less risk of being misunderstood, if we
10133: said that we can have no knowledge of an object, which perfectly
10134: corresponds to an idea, although we may possess a problematical
10135: conception thereof.
10136: 
10137: Now the transcendental (subjective) reality at least of the pure
10138: conceptions of reason rests upon the fact that we are led to such ideas
10139: by a necessary procedure of reason. There must therefore be syllogisms
10140: which contain no empirical premisses, and by means of which we conclude
10141: from something that we do know, to something of which we do not even
10142: possess a conception, to which we, nevertheless, by an unavoidable
10143: illusion, ascribe objective reality. Such arguments are, as regards
10144: their result, rather to be termed sophisms than syllogisms, although
10145: indeed, as regards their origin, they are very well entitled to the
10146: latter name, inasmuch as they are not fictions or accidental products
10147: of reason, but are necessitated by its very nature. They are sophisms,
10148: not of men, but of pure reason herself, from which the Wisest cannot
10149: free himself. After long labour he may be able to guard against the
10150: error, but he can never be thoroughly rid of the illusion which
10151: continually mocks and misleads him.
10152: 
10153: Of these dialectical arguments there are three kinds, corresponding to
10154: the number of the ideas which their conclusions present. In the
10155: argument or syllogism of the first class, I conclude, from the
10156: transcendental conception of the subject contains no manifold, the
10157: absolute unity of the subject itself, of which I cannot in this manner
10158: attain to a conception. This dialectical argument I shall call the
10159: transcendental paralogism. The second class of sophistical arguments is
10160: occupied with the transcendental conception of the absolute totality of
10161: the series of conditions for a given phenomenon, and I conclude, from
10162: the fact that I have always a self-contradictory conception of the
10163: unconditioned synthetical unity of the series upon one side, the truth
10164: of the opposite unity, of which I have nevertheless no conception. The
10165: condition of reason in these dialectical arguments, I shall term the
10166: antinomy of pure reason. Finally, according to the third kind of
10167: sophistical argument, I conclude, from the totality of the conditions
10168: of thinking objects in general, in so far as they can be given, the
10169: absolute synthetical unity of all conditions of the possibility of
10170: things in general; that is, from things which I do not know in their
10171: mere transcendental conception, I conclude a being of all beings which
10172: I know still less by means of a transcendental conception, and of whose
10173: unconditioned necessity I can form no conception whatever. This
10174: dialectical argument I shall call the ideal of pure reason.
10175: 
10176: Chapter I. Of the Paralogisms of Pure Reason
10177: 
10178: The logical paralogism consists in the falsity of an argument in
10179: respect of its form, be the content what it may. But a transcendental
10180: paralogism has a transcendental foundation, and concludes falsely,
10181: while the form is correct and unexceptionable. In this manner the
10182: paralogism has its foundation in the nature of human reason, and is the
10183: parent of an unavoidable, though not insoluble, mental illusion.
10184: 
10185: We now come to a conception which was not inserted in the general list
10186: of transcendental conceptions, and yet must be reckoned with them, but
10187: at the same time without in the least altering, or indicating a
10188: deficiency in that table. This is the conception, or, if the term is
10189: preferred, the judgement, “I think.” But it is readily perceived that
10190: this thought is as it were the vehicle of all conceptions in general,
10191: and consequently of transcendental conceptions also, and that it is
10192: therefore regarded as a transcendental conception, although it can have
10193: no peculiar claim to be so ranked, inasmuch as its only use is to
10194: indicate that all thought is accompanied by consciousness. At the same
10195: time, pure as this conception is from empirical content (impressions of
10196: the senses), it enables us to distinguish two different kinds of
10197: objects. “I,” as thinking, am an object of the internal sense, and am
10198: called soul. That which is an object of the external senses is called
10199: body. Thus the expression, “I,” as a thinking being, designates the
10200: object-matter of psychology, which may be called “the rational doctrine
10201: of the soul,” inasmuch as in this science I desire to know nothing of
10202: the soul but what, independently of all experience (which determines me
10203: in concreto), may be concluded from this conception “I,” in so far as
10204: it appears in all thought.
10205: 
10206: Now, the rational doctrine of the soul is really an undertaking of this
10207: kind. For if the smallest empirical element of thought, if any
10208: particular perception of my internal state, were to be introduced among
10209: the grounds of cognition of this science, it would not be a rational,
10210: but an empirical doctrine of the soul. We have thus before us a
10211: pretended science, raised upon the single proposition, “I think,” whose
10212: foundation or want of foundation we may very properly, and agreeably
10213: with the nature of a transcendental philosophy, here examine. It ought
10214: not to be objected that in this proposition, which expresses the
10215: perception of one’s self, an internal experience is asserted, and that
10216: consequently the rational doctrine of the soul which is founded upon
10217: it, is not pure, but partly founded upon an empirical principle. For
10218: this internal perception is nothing more than the mere apperception, “I
10219: think,” which in fact renders all transcendental conceptions possible,
10220: in which we say, “I think substance, cause, etc.” For internal
10221: experience in general and its possibility, or perception in general,
10222: and its relation to other perceptions, unless some particular
10223: distinction or determination thereof is empirically given, cannot be
10224: regarded as empirical cognition, but as cognition of the empirical, and
10225: belongs to the investigation of the possibility of every experience,
10226: which is certainly transcendental. The smallest object of experience
10227: (for example, only pleasure or pain), that should be included in the
10228: general representation of self-consciousness, would immediately change
10229: the rational into an empirical psychology.
10230: 
10231: “I think” is therefore the only text of rational psychology, from which
10232: it must develop its whole system. It is manifest that this thought,
10233: when applied to an object (myself), can contain nothing but
10234: transcendental predicates thereof; because the least empirical
10235: predicate would destroy the purity of the science and its independence
10236: of all experience.
10237: 
10238: But we shall have to follow here the guidance of the categories—only,
10239: as in the present case a thing, “I,” as thinking being, is at first
10240: given, we shall—not indeed change the order of the categories as it
10241: stands in the table—but begin at the category of substance, by which at
10242: the a thing in itself is represented and proceeds backwards through the
10243: series. The topic of the rational doctrine of the soul, from which
10244: everything else it may contain must be deduced, is accordingly as
10245: follows:
10246: 
10247:             1                          2
10248:   The Soul is SUBSTANCE       As regards its quality
10249:                                 it is SIMPLE
10250: 
10251:                       3
10252:           As regards the different
10253:           times in which it exists,
10254:           it is numerically identical,
10255:           that is UNITY, not Plurality.
10256: 
10257:                        4
10258:   It is in relation to possible objects in space[43]
10259: 
10260:  [43] The reader, who may not so easily perceive the psychological
10261:  sense of these expressions, taken here in their transcendental
10262:  abstraction, and cannot guess why the latter attribute of the soul
10263:  belongs to the category of existence, will find the expressions
10264:  sufficiently explained and justified in the sequel. I have, moreover,
10265:  to apologize for the Latin terms which have been employed, instead of
10266:  their German synonyms, contrary to the rules of correct writing. But I
10267:  judged it better to sacrifice elegance to perspicuity.
10268: 
10269: 
10270: From these elements originate all the conceptions of pure psychology,
10271: by combination alone, without the aid of any other principle. This
10272: substance, merely as an object of the internal sense, gives the
10273: conception of Immateriality; as simple substance, that of
10274: Incorruptibility; its identity, as intellectual substance, gives the
10275: conception of Personality; all these three together, Spirituality. Its
10276: relation to objects in space gives us the conception of connection
10277: (commercium) with bodies. Thus it represents thinking substance as the
10278: principle of life in matter, that is, as a soul (anima), and as the
10279: ground of Animality; and this, limited and determined by the conception
10280: of spirituality, gives us that of Immortality.
10281: 
10282: Now to these conceptions relate four paralogisms of a transcendental
10283: psychology, which is falsely held to be a science of pure reason,
10284: touching the nature of our thinking being. We can, however, lay at the
10285: foundation of this science nothing but the simple and in itself
10286: perfectly contentless representation “i” which cannot even be called a
10287: conception, but merely a consciousness which accompanies all
10288: conceptions. By this “I,” or “He,” or “It,” who or which thinks,
10289: nothing more is represented than a transcendental subject of thought =
10290: x, which is cognized only by means of the thoughts that are its
10291: predicates, and of which, apart from these, we cannot form the least
10292: conception. Hence in a perpetual circle, inasmuch as we must always
10293: employ it, in order to frame any judgement respecting it. And this
10294: inconvenience we find it impossible to rid ourselves of, because
10295: consciousness in itself is not so much a representation distinguishing
10296: a particular object, as a form of representation in general, in so far
10297: as it may be termed cognition; for in and by cognition alone do I think
10298: anything.
10299: 
10300: It must, however, appear extraordinary at first sight that the
10301: condition under which I think, and which is consequently a property of
10302: my subject, should be held to be likewise valid for every existence
10303: which thinks, and that we can presume to base upon a seemingly
10304: empirical proposition a judgement which is apodeictic and universal, to
10305: wit, that everything which thinks is constituted as the voice of my
10306: consciousness declares it to be, that is, as a self-conscious being.
10307: The cause of this belief is to be found in the fact that we necessarily
10308: attribute to things à priori all the properties which constitute
10309: conditions under which alone we can cogitate them. Now I cannot obtain
10310: the least representation of a thinking being by means of external
10311: experience, but solely through self-consciousness. Such objects are
10312: consequently nothing more than the transference of this consciousness
10313: of mine to other things which can only thus be represented as thinking
10314: beings. The proposition, “I think,” is, in the present case, understood
10315: in a problematical sense, not in so far as it contains a perception of
10316: an existence (like the Cartesian “Cogito, ergo sum”), but in regard to
10317: its mere possibility—for the purpose of discovering what properties may
10318: be inferred from so simple a proposition and predicated of the subject
10319: of it.
10320: 
10321: If at the foundation of our pure rational cognition of thinking beings
10322: there lay more than the mere Cogito—if we could likewise call in aid
10323: observations on the play of our thoughts, and the thence derived
10324: natural laws of the thinking self, there would arise an empirical
10325: psychology which would be a kind of physiology of the internal sense
10326: and might possibly be capable of explaining the phenomena of that
10327: sense. But it could never be available for discovering those properties
10328: which do not belong to possible experience (such as the quality of
10329: simplicity), nor could it make any apodeictic enunciation on the nature
10330: of thinking beings: it would therefore not be a rational psychology.
10331: 
10332: Now, as the proposition “I think” (in the problematical sense) contains
10333: the form of every judgement in general and is the constant
10334: accompaniment of all the categories, it is manifest that conclusions
10335: are drawn from it only by a transcendental employment of the
10336: understanding. This use of the understanding excludes all empirical
10337: elements; and we cannot, as has been shown above, have any favourable
10338: conception beforehand of its procedure. We shall therefore follow with
10339: a critical eye this proposition through all the predicaments of pure
10340: psychology; but we shall, for brevity’s sake, allow this examination to
10341: proceed in an uninterrupted connection.
10342: 
10343: Before entering on this task, however, the following general remark may
10344: help to quicken our attention to this mode of argument. It is not
10345: merely through my thinking that I cognize an object, but only through
10346: my determining a given intuition in relation to the unity of
10347: consciousness in which all thinking consists. It follows that I cognize
10348: myself, not through my being conscious of myself as thinking, but only
10349: when I am conscious of the intuition of myself as determined in
10350: relation to the function of thought. All the modi of self-consciousness
10351: in thought are hence not conceptions of objects (conceptions of the
10352: understanding—categories); they are mere logical functions, which do
10353: not present to thought an object to be cognized, and cannot therefore
10354: present my Self as an object. Not the consciousness of the determining,
10355: but only that of the determinable self, that is, of my internal
10356: intuition (in so far as the manifold contained in it can be connected
10357: conformably with the general condition of the unity of apperception in
10358: thought), is the object.
10359: 
10360: 1. In all judgements I am the determining subject of that relation
10361: which constitutes a judgement. But that the I which thinks, must be
10362: considered as in thought always a subject, and as a thing which cannot
10363: be a predicate to thought, is an apodeictic and identical proposition.
10364: But this proposition does not signify that I, as an object, am, for
10365: myself, a self-subsistent being or substance. This latter statement—an
10366: ambitious one—requires to be supported by data which are not to be
10367: discovered in thought; and are perhaps (in so far as I consider the
10368: thinking self merely as such) not to be discovered in the thinking self
10369: at all.
10370: 
10371: 2. That the I or Ego of apperception, and consequently in all thought,
10372: is singular or simple, and cannot be resolved into a plurality of
10373: subjects, and therefore indicates a logically simple subject—this is
10374: self-evident from the very conception of an Ego, and is consequently an
10375: analytical proposition. But this is not tantamount to declaring that
10376: the thinking Ego is a simple substance—for this would be a synthetical
10377: proposition. The conception of substance always relates to intuitions,
10378: which with me cannot be other than sensuous, and which consequently lie
10379: completely out of the sphere of the understanding and its thought: but
10380: to this sphere belongs the affirmation that the Ego is simple in
10381: thought. It would indeed be surprising, if the conception of
10382: “substance,” which in other cases requires so much labour to
10383: distinguish from the other elements presented by intuition—so much
10384: trouble, too, to discover whether it can be simple (as in the case of
10385: the parts of matter)—should be presented immediately to me, as if by
10386: revelation, in the poorest mental representation of all.
10387: 
10388: 3. The proposition of the identity of my Self amidst all the manifold
10389: representations of which I am conscious, is likewise a proposition
10390: lying in the conceptions themselves, and is consequently analytical.
10391: But this identity of the subject, of which I am conscious in all its
10392: representations, does not relate to or concern the intuition of the
10393: subject, by which it is given as an object. This proposition cannot
10394: therefore enounce the identity of the person, by which is understood
10395: the consciousness of the identity of its own substance as a thinking
10396: being in all change and variation of circumstances. To prove this, we
10397: should require not a mere analysis of the proposition, but synthetical
10398: judgements based upon a given intuition.
10399: 
10400: 4. I distinguish my own existence, as that of a thinking being, from
10401: that of other things external to me—among which my body also is
10402: reckoned. This is also an analytical proposition, for other things are
10403: exactly those which I think as different or distinguished from myself.
10404: But whether this consciousness of myself is possible without things
10405: external to me; and whether therefore I can exist merely as a thinking
10406: being (without being man)—cannot be known or inferred from this
10407: proposition.
10408: 
10409: Thus we have gained nothing as regards the cognition of myself as
10410: object, by the analysis of the consciousness of my Self in thought. The
10411: logical exposition of thought in general is mistaken for a metaphysical
10412: determination of the object.
10413: 
10414: Our Critique would be an investigation utterly superfluous, if there
10415: existed a possibility of proving à priori, that all thinking beings are
10416: in themselves simple substances, as such, therefore, possess the
10417: inseparable attribute of personality, and are conscious of their
10418: existence apart from and unconnected with matter. For we should thus
10419: have taken a step beyond the world of sense, and have penetrated into
10420: the sphere of noumena; and in this case the right could not be denied
10421: us of extending our knowledge in this sphere, of establishing
10422: ourselves, and, under a favouring star, appropriating to ourselves
10423: possessions in it. For the proposition: “Every thinking being, as such,
10424: is simple substance,” is an à priori synthetical proposition; because
10425: in the first place it goes beyond the conception which is the subject
10426: of it, and adds to the mere notion of a thinking being the mode of its
10427: existence, and in the second place annexes a predicate (that of
10428: simplicity) to the latter conception—a predicate which it could not
10429: have discovered in the sphere of experience. It would follow that à
10430: priori synthetical propositions are possible and legitimate, not only,
10431: as we have maintained, in relation to objects of possible experience,
10432: and as principles of the possibility of this experience itself, but are
10433: applicable to things in themselves—an inference which makes an end of
10434: the whole of this Critique, and obliges us to fall back on the old mode
10435: of metaphysical procedure. But indeed the danger is not so great, if we
10436: look a little closer into the question.
10437: 
10438: There lurks in the procedure of rational Psychology a paralogism, which
10439: is represented in the following syllogism:
10440: 
10441: That which cannot be cogitated otherwise than as subject, does not
10442: exist otherwise than as subject, and is therefore substance.
10443: 
10444: A thinking being, considered merely as such, cannot be cogitated
10445: otherwise than as subject.
10446: 
10447: Therefore it exists also as such, that is, as substance.
10448: 
10449: In the major we speak of a being that can be cogitated generally and in
10450: every relation, consequently as it may be given in intuition. But in
10451: the minor we speak of the same being only in so far as it regards
10452: itself as subject, relatively to thought and the unity of
10453: consciousness, but not in relation to intuition, by which it is
10454: presented as an object to thought. Thus the conclusion is here arrived
10455: at by a Sophisma figurae dictionis.[44]
10456: 
10457:  [44] Thought is taken in the two premisses in two totally different
10458:  senses. In the major it is considered as relating and applying to
10459:  objects in general, consequently to objects of intuition also. In the
10460:  minor, we understand it as relating merely to self-consciousness. In
10461:  this sense, we do not cogitate an object, but merely the relation to
10462:  the self-consciousness of the subject, as the form of thought. In the
10463:  former premiss we speak of things which cannot be cogitated otherwise
10464:  than as subjects. In the second, we do not speak of things, but of
10465:  thought (all objects being abstracted), in which the Ego is always the
10466:  subject of consciousness. Hence the conclusion cannot be, “I cannot
10467:  exist otherwise than as subject”; but only “I can, in cogitating my
10468:  existence, employ my Ego only as the subject of the judgement.” But
10469:  this is an identical proposition, and throws no light on the mode of
10470:  my existence.
10471: 
10472: 
10473: That this famous argument is a mere paralogism, will be plain to any
10474: one who will consider the general remark which precedes our exposition
10475: of the principles of the pure understanding, and the section on
10476: noumena. For it was there proved that the conception of a thing, which
10477: can exist per se—only as a subject and never as a predicate, possesses
10478: no objective reality; that is to say, we can never know whether there
10479: exists any object to correspond to the conception; consequently, the
10480: conception is nothing more than a conception, and from it we derive no
10481: proper knowledge. If this conception is to indicate by the term
10482: substance, an object that can be given, if it is to become a cognition,
10483: we must have at the foundation of the cognition a permanent intuition,
10484: as the indispensable condition of its objective reality. For through
10485: intuition alone can an object be given. But in internal intuition there
10486: is nothing permanent, for the Ego is but the consciousness of my
10487: thought. If then, we appeal merely to thought, we cannot discover the
10488: necessary condition of the application of the conception of
10489: substance—that is, of a subject existing per se—to the subject as a
10490: thinking being. And thus the conception of the simple nature of
10491: substance, which is connected with the objective reality of this
10492: conception, is shown to be also invalid, and to be, in fact, nothing
10493: more than the logical qualitative unity of self-consciousness in
10494: thought; whilst we remain perfectly ignorant whether the subject is
10495: composite or not.
10496: 
10497: Refutation of the Argument of Mendelssohn for the Substantiality or
10498: Permanence of the Soul.
10499: 
10500: This acute philosopher easily perceived the insufficiency of the common
10501: argument which attempts to prove that the soul—it being granted that it
10502: is a simple being—cannot perish by dissolution or decomposition; he saw
10503: it is not impossible for it to cease to be by extinction, or
10504: disappearance. He endeavoured to prove in his Phaedo, that the soul
10505: cannot be annihilated, by showing that a simple being cannot cease to
10506: exist. Inasmuch as, he said, a simple existence cannot diminish, nor
10507: gradually lose portions of its being, and thus be by degrees reduced to
10508: nothing (for it possesses no parts, and therefore no multiplicity),
10509: between the moment in which it is, and the moment in which it is not,
10510: no time can be discovered—which is impossible. But this philosopher did
10511: not consider that, granting the soul to possess this simple nature,
10512: which contains no parts external to each other and consequently no
10513: extensive quantity, we cannot refuse to it any less than to any other
10514: being, intensive quantity, that is, a degree of reality in regard to
10515: all its faculties, nay, to all that constitutes its existence. But this
10516: degree of reality can become less and less through an infinite series
10517: of smaller degrees. It follows, therefore, that this supposed
10518: substance—this thing, the permanence of which is not assured in any
10519: other way, may, if not by decomposition, by gradual loss (remissio) of
10520: its powers (consequently by elanguescence, if I may employ this
10521: expression), be changed into nothing. For consciousness itself has
10522: always a degree, which may be lessened.[45] Consequently the faculty of
10523: being conscious may be diminished; and so with all other faculties. The
10524: permanence of the soul, therefore, as an object of the internal sense,
10525: remains undemonstrated, nay, even indemonstrable. Its permanence in
10526: life is evident, per se, inasmuch as the thinking being (as man) is to
10527: itself, at the same time, an object of the external senses. But this
10528: does not authorize the rational psychologist to affirm, from mere
10529: conceptions, its permanence beyond life.[46]
10530: 
10531:  [45] Clearness is not, as logicians maintain, the consciousness of a
10532:  representation. For a certain degree of consciousness, which may not,
10533:  however, be sufficient for recollection, is to be met with in many dim
10534:  representations. For without any consciousness at all, we should not
10535:  be able to recognize any difference in the obscure representations we
10536:  connect; as we really can do with many conceptions, such as those of
10537:  right and justice, and those of the musician, who strikes at once
10538:  several notes in improvising a piece of music. But a representation is
10539:  clear, in which our consciousness is sufficient for the consciousness
10540:  of the difference of this representation from others. If we are only
10541:  conscious that there is a difference, but are not conscious of the
10542:  difference—that is, what the difference is—the representation must be
10543:  termed obscure. There is, consequently, an infinite series of degrees
10544:  of consciousness down to its entire disappearance.
10545: 
10546: 
10547:  [46] There are some who think they have done enough to establish a new
10548:  possibility in the mode of the existence of souls, when they have
10549:  shown that there is no contradiction in their hypotheses on this
10550:  subject. Such are those who affirm the possibility of thought—of which
10551:  they have no other knowledge than what they derive from its use in
10552:  connecting empirical intuitions presented in this our human life—after
10553:  this life has ceased. But it is very easy to embarrass them by the
10554:  introduction of counter-possibilities, which rest upon quite as good a
10555:  foundation. Such, for example, is the possibility of the division of a
10556:  simple substance into several substances; and conversely, of the
10557:  coalition of several into one simple substance. For, although
10558:  divisibility presupposes composition, it does not necessarily require
10559:  a composition of substances, but only of the degrees (of the several
10560:  faculties) of one and the same substance. Now we can cogitate all the
10561:  powers and faculties of the soul—even that of consciousness—as
10562:  diminished by one half, the substance still remaining. In the same way
10563:  we can represent to ourselves without contradiction, this obliterated
10564:  half as preserved, not in the soul, but without it; and we can believe
10565:  that, as in this case every thing that is real in the soul, and has a
10566:  degree—consequently its entire existence—has been halved, a particular
10567:  substance would arise out of the soul. For the multiplicity, which has
10568:  been divided, formerly existed, but not as a multiplicity of
10569:  substances, but of every reality as the quantum of existence in it;
10570:  and the unity of substance was merely a mode of existence, which by
10571:  this division alone has been transformed into a plurality of
10572:  subsistence. In the same manner several simple substances might
10573:  coalesce into one, without anything being lost except the plurality of
10574:  subsistence, inasmuch as the one substance would contain the degree of
10575:  reality of all the former substances. Perhaps, indeed, the simple
10576:  substances, which appear under the form of matter, might (not indeed
10577:  by a mechanical or chemical influence upon each other, but by an
10578:  unknown influence, of which the former would be but the phenomenal
10579:  appearance), by means of such a dynamical division of the
10580:  parent-souls, as intensive quantities, produce other souls, while the
10581:  former repaired the loss thus sustained with new matter of the same
10582:  sort. I am far from allowing any value to such chimeras; and the
10583:  principles of our analytic have clearly proved that no other than an
10584:  empirical use of the categories—that of substance, for example—is
10585:  possible. But if the rationalist is bold enough to construct, on the
10586:  mere authority of the faculty of thought—without any intuition,
10587:  whereby an object is given—a self-subsistent being, merely because the
10588:  unity of apperception in thought cannot allow him to believe it a
10589:  composite being, instead of declaring, as he ought to do, that he is
10590:  unable to explain the possibility of a thinking nature; what ought to
10591:  hinder the materialist, with as complete an independence of
10592:  experience, to employ the principle of the rationalist in a directly
10593:  opposite manner—still preserving the formal unity required by his
10594:  opponent?
10595: 
10596: 
10597: If, now, we take the above propositions—as they must be accepted as
10598: valid for all thinking beings in the system of rational psychology—in
10599: synthetical connection, and proceed, from the category of relation,
10600: with the proposition: “All thinking beings are, as such, substances,”
10601: backwards through the series, till the circle is completed; we come at
10602: last to their existence, of which, in this system of rational
10603: psychology, substances are held to be conscious, independently of
10604: external things; nay, it is asserted that, in relation to the
10605: permanence which is a necessary characteristic of substance, they can
10606: of themselves determine external things. It follows that idealism—at
10607: least problematical idealism, is perfectly unavoidable in this
10608: rationalistic system. And, if the existence of outward things is not
10609: held to be requisite to the determination of the existence of a
10610: substance in time, the existence of these outward things at all, is a
10611: gratuitous assumption which remains without the possibility of a proof.
10612: 
10613: But if we proceed analytically—the “I think” as a proposition
10614: containing in itself an existence as given, consequently modality being
10615: the principle—and dissect this proposition, in order to ascertain its
10616: content, and discover whether and how this Ego determines its existence
10617: in time and space without the aid of anything external; the
10618: propositions of rationalistic psychology would not begin with the
10619: conception of a thinking being, but with a reality, and the properties
10620: of a thinking being in general would be deduced from the mode in which
10621: this reality is cogitated, after everything empirical had been
10622: abstracted; as is shown in the following table:
10623: 
10624:                         1
10625:                       I think,
10626: 
10627:             2                             3
10628:         as Subject,              as simple Subject,
10629: 
10630:                         4
10631:                as identical Subject,
10632:            in every state of my thought.
10633: 
10634: Now, inasmuch as it is not determined in this second proposition,
10635: whether I can exist and be cogitated only as subject, and not also as a
10636: predicate of another being, the conception of a subject is here taken
10637: in a merely logical sense; and it remains undetermined, whether
10638: substance is to be cogitated under the conception or not. But in the
10639: third proposition, the absolute unity of apperception—the simple Ego in
10640: the representation to which all connection and separation, which
10641: constitute thought, relate, is of itself important; even although it
10642: presents us with no information about the constitution or subsistence
10643: of the subject. Apperception is something real, and the simplicity of
10644: its nature is given in the very fact of its possibility. Now in space
10645: there is nothing real that is at the same time simple; for points,
10646: which are the only simple things in space, are merely limits, but not
10647: constituent parts of space. From this follows the impossibility of a
10648: definition on the basis of materialism of the constitution of my Ego as
10649: a merely thinking subject. But, because my existence is considered in
10650: the first proposition as given, for it does not mean, “Every thinking
10651: being exists” (for this would be predicating of them absolute
10652: necessity), but only, “I exist thinking”; the proposition is quite
10653: empirical, and contains the determinability of my existence merely in
10654: relation to my representations in time. But as I require for this
10655: purpose something that is permanent, such as is not given in internal
10656: intuition; the mode of my existence, whether as substance or as
10657: accident, cannot be determined by means of this simple
10658: self-consciousness. Thus, if materialism is inadequate to explain the
10659: mode in which I exist, spiritualism is likewise as insufficient; and
10660: the conclusion is that we are utterly unable to attain to any knowledge
10661: of the constitution of the soul, in so far as relates to the
10662: possibility of its existence apart from external objects.
10663: 
10664: And, indeed, how should it be possible, merely by the aid of the unity
10665: of consciousness—which we cognize only for the reason that it is
10666: indispensable to the possibility of experience—to pass the bounds of
10667: experience (our existence in this life); and to extend our cognition to
10668: the nature of all thinking beings by means of the empirical—but in
10669: relation to every sort of intuition, perfectly
10670: undetermined—proposition, “I think”?
10671: 
10672: There does not then exist any rational psychology as a doctrine
10673: furnishing any addition to our knowledge of ourselves. It is nothing
10674: more than a discipline, which sets impassable limits to speculative
10675: reason in this region of thought, to prevent it, on the one hand, from
10676: throwing itself into the arms of a soulless materialism, and, on the
10677: other, from losing itself in the mazes of a baseless spiritualism. It
10678: teaches us to consider this refusal of our reason to give any
10679: satisfactory answer to questions which reach beyond the limits of this
10680: our human life, as a hint to abandon fruitless speculation; and to
10681: direct, to a practical use, our knowledge of ourselves—which, although
10682: applicable only to objects of experience, receives its principles from
10683: a higher source, and regulates its procedure as if our destiny reached
10684: far beyond the boundaries of experience and life.
10685: 
10686: From all this it is evident that rational psychology has its origin in
10687: a mere misunderstanding. The unity of consciousness, which lies at the
10688: basis of the categories, is considered to be an intuition of the
10689: subject as an object; and the category of substance is applied to the
10690: intuition. But this unity is nothing more than the unity in thought, by
10691: which no object is given; to which therefore the category of
10692: substance—which always presupposes a given intuition—cannot be applied.
10693: Consequently, the subject cannot be cognized. The subject of the
10694: categories cannot, therefore, for the very reason that it cogitates
10695: these, frame any conception of itself as an object of the categories;
10696: for, to cogitate these, it must lay at the foundation its own pure
10697: self-consciousness—the very thing that it wishes to explain and
10698: describe. In like manner, the subject, in which the representation of
10699: time has its basis, cannot determine, for this very reason, its own
10700: existence in time. Now, if the latter is impossible, the former, as an
10701: attempt to determine itself by means of the categories as a thinking
10702: being in general, is no less so.[47]
10703: 
10704:  [47] The “I think” is, as has been already stated, an empirical
10705:  proposition, and contains the proposition, “I exist.” But I cannot
10706:  say, “Everything, which thinks, exists”; for in this case the property
10707:  of thought would constitute all beings possessing it, necessary
10708:  beings. Hence my existence cannot be considered as an inference from
10709:  the proposition, “I think,” as Descartes maintained—because in this
10710:  case the major premiss, “Everything, which thinks, exists,” must
10711:  precede—but the two propositions are identical. The proposition, “I
10712:  think,” expresses an undetermined empirical intuition, that perception
10713:  (proving consequently that sensation, which must belong to
10714:  sensibility, lies at the foundation of this proposition); but it
10715:  precedes experience, whose province it is to determine an object of
10716:  perception by means of the categories in relation to time; and
10717:  existence in this proposition is not a category, as it does not apply
10718:  to an undetermined given object, but only to one of which we have a
10719:  conception, and about which we wish to know whether it does or does
10720:  not exist, out of, and apart from this conception. An undetermined
10721:  perception signifies here merely something real that has been given,
10722:  only, however, to thought in general—but not as a phenomenon, nor as a
10723:  thing in itself (noumenon), but only as something that really exists,
10724:  and is designated as such in the proposition, “I think.” For it must
10725:  be remarked that, when I call the proposition, “I think,” an empirical
10726:  proposition, I do not thereby mean that the Ego in the proposition is
10727:  an empirical representation; on the contrary, it is purely
10728:  intellectual, because it belongs to thought in general. But without
10729:  some empirical representation, which presents to the mind material for
10730:  thought, the mental act, “I think,” would not take place; and the
10731:  empirical is only the condition of the application or employment of
10732:  the pure intellectual faculty.
10733: 
10734: 
10735: Thus, then, appears the vanity of the hope of establishing a cognition
10736: which is to extend its rule beyond the limits of experience—a cognition
10737: which is one of the highest interests of humanity; and thus is proved
10738: the futility of the attempt of speculative philosophy in this region of
10739: thought. But, in this interest of thought, the severity of criticism
10740: has rendered to reason a not unimportant service, by the demonstration
10741: of the impossibility of making any dogmatical affirmation concerning an
10742: object of experience beyond the boundaries of experience. She has thus
10743: fortified reason against all affirmations of the contrary. Now, this
10744: can be accomplished in only two ways. Either our proposition must be
10745: proved apodeictically; or, if this is unsuccessful, the sources of this
10746: inability must be sought for, and, if these are discovered to exist in
10747: the natural and necessary limitation of our reason, our opponents must
10748: submit to the same law of renunciation and refrain from advancing
10749: claims to dogmatic assertion.
10750: 
10751: But the right, say rather the necessity to admit a future life, upon
10752: principles of the practical conjoined with the speculative use of
10753: reason, has lost nothing by this renunciation; for the merely
10754: speculative proof has never had any influence upon the common reason of
10755: men. It stands upon the point of a hair, so that even the schools have
10756: been able to preserve it from falling only by incessantly discussing it
10757: and spinning it like a top; and even in their eyes it has never been
10758: able to present any safe foundation for the erection of a theory. The
10759: proofs which have been current among men, preserve their value
10760: undiminished; nay, rather gain in clearness and unsophisticated power,
10761: by the rejection of the dogmatical assumptions of speculative reason.
10762: For reason is thus confined within her own peculiar province—the
10763: arrangement of ends or aims, which is at the same time the arrangement
10764: of nature; and, as a practical faculty, without limiting itself to the
10765: latter, it is justified in extending the former, and with it our own
10766: existence, beyond the boundaries of experience and life. If we turn our
10767: attention to the analogy of the nature of living beings in this world,
10768: in the consideration of which reason is obliged to accept as a
10769: principle that no organ, no faculty, no appetite is useless, and that
10770: nothing is superfluous, nothing disproportionate to its use, nothing
10771: unsuited to its end; but that, on the contrary, everything is perfectly
10772: conformed to its destination in life—we shall find that man, who alone
10773: is the final end and aim of this order, is still the only animal that
10774: seems to be excepted from it. For his natural gifts—not merely as
10775: regards the talents and motives that may incite him to employ them, but
10776: especially the moral law in him—stretch so far beyond all mere earthly
10777: utility and advantage, that he feels himself bound to prize the mere
10778: consciousness of probity, apart from all advantageous consequences—even
10779: the shadowy gift of posthumous fame—above everything; and he is
10780: conscious of an inward call to constitute himself, by his conduct in
10781: this world—without regard to mere sublunary interests—the citizen of a
10782: better. This mighty, irresistible proof—accompanied by an
10783: ever-increasing knowledge of the conformability to a purpose in
10784: everything we see around us, by the conviction of the boundless
10785: immensity of creation, by the consciousness of a certain
10786: illimitableness in the possible extension of our knowledge, and by a
10787: desire commensurate therewith—remains to humanity, even after the
10788: theoretical cognition of ourselves has failed to establish the
10789: necessity of an existence after death.
10790: 
10791: Conclusion of the Solution of the Psychological Paralogism.
10792: 
10793: 
10794: The dialectical illusion in rational psychology arises from our
10795: confounding an idea of reason (of a pure intelligence) with the
10796: conception—in every respect undetermined—of a thinking being in
10797: general. I cogitate myself in behalf of a possible experience, at the
10798: same time making abstraction of all actual experience; and infer
10799: therefrom that I can be conscious of myself apart from experience and
10800: its empirical conditions. I consequently confound the possible
10801: abstraction of my empirically determined existence with the supposed
10802: consciousness of a possible separate existence of my thinking self; and
10803: I believe that I cognize what is substantial in myself as a
10804: transcendental subject, when I have nothing more in thought than the
10805: unity of consciousness, which lies at the basis of all determination of
10806: cognition.
10807: 
10808: The task of explaining the community of the soul with the body does not
10809: properly belong to the psychology of which we are here speaking;
10810: because it proposes to prove the personality of the soul apart from
10811: this communion (after death), and is therefore transcendent in the
10812: proper sense of the word, although occupying itself with an object of
10813: experience—only in so far, however, as it ceases to be an object of
10814: experience. But a sufficient answer may be found to the question in our
10815: system. The difficulty which lies in the execution of this task
10816: consists, as is well known, in the presupposed heterogeneity of the
10817: object of the internal sense (the soul) and the objects of the external
10818: senses; inasmuch as the formal condition of the intuition of the one is
10819: time, and of that of the other space also. But if we consider that both
10820: kinds of objects do not differ internally, but only in so far as the
10821: one appears externally to the other—consequently, that what lies at the
10822: basis of phenomena, as a thing in itself, may not be heterogeneous;
10823: this difficulty disappears. There then remains no other difficulty than
10824: is to be found in the question—how a community of substances is
10825: possible; a question which lies out of the region of psychology, and
10826: which the reader, after what in our analytic has been said of primitive
10827: forces and faculties, will easily judge to be also beyond the region of
10828: human cognition.
10829: 
10830: GENERAL REMARK
10831: 
10832: On the Transition from Rational Psychology to Cosmology.
10833: 
10834: The proposition, “I think,” or, “I exist thinking,” is an empirical
10835: proposition. But such a proposition must be based on empirical
10836: intuition, and the object cogitated as a phenomenon; and thus our
10837: theory appears to maintain that the soul, even in thought, is merely a
10838: phenomenon; and in this way our consciousness itself, in fact, abuts
10839: upon nothing.
10840: 
10841: Thought, per se, is merely the purely spontaneous logical function
10842: which operates to connect the manifold of a possible intuition; and it
10843: does not represent the subject of consciousness as a phenomenon—for
10844: this reason alone, that it pays no attention to the question whether
10845: the mode of intuiting it is sensuous or intellectual. I therefore do
10846: not represent myself in thought either as I am, or as I appear to
10847: myself; I merely cogitate myself as an object in general, of the mode
10848: of intuiting which I make abstraction. When I represent myself as the
10849: subject of thought, or as the ground of thought, these modes of
10850: representation are not related to the categories of substance or of
10851: cause; for these are functions of thought applicable only to our
10852: sensuous intuition. The application of these categories to the Ego
10853: would, however, be necessary, if I wished to make myself an object of
10854: knowledge. But I wish to be conscious of myself only as thinking; in
10855: what mode my Self is given in intuition, I do not consider, and it may
10856: be that I, who think, am a phenomenon—although not in so far as I am a
10857: thinking being; but in the consciousness of myself in mere thought I am
10858: a being, though this consciousness does not present to me any property
10859: of this being as material for thought.
10860: 
10861: But the proposition, “I think,” in so far as it declares, “I exist
10862: thinking,” is not the mere representation of a logical function. It
10863: determines the subject (which is in this case an object also) in
10864: relation to existence; and it cannot be given without the aid of the
10865: internal sense, whose intuition presents to us an object, not as a
10866: thing in itself, but always as a phenomenon. In this proposition there
10867: is therefore something more to be found than the mere spontaneity of
10868: thought; there is also the receptivity of intuition, that is, my
10869: thought of myself applied to the empirical intuition of myself. Now, in
10870: this intuition the thinking self must seek the conditions of the
10871: employment of its logical functions as categories of substance, cause,
10872: and so forth; not merely for the purpose of distinguishing itself as an
10873: object in itself by means of the representation “I,” but also for the
10874: purpose of determining the mode of its existence, that is, of cognizing
10875: itself as noumenon. But this is impossible, for the internal empirical
10876: intuition is sensuous, and presents us with nothing but phenomenal
10877: data, which do not assist the object of pure consciousness in its
10878: attempt to cognize itself as a separate existence, but are useful only
10879: as contributions to experience.
10880: 
10881: But, let it be granted that we could discover, not in experience, but
10882: in certain firmly-established à priori laws of the use of pure
10883: reason—laws relating to our existence, authority to consider ourselves
10884: as legislating à priori in relation to our own existence and as
10885: determining this existence; we should, on this supposition, find
10886: ourselves possessed of a spontaneity, by which our actual existence
10887: would be determinable, without the aid of the conditions of empirical
10888: intuition. We should also become aware that in the consciousness of our
10889: existence there was an à priori content, which would serve to determine
10890: our own existence—an existence only sensuously determinable—relatively,
10891: however, to a certain internal faculty in relation to an intelligible
10892: world.
10893: 
10894: But this would not give the least help to the attempts of rational
10895: psychology. For this wonderful faculty, which the consciousness of the
10896: moral law in me reveals, would present me with a principle of the
10897: determination of my own existence which is purely intellectual—but by
10898: what predicates? By none other than those which are given in sensuous
10899: intuition. Thus I should find myself in the same position in rational
10900: psychology which I formerly occupied, that is to say, I should find
10901: myself still in need of sensuous intuitions, in order to give
10902: significance to my conceptions of substance and cause, by means of
10903: which alone I can possess a knowledge of myself: but these intuitions
10904: can never raise me above the sphere of experience. I should be
10905: justified, however, in applying these conceptions, in regard to their
10906: practical use, which is always directed to objects of experience—in
10907: conformity with their analogical significance when employed
10908: theoretically—to freedom and its subject. At the same time, I should
10909: understand by them merely the logical functions of subject and
10910: predicate, of principle and consequence, in conformity with which all
10911: actions are so determined, that they are capable of being explained
10912: along with the laws of nature, conformably to the categories of
10913: substance and cause, although they originate from a very different
10914: principle. We have made these observations for the purpose of guarding
10915: against misunderstanding, to which the doctrine of our intuition of
10916: self as a phenomenon is exposed. We shall have occasion to perceive
10917: their utility in the sequel.
10918: 
10919: Chapter II. The Antinomy of Pure Reason
10920: 
10921: We showed in the introduction to this part of our work, that all
10922: transcendental illusion of pure reason arose from dialectical
10923: arguments, the schema of which logic gives us in its three formal
10924: species of syllogisms—just as the categories find their logical schema
10925: in the four functions of all judgements. The first kind of these
10926: sophistical arguments related to the unconditioned unity of the
10927: subjective conditions of all representations in general (of the subject
10928: or soul), in correspondence with the categorical syllogisms, the major
10929: of which, as the principle, enounces the relation of a predicate to a
10930: subject. The second kind of dialectical argument will therefore be
10931: concerned, following the analogy with hypothetical syllogisms, with the
10932: unconditioned unity of the objective conditions in the phenomenon; and,
10933: in this way, the theme of the third kind to be treated of in the
10934: following chapter will be the unconditioned unity of the objective
10935: conditions of the possibility of objects in general.
10936: 
10937: But it is worthy of remark that the transcendental paralogism produced
10938: in the mind only a one-third illusion, in regard to the idea of the
10939: subject of our thought; and the conceptions of reason gave no ground to
10940: maintain the contrary proposition. The advantage is completely on the
10941: side of Pneumatism; although this theory itself passes into naught, in
10942: the crucible of pure reason.
10943: 
10944: Very different is the case when we apply reason to the objective
10945: synthesis of phenomena. Here, certainly, reason establishes, with much
10946: plausibility, its principle of unconditioned unity; but it very soon
10947: falls into such contradictions that it is compelled, in relation to
10948: cosmology, to renounce its pretensions.
10949: 
10950: For here a new phenomenon of human reason meets us—a perfectly natural
10951: antithetic, which does not require to be sought for by subtle
10952: sophistry, but into which reason of itself unavoidably falls. It is
10953: thereby preserved, to be sure, from the slumber of a fancied
10954: conviction—which a merely one-sided illusion produces; but it is at the
10955: same time compelled, either, on the one hand, to abandon itself to a
10956: despairing scepticism, or, on the other, to assume a dogmatical
10957: confidence and obstinate persistence in certain assertions, without
10958: granting a fair hearing to the other side of the question. Either is
10959: the death of a sound philosophy, although the former might perhaps
10960: deserve the title of the euthanasia of pure reason.
10961: 
10962: Before entering this region of discord and confusion, which the
10963: conflict of the laws of pure reason (antinomy) produces, we shall
10964: present the reader with some considerations, in explanation and
10965: justification of the method we intend to follow in our treatment of
10966: this subject. I term all transcendental ideas, in so far as they relate
10967: to the absolute totality in the synthesis of phenomena, cosmical
10968: conceptions; partly on account of this unconditioned totality, on which
10969: the conception of the world-whole is based—a conception, which is
10970: itself an idea—partly because they relate solely to the synthesis of
10971: phenomena—the empirical synthesis; while, on the other hand, the
10972: absolute totality in the synthesis of the conditions of all possible
10973: things gives rise to an ideal of pure reason, which is quite distinct
10974: from the cosmical conception, although it stands in relation with it.
10975: Hence, as the paralogisms of pure reason laid the foundation for a
10976: dialectical psychology, the antinomy of pure reason will present us
10977: with the transcendental principles of a pretended pure (rational)
10978: cosmology—not, however, to declare it valid and to appropriate it,
10979: but—as the very term of a conflict of reason sufficiently indicates, to
10980: present it as an idea which cannot be reconciled with phenomena and
10981: experience.
10982: 
10983: Section I. System of Cosmological Ideas
10984: 
10985: That We may be able to enumerate with systematic precision these ideas
10986: according to a principle, we must remark, in the first place, that it
10987: is from the understanding alone that pure and transcendental
10988: conceptions take their origin; that the reason does not properly give
10989: birth to any conception, but only frees the conception of the
10990: understanding from the unavoidable limitation of a possible experience,
10991: and thus endeavours to raise it above the empirical, though it must
10992: still be in connection with it. This happens from the fact that, for a
10993: given conditioned, reason demands absolute totality on the side of the
10994: conditions (to which the understanding submits all phenomena), and thus
10995: makes of the category a transcendental idea. This it does that it may
10996: be able to give absolute completeness to the empirical synthesis, by
10997: continuing it to the unconditioned (which is not to be found in
10998: experience, but only in the idea). Reason requires this according to
10999: the principle: If the conditioned is given the whole of the conditions,
11000: and consequently the absolutely unconditioned, is also given, whereby
11001: alone the former was possible. First, then, the transcendental ideas
11002: are properly nothing but categories elevated to the unconditioned; and
11003: they may be arranged in a table according to the titles of the latter.
11004: But, secondly, all the categories are not available for this purpose,
11005: but only those in which the synthesis constitutes a series—of
11006: conditions subordinated to, not co-ordinated with, each other. Absolute
11007: totality is required of reason only in so far as concerns the ascending
11008: series of the conditions of a conditioned; not, consequently, when the
11009: question relates to the descending series of consequences, or to the
11010: aggregate of the co-ordinated conditions of these consequences. For, in
11011: relation to a given conditioned, conditions are presupposed and
11012: considered to be given along with it. On the other hand, as the
11013: consequences do not render possible their conditions, but rather
11014: presuppose them—in the consideration of the procession of consequences
11015: (or in the descent from the given condition to the conditioned), we may
11016: be quite unconcerned whether the series ceases or not; and their
11017: totality is not a necessary demand of reason.
11018: 
11019: Thus we cogitate—and necessarily—a given time completely elapsed up to
11020: a given moment, although that time is not determinable by us. But as
11021: regards time future, which is not the condition of arriving at the
11022: present, in order to conceive it; it is quite indifferent whether we
11023: consider future time as ceasing at some point, or as prolonging itself
11024: to infinity. Take, for example, the series m, n, o, in which n is given
11025: as conditioned in relation to m, but at the same time as the condition
11026: of o, and let the series proceed upwards from the conditioned n to m
11027: (l, k, i, etc.), and also downwards from the condition n to the
11028: conditioned o (p, q, r, etc.)—I must presuppose the former series, to
11029: be able to consider n as given, and n is according to reason (the
11030: totality of conditions) possible only by means of that series. But its
11031: possibility does not rest on the following series o, p, q, r, which for
11032: this reason cannot be regarded as given, but only as capable of being
11033: given (dabilis).
11034: 
11035: I shall term the synthesis of the series on the side of the
11036: conditions—from that nearest to the given phenomenon up to the more
11037: remote—regressive; that which proceeds on the side of the conditioned,
11038: from the immediate consequence to the more remote, I shall call the
11039: progressive synthesis. The former proceeds in antecedentia, the latter
11040: in consequentia. The cosmological ideas are therefore occupied with the
11041: totality of the regressive synthesis, and proceed in antecedentia, not
11042: in consequentia. When the latter takes place, it is an arbitrary and
11043: not a necessary problem of pure reason; for we require, for the
11044: complete understanding of what is given in a phenomenon, not the
11045: consequences which succeed, but the grounds or principles which
11046: precede.
11047: 
11048: In order to construct the table of ideas in correspondence with the
11049: table of categories, we take first the two primitive quanta of all our
11050: intuitions, time and space. Time is in itself a series (and the formal
11051: condition of all series), and hence, in relation to a given present, we
11052: must distinguish à priori in it the antecedentia as conditions (time
11053: past) from the consequentia (time future). Consequently, the
11054: transcendental idea of the absolute totality of the series of the
11055: conditions of a given conditioned, relates merely to all past time.
11056: According to the idea of reason, the whole past time, as the condition
11057: of the given moment, is necessarily cogitated as given. But, as regards
11058: space, there exists in it no distinction between progressus and
11059: regressus; for it is an aggregate and not a series—its parts existing
11060: together at the same time. I can consider a given point of time in
11061: relation to past time only as conditioned, because this given moment
11062: comes into existence only through the past time rather through the
11063: passing of the preceding time. But as the parts of space are not
11064: subordinated, but co-ordinated to each other, one part cannot be the
11065: condition of the possibility of the other; and space is not in itself,
11066: like time, a series. But the synthesis of the manifold parts of
11067: space—(the syntheses whereby we apprehend space)—is nevertheless
11068: successive; it takes place, therefore, in time, and contains a series.
11069: And as in this series of aggregated spaces (for example, the feet in a
11070: rood), beginning with a given portion of space, those which continue to
11071: be annexed form the condition of the limits of the former—the
11072: measurement of a space must also be regarded as a synthesis of the
11073: series of the conditions of a given conditioned. It differs, however,
11074: in this respect from that of time, that the side of the conditioned is
11075: not in itself distinguishable from the side of the condition; and,
11076: consequently, regressus and progressus in space seem to be identical.
11077: But, inasmuch as one part of space is not given, but only limited, by
11078: and through another, we must also consider every limited space as
11079: conditioned, in so far as it presupposes some other space as the
11080: condition of its limitation, and so on. As regards limitation,
11081: therefore, our procedure in space is also a regressus, and the
11082: transcendental idea of the absolute totality of the synthesis in a
11083: series of conditions applies to space also; and I am entitled to demand
11084: the absolute totality of the phenomenal synthesis in space as well as
11085: in time. Whether my demand can be satisfied is a question to be
11086: answered in the sequel.
11087: 
11088: Secondly, the real in space—that is, matter—is conditioned. Its
11089: internal conditions are its parts, and the parts of parts its remote
11090: conditions; so that in this case we find a regressive synthesis, the
11091: absolute totality of which is a demand of reason. But this cannot be
11092: obtained otherwise than by a complete division of parts, whereby the
11093: real in matter becomes either nothing or that which is not matter, that
11094: is to say, the simple. Consequently we find here also a series of
11095: conditions and a progress to the unconditioned.
11096: 
11097: Thirdly, as regards the categories of a real relation between
11098: phenomena, the category of substance and its accidents is not suitable
11099: for the formation of a transcendental idea; that is to say, reason has
11100: no ground, in regard to it, to proceed regressively with conditions.
11101: For accidents (in so far as they inhere in a substance) are
11102: co-ordinated with each other, and do not constitute a series. And, in
11103: relation to substance, they are not properly subordinated to it, but
11104: are the mode of existence of the substance itself. The conception of
11105: the substantial might nevertheless seem to be an idea of the
11106: transcendental reason. But, as this signifies nothing more than the
11107: conception of an object in general, which subsists in so far as we
11108: cogitate in it merely a transcendental subject without any predicates;
11109: and as the question here is of an unconditioned in the series of
11110: phenomena—it is clear that the substantial can form no member thereof.
11111: The same holds good of substances in community, which are mere
11112: aggregates and do not form a series. For they are not subordinated to
11113: each other as conditions of the possibility of each other; which,
11114: however, may be affirmed of spaces, the limits of which are never
11115: determined in themselves, but always by some other space. It is,
11116: therefore, only in the category of causality that we can find a series
11117: of causes to a given effect, and in which we ascend from the latter, as
11118: the conditioned, to the former as the conditions, and thus answer the
11119: question of reason.
11120: 
11121: Fourthly, the conceptions of the possible, the actual, and the
11122: necessary do not conduct us to any series—excepting only in so far as
11123: the contingent in existence must always be regarded as conditioned, and
11124: as indicating, according to a law of the understanding, a condition,
11125: under which it is necessary to rise to a higher, till in the totality
11126: of the series, reason arrives at unconditioned necessity.
11127: 
11128: There are, accordingly, only four cosmological ideas, corresponding
11129: with the four titles of the categories. For we can select only such as
11130: necessarily furnish us with a series in the synthesis of the manifold.
11131: 
11132:                       1
11133:             The absolute Completeness
11134:                     of the
11135:                  COMPOSITION
11136:      of the given totality of all phenomena.
11137: 
11138:                       2
11139:             The absolute Completeness
11140:                     of the
11141:                    DIVISION
11142:      of given totality in a phenomenon.
11143: 
11144:                        3
11145:             The absolute Completeness
11146:                      of the
11147:                    ORIGINATION
11148:                   of a phenomenon.
11149: 
11150:                        4
11151:             The absolute Completeness
11152:          of the DEPENDENCE of the EXISTENCE
11153:         of what is changeable in a phenomenon.
11154: 
11155: We must here remark, in the first place, that the idea of absolute
11156: totality relates to nothing but the exposition of phenomena, and
11157: therefore not to the pure conception of a totality of things. Phenomena
11158: are here, therefore, regarded as given, and reason requires the
11159: absolute completeness of the conditions of their possibility, in so far
11160: as these conditions constitute a series—consequently an absolutely
11161: (that is, in every respect) complete synthesis, whereby a phenomenon
11162: can be explained according to the laws of the understanding.
11163: 
11164: Secondly, it is properly the unconditioned alone that reason seeks in
11165: this serially and regressively conducted synthesis of conditions. It
11166: wishes, to speak in another way, to attain to completeness in the
11167: series of premisses, so as to render it unnecessary to presuppose
11168: others. This unconditioned is always contained in the absolute totality
11169: of the series, when we endeavour to form a representation of it in
11170: thought. But this absolutely complete synthesis is itself but an idea;
11171: for it is impossible, at least before hand, to know whether any such
11172: synthesis is possible in the case of phenomena. When we represent all
11173: existence in thought by means of pure conceptions of the understanding,
11174: without any conditions of sensuous intuition, we may say with justice
11175: that for a given conditioned the whole series of conditions
11176: subordinated to each other is also given; for the former is only given
11177: through the latter. But we find in the case of phenomena a particular
11178: limitation of the mode in which conditions are given, that is, through
11179: the successive synthesis of the manifold of intuition, which must be
11180: complete in the regress. Now whether this completeness is sensuously
11181: possible, is a problem. But the idea of it lies in the reason—be it
11182: possible or impossible to connect with the idea adequate empirical
11183: conceptions. Therefore, as in the absolute totality of the regressive
11184: synthesis of the manifold in a phenomenon (following the guidance of
11185: the categories, which represent it as a series of conditions to a given
11186: conditioned) the unconditioned is necessarily contained—it being still
11187: left unascertained whether and how this totality exists; reason sets
11188: out from the idea of totality, although its proper and final aim is the
11189: unconditioned—of the whole series, or of a part thereof.
11190: 
11191: This unconditioned may be cogitated—either as existing only in the
11192: entire series, all the members of which therefore would be without
11193: exception conditioned and only the totality absolutely
11194: unconditioned—and in this case the regressus is called infinite; or the
11195: absolutely unconditioned is only a part of the series, to which the
11196: other members are subordinated, but which Is not itself submitted to
11197: any other condition.[48] In the former case the series is a parte
11198: priori unlimited (without beginning), that is, infinite, and
11199: nevertheless completely given. But the regress in it is never
11200: completed, and can only be called potentially infinite. In the second
11201: case there exists a first in the series. This first is called, in
11202: relation to past time, the beginning of the world; in relation to
11203: space, the limit of the world; in relation to the parts of a given
11204: limited whole, the simple; in relation to causes, absolute spontaneity
11205: (liberty); and in relation to the existence of changeable things,
11206: absolute physical necessity.
11207: 
11208:  [48] The absolute totality of the series of conditions to a given
11209:  conditioned is always unconditioned; because beyond it there exist no
11210:  other conditions, on which it might depend. But the absolute totality
11211:  of such a series is only an idea, or rather a problematical
11212:  conception, the possibility of which must be investigated—particularly
11213:  in relation to the mode in which the unconditioned, as the
11214:  transcendental idea which is the real subject of inquiry, may be
11215:  contained therein.
11216: 
11217: 
11218: We possess two expressions, world and nature, which are generally
11219: interchanged. The first denotes the mathematical total of all phenomena
11220: and the totality of their synthesis—in its progress by means of
11221: composition, as well as by division. And the world is termed
11222: nature,[49] when it is regarded as a dynamical whole—when our attention
11223: is not directed to the aggregation in space and time, for the purpose
11224: of cogitating it as a quantity, but to the unity in the existence of
11225: phenomena. In this case the condition of that which happens is called a
11226: cause; the unconditioned causality of the cause in a phenomenon is
11227: termed liberty; the conditioned cause is called in a more limited sense
11228: a natural cause. The conditioned in existence is termed contingent, and
11229: the unconditioned necessary. The unconditioned necessity of phenomena
11230: may be called natural necessity.
11231: 
11232:  [49] Nature, understood adjective (formaliter), signifies the complex
11233:  of the determinations of a thing, connected according to an internal
11234:  principle of causality. On the other hand, we understand by nature,
11235:  substantive (materialiter), the sum total of phenomena, in so far as
11236:  they, by virtue of an internal principle of causality, are connected
11237:  with each other throughout. In the former sense we speak of the nature
11238:  of liquid matter, of fire, etc., and employ the word only adjective;
11239:  while, if speaking of the objects of nature, we have in our minds the
11240:  idea of a subsisting whole.
11241: 
11242: 
11243: The ideas which we are at present engaged in discussing I have called
11244: cosmological ideas; partly because by the term world is understood the
11245: entire content of all phenomena, and our ideas are directed solely to
11246: the unconditioned among phenomena; partly also, because world, in the
11247: transcendental sense, signifies the absolute totality of the content of
11248: existing things, and we are directing our attention only to the
11249: completeness of the synthesis—although, properly, only in regression.
11250: In regard to the fact that these ideas are all transcendent, and,
11251: although they do not transcend phenomena as regards their mode, but are
11252: concerned solely with the world of sense (and not with noumena),
11253: nevertheless carry their synthesis to a degree far above all possible
11254: experience—it still seems to me that we can, with perfect propriety,
11255: designate them cosmical conceptions. As regards the distinction between
11256: the mathematically and the dynamically unconditioned which is the aim
11257: of the regression of the synthesis, I should call the two former, in a
11258: more limited signification, cosmical conceptions, the remaining two
11259: transcendent physical conceptions. This distinction does not at present
11260: seem to be of particular importance, but we shall afterwards find it to
11261: be of some value.
11262: 
11263: Section II. Antithetic of Pure Reason
11264: 
11265: Thetic is the term applied to every collection of dogmatical
11266: propositions. By antithetic I do not understand dogmatical assertions
11267: of the opposite, but the self-contradiction of seemingly dogmatical
11268: cognitions (thesis cum antithesis), in none of which we can discover
11269: any decided superiority. Antithetic is not, therefore, occupied with
11270: one-sided statements, but is engaged in considering the contradictory
11271: nature of the general cognitions of reason and its causes.
11272: Transcendental antithetic is an investigation into the antinomy of pure
11273: reason, its causes and result. If we employ our reason not merely in
11274: the application of the principles of the understanding to objects of
11275: experience, but venture with it beyond these boundaries, there arise
11276: certain sophistical propositions or theorems. These assertions have the
11277: following peculiarities: They can find neither confirmation nor
11278: confutation in experience; and each is in itself not only
11279: self-consistent, but possesses conditions of its necessity in the very
11280: nature of reason—only that, unluckily, there exist just as valid and
11281: necessary grounds for maintaining the contrary proposition.
11282: 
11283: The questions which naturally arise in the consideration of this
11284: dialectic of pure reason, are therefore: 1st. In what propositions is
11285: pure reason unavoidably subject to an antinomy? 2nd. What are the
11286: causes of this antinomy? 3rd. Whether and in what way can reason free
11287: itself from this self-contradiction?
11288: 
11289: A dialectical proposition or theorem of pure reason must, according to
11290: what has been said, be distinguishable from all sophistical
11291: propositions, by the fact that it is not an answer to an arbitrary
11292: question, which may be raised at the mere pleasure of any person, but
11293: to one which human reason must necessarily encounter in its progress.
11294: In the second place, a dialectical proposition, with its opposite, does
11295: not carry the appearance of a merely artificial illusion, which
11296: disappears as soon as it is investigated, but a natural and unavoidable
11297: illusion, which, even when we are no longer deceived by it, continues
11298: to mock us and, although rendered harmless, can never be completely
11299: removed.
11300: 
11301: This dialectical doctrine will not relate to the unity of understanding
11302: in empirical conceptions, but to the unity of reason in pure ideas. The
11303: conditions of this doctrine are—inasmuch as it must, as a synthesis
11304: according to rules, be conformable to the understanding, and at the
11305: same time as the absolute unity of the synthesis, to the reason—that,
11306: if it is adequate to the unity of reason, it is too great for the
11307: understanding, if according with the understanding, it is too small for
11308: the reason. Hence arises a mutual opposition, which cannot be avoided,
11309: do what we will.
11310: 
11311: These sophistical assertions of dialectic open, as it were, a
11312: battle-field, where that side obtains the victory which has been
11313: permitted to make the attack, and he is compelled to yield who has been
11314: unfortunately obliged to stand on the defensive. And hence, champions
11315: of ability, whether on the right or on the wrong side, are certain to
11316: carry away the crown of victory, if they only take care to have the
11317: right to make the last attack, and are not obliged to sustain another
11318: onset from their opponent. We can easily believe that this arena has
11319: been often trampled by the feet of combatants, that many victories have
11320: been obtained on both sides, but that the last victory, decisive of the
11321: affair between the contending parties, was won by him who fought for
11322: the right, only if his adversary was forbidden to continue the tourney.
11323: As impartial umpires, we must lay aside entirely the consideration
11324: whether the combatants are fighting for the right or for the wrong
11325: side, for the true or for the false, and allow the combat to be first
11326: decided. Perhaps, after they have wearied more than injured each other,
11327: they will discover the nothingness of their cause of quarrel and part
11328: good friends.
11329: 
11330: This method of watching, or rather of originating, a conflict of
11331: assertions, not for the purpose of finally deciding in favour of either
11332: side, but to discover whether the object of the struggle is not a mere
11333: illusion, which each strives in vain to reach, but which would be no
11334: gain even when reached—this procedure, I say, may be termed the
11335: sceptical method. It is thoroughly distinct from scepticism—the
11336: principle of a technical and scientific ignorance, which undermines the
11337: foundations of all knowledge, in order, if possible, to destroy our
11338: belief and confidence therein. For the sceptical method aims at
11339: certainty, by endeavouring to discover in a conflict of this kind,
11340: conducted honestly and intelligently on both sides, the point of
11341: misunderstanding; just as wise legislators derive, from the
11342: embarrassment of judges in lawsuits, information in regard to the
11343: defective and ill-defined parts of their statutes. The antinomy which
11344: reveals itself in the application of laws, is for our limited wisdom
11345: the best criterion of legislation. For the attention of reason, which
11346: in abstract speculation does not easily become conscious of its errors,
11347: is thus roused to the momenta in the determination of its principles.
11348: 
11349: But this sceptical method is essentially peculiar to transcendental
11350: philosophy, and can perhaps be dispensed with in every other field of
11351: investigation. In mathematics its use would be absurd; because in it no
11352: false assertions can long remain hidden, inasmuch as its demonstrations
11353: must always proceed under the guidance of pure intuition, and by means
11354: of an always evident synthesis. In experimental philosophy, doubt and
11355: delay may be very useful; but no misunderstanding is possible, which
11356: cannot be easily removed; and in experience means of solving the
11357: difficulty and putting an end to the dissension must at last be found,
11358: whether sooner or later. Moral philosophy can always exhibit its
11359: principles, with their practical consequences, in concreto—at least in
11360: possible experiences, and thus escape the mistakes and ambiguities of
11361: abstraction. But transcendental propositions, which lay claim to
11362: insight beyond the region of possible experience, cannot, on the one
11363: hand, exhibit their abstract synthesis in any à priori intuition, nor,
11364: on the other, expose a lurking error by the help of experience.
11365: Transcendental reason, therefore, presents us with no other criterion
11366: than that of an attempt to reconcile such assertions, and for this
11367: purpose to permit a free and unrestrained conflict between them. And
11368: this we now proceed to arrange.[50]
11369: 
11370:  [50] The antinomies stand in the order of the four transcendental
11371:  ideas above detailed.
11372: 
11373: 
11374: FIRST CONFLICT OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL IDEAS. THESIS.
11375: 
11376: The world has a beginning in time, and is also limited in regard to
11377: space.
11378: 
11379: PROOF.
11380: 
11381: Granted that the world has no beginning in time; up to every given
11382: moment of time, an eternity must have elapsed, and therewith passed
11383: away an infinite series of successive conditions or states of things in
11384: the world. Now the infinity of a series consists in the fact that it
11385: never can be completed by means of a successive synthesis. It follows
11386: that an infinite series already elapsed is impossible and that,
11387: consequently, a beginning of the world is a necessary condition of its
11388: existence. And this was the first thing to be proved.
11389: 
11390: As regards the second, let us take the opposite for granted. In this
11391: case, the world must be an infinite given total of coexistent things.
11392: Now we cannot cogitate the dimensions of a quantity, which is not given
11393: within certain limits of an intuition,[51] in any other way than by
11394: means of the synthesis of its parts, and the total of such a quantity
11395: only by means of a completed synthesis, or the repeated addition of
11396: unity to itself. Accordingly, to cogitate the world, which fills all
11397: spaces, as a whole, the successive synthesis of the parts of an
11398: infinite world must be looked upon as completed, that is to say, an
11399: infinite time must be regarded as having elapsed in the enumeration of
11400: all co-existing things; which is impossible. For this reason an
11401: infinite aggregate of actual things cannot be considered as a given
11402: whole, consequently, not as a contemporaneously given whole. The world
11403: is consequently, as regards extension in space, not infinite, but
11404: enclosed in limits. And this was the second thing to be proved.
11405: 
11406:  [51] We may consider an undetermined quantity as a whole, when it is
11407:  enclosed within limits, although we cannot construct or ascertain its
11408:  totality by measurement, that is, by the successive synthesis of its
11409:  parts. For its limits of themselves determine its completeness as a
11410:  whole.
11411: 
11412: 
11413: ANTITHESIS.
11414: 
11415: The world has no beginning, and no limits in space, but is, in relation
11416: both to time and space, infinite.
11417: 
11418: PROOF.
11419: 
11420: For let it be granted that it has a beginning. A beginning is an
11421: existence which is preceded by a time in which the thing does not
11422: exist. On the above supposition, it follows that there must have been a
11423: time in which the world did not exist, that is, a void time. But in a
11424: void time the origination of a thing is impossible; because no part of
11425: any such time contains a distinctive condition of being, in preference
11426: to that of non-being (whether the supposed thing originate of itself,
11427: or by means of some other cause). Consequently, many series of things
11428: may have a beginning in the world, but the world itself cannot have a
11429: beginning, and is, therefore, in relation to past time, infinite.
11430: 
11431: As regards the second statement, let us first take the opposite for
11432: granted—that the world is finite and limited in space; it follows that
11433: it must exist in a void space, which is not limited. We should
11434: therefore meet not only with a relation of things in space, but also a
11435: relation of things to space. Now, as the world is an absolute whole,
11436: out of and beyond which no object of intuition, and consequently no
11437: correlate to which can be discovered, this relation of the world to a
11438: void space is merely a relation to no object. But such a relation, and
11439: consequently the limitation of the world by void space, is nothing.
11440: Consequently, the world, as regards space, is not limited, that is, it
11441: is infinite in regard to extension.[52]
11442: 
11443:  [52] Space is merely the form of external intuition (formal
11444:  intuition), and not a real object which can be externally perceived.
11445:  Space, prior to all things which determine it (fill or limit it), or,
11446:  rather, which present an empirical intuition conformable to it, is,
11447:  under the title of absolute space, nothing but the mere possibility of
11448:  external phenomena, in so far as they either exist in themselves, or
11449:  can annex themselves to given intuitions. Empirical intuition is
11450:  therefore not a composition of phenomena and space (of perception and
11451:  empty intuition). The one is not the correlate of the other in a
11452:  synthesis, but they are vitally connected in the same empirical
11453:  intuition, as matter and form. If we wish to set one of these two
11454:  apart from the other—space from phenomena—there arise all sorts of
11455:  empty determinations of external intuition, which are very far from
11456:  being possible perceptions. For example, motion or rest of the world
11457:  in an infinite empty space, or a determination of the mutual relation
11458:  of both, cannot possibly be perceived, and is therefore merely the
11459:  predicate of a notional entity.
11460: 
11461: 
11462: OBSERVATIONS ON THE FIRST ANTINOMY. ON THE THESIS.
11463: 
11464: In bringing forward these conflicting arguments, I have not been on the
11465: search for sophisms, for the purpose of availing myself of special
11466: pleading, which takes advantage of the carelessness of the opposite
11467: party, appeals to a misunderstood statute, and erects its unrighteous
11468: claims upon an unfair interpretation. Both proofs originate fairly from
11469: the nature of the case, and the advantage presented by the mistakes of
11470: the dogmatists of both parties has been completely set aside.
11471: 
11472: The thesis might also have been unfairly demonstrated, by the
11473: introduction of an erroneous conception of the infinity of a given
11474: quantity. A quantity is infinite, if a greater than itself cannot
11475: possibly exist. The quantity is measured by the number of given
11476: units—which are taken as a standard—contained in it. Now no number can
11477: be the greatest, because one or more units can always be added. It
11478: follows that an infinite given quantity, consequently an infinite world
11479: (both as regards time and extension) is impossible. It is, therefore,
11480: limited in both respects. In this manner I might have conducted my
11481: proof; but the conception given in it does not agree with the true
11482: conception of an infinite whole. In this there is no representation of
11483: its quantity, it is not said how large it is; consequently its
11484: conception is not the conception of a maximum. We cogitate in it merely
11485: its relation to an arbitrarily assumed unit, in relation to which it is
11486: greater than any number. Now, just as the unit which is taken is
11487: greater or smaller, the infinite will be greater or smaller; but the
11488: infinity, which consists merely in the relation to this given unit,
11489: must remain always the same, although the absolute quantity of the
11490: whole is not thereby cognized.
11491: 
11492: The true (transcendental) conception of infinity is: that the
11493: successive synthesis of unity in the measurement of a given quantum can
11494: never be completed.[53] Hence it follows, without possibility of
11495: mistake, that an eternity of actual successive states up to a given
11496: (the present) moment cannot have elapsed, and that the world must
11497: therefore have a beginning.
11498: 
11499:  [53] The quantum in this sense contains a congeries of given units,
11500:  which is greater than any number—and this is the mathematical
11501:  conception of the infinite.
11502: 
11503: 
11504: In regard to the second part of the thesis, the difficulty as to an
11505: infinite and yet elapsed series disappears; for the manifold of a world
11506: infinite in extension is contemporaneously given. But, in order to
11507: cogitate the total of this manifold, as we cannot have the aid of
11508: limits constituting by themselves this total in intuition, we are
11509: obliged to give some account of our conception, which in this case
11510: cannot proceed from the whole to the determined quantity of the parts,
11511: but must demonstrate the possibility of a whole by means of a
11512: successive synthesis of the parts. But as this synthesis must
11513: constitute a series that cannot be completed, it is impossible for us
11514: to cogitate prior to it, and consequently not by means of it, a
11515: totality. For the conception of totality itself is in the present case
11516: the representation of a completed synthesis of the parts; and this
11517: completion, and consequently its conception, is impossible.
11518: 
11519: ON THE ANTITHESIS.
11520: 
11521: The proof in favour of the infinity of the cosmical succession and the
11522: cosmical content is based upon the consideration that, in the opposite
11523: case, a void time and a void space must constitute the limits of the
11524: world. Now I am not unaware, that there are some ways of escaping this
11525: conclusion. It may, for example, be alleged, that a limit to the world,
11526: as regards both space and time, is quite possible, without at the same
11527: time holding the existence of an absolute time before the beginning of
11528: the world, or an absolute space extending beyond the actual world—which
11529: is impossible. I am quite well satisfied with the latter part of this
11530: opinion of the philosophers of the Leibnitzian school. Space is merely
11531: the form of external intuition, but not a real object which can itself
11532: be externally intuited; it is not a correlate of phenomena, it is the
11533: form of phenomena itself. Space, therefore, cannot be regarded as
11534: absolutely and in itself something determinative of the existence of
11535: things, because it is not itself an object, but only the form of
11536: possible objects. Consequently, things, as phenomena, determine space;
11537: that is to say, they render it possible that, of all the possible
11538: predicates of space (size and relation), certain may belong to reality.
11539: But we cannot affirm the converse, that space, as something
11540: self-subsistent, can determine real things in regard to size or shape,
11541: for it is in itself not a real thing. Space (filled or void)[54] may
11542: therefore be limited by phenomena, but phenomena cannot be limited by
11543: an empty space without them. This is true of time also. All this being
11544: granted, it is nevertheless indisputable, that we must assume these two
11545: nonentities, void space without and void time before the world, if we
11546: assume the existence of cosmical limits, relatively to space or time.
11547: 
11548:  [54] It is evident that what is meant here is, that empty space, in so
11549:  far as it is limited by phenomena—space, that is, within the
11550:  world—does not at least contradict transcendental principles, and may
11551:  therefore, as regards them, be admitted, although its possibility
11552:  cannot on that account be affirmed.
11553: 
11554: 
11555: For, as regards the subterfuge adopted by those who endeavour to evade
11556: the consequence—that, if the world is limited as to space and time, the
11557: infinite void must determine the existence of actual things in regard
11558: to their dimensions—it arises solely from the fact that instead of a
11559: sensuous world, an intelligible world—of which nothing is known—is
11560: cogitated; instead of a real beginning (an existence, which is preceded
11561: by a period in which nothing exists), an existence which presupposes no
11562: other condition than that of time; and, instead of limits of extension,
11563: boundaries of the universe. But the question relates to the mundus
11564: phaenomenon, and its quantity; and in this case we cannot make
11565: abstraction of the conditions of sensibility, without doing away with
11566: the essential reality of this world itself. The world of sense, if it
11567: is limited, must necessarily lie in the infinite void. If this, and
11568: with it space as the à priori condition of the possibility of
11569: phenomena, is left out of view, the whole world of sense disappears. In
11570: our problem is this alone considered as given. The mundus
11571: intelligibilis is nothing but the general conception of a world, in
11572: which abstraction has been made of all conditions of intuition, and in
11573: relation to which no synthetical proposition—either affirmative or
11574: negative—is possible.
11575: 
11576: SECOND CONFLICT OF TRANSCENDENTAL IDEAS. THESIS.
11577: 
11578: Every composite substance in the world consists of simple parts; and
11579: there exists nothing that is not either itself simple, or composed of
11580: simple parts.
11581: 
11582: PROOF.
11583: 
11584: For, grant that composite substances do not consist of simple parts; in
11585: this case, if all combination or composition were annihilated in
11586: thought, no composite part, and (as, by the supposition, there do not
11587: exist simple parts) no simple part would exist. Consequently, no
11588: substance; consequently, nothing would exist. Either, then, it is
11589: impossible to annihilate composition in thought; or, after such
11590: annihilation, there must remain something that subsists without
11591: composition, that is, something that is simple. But in the former case
11592: the composite could not itself consist of substances, because with
11593: substances composition is merely a contingent relation, apart from
11594: which they must still exist as self-subsistent beings. Now, as this
11595: case contradicts the supposition, the second must contain the
11596: truth—that the substantial composite in the world consists of simple
11597: parts.
11598: 
11599: It follows, as an immediate inference, that the things in the world are
11600: all, without exception, simple beings—that composition is merely an
11601: external condition pertaining to them—and that, although we never can
11602: separate and isolate the elementary substances from the state of
11603: composition, reason must cogitate these as the primary subjects of all
11604: composition, and consequently, as prior thereto—and as simple
11605: substances.
11606: 
11607: ANTITHESIS.
11608: 
11609: No composite thing in the world consists of simple parts; and there
11610: does not exist in the world any simple substance.
11611: 
11612: PROOF.
11613: 
11614: Let it be supposed that a composite thing (as substance) consists of
11615: simple parts. Inasmuch as all external relation, consequently all
11616: composition of substances, is possible only in space; the space,
11617: occupied by that which is composite, must consist of the same number of
11618: parts as is contained in the composite. But space does not consist of
11619: simple parts, but of spaces. Therefore, every part of the composite
11620: must occupy a space. But the absolutely primary parts of what is
11621: composite are simple. It follows that what is simple occupies a space.
11622: Now, as everything real that occupies a space, contains a manifold the
11623: parts of which are external to each other, and is consequently
11624: composite—and a real composite, not of accidents (for these cannot
11625: exist external to each other apart from substance), but of
11626: substances—it follows that the simple must be a substantial composite,
11627: which is self-contradictory.
11628: 
11629: The second proposition of the antithesis—that there exists in the world
11630: nothing that is simple—is here equivalent to the following: The
11631: existence of the absolutely simple cannot be demonstrated from any
11632: experience or perception either external or internal; and the
11633: absolutely simple is a mere idea, the objective reality of which cannot
11634: be demonstrated in any possible experience; it is consequently, in the
11635: exposition of phenomena, without application and object. For, let us
11636: take for granted that an object may be found in experience for this
11637: transcendental idea; the empirical intuition of such an object must
11638: then be recognized to contain absolutely no manifold with its parts
11639: external to each other, and connected into unity. Now, as we cannot
11640: reason from the non-consciousness of such a manifold to the
11641: impossibility of its existence in the intuition of an object, and as
11642: the proof of this impossibility is necessary for the establishment and
11643: proof of absolute simplicity; it follows that this simplicity cannot be
11644: inferred from any perception whatever. As, therefore, an absolutely
11645: simple object cannot be given in any experience, and the world of sense
11646: must be considered as the sum total of all possible experiences:
11647: nothing simple exists in the world.
11648: 
11649: This second proposition in the antithesis has a more extended aim than
11650: the first. The first merely banishes the simple from the intuition of
11651: the composite; while the second drives it entirely out of nature. Hence
11652: we were unable to demonstrate it from the conception of a given object
11653: of external intuition (of the composite), but we were obliged to prove
11654: it from the relation of a given object to a possible experience in
11655: general.
11656: 
11657: OBSERVATIONS ON THE SECOND ANTINOMY. THESIS.
11658: 
11659: When I speak of a whole, which necessarily consists of simple parts, I
11660: understand thereby only a substantial whole, as the true composite;
11661: that is to say, I understand that contingent unity of the manifold
11662: which is given as perfectly isolated (at least in thought), placed in
11663: reciprocal connection, and thus constituted a unity. Space ought not to
11664: be called a compositum but a totum, for its parts are possible in the
11665: whole, and not the whole by means of the parts. It might perhaps be
11666: called a compositum ideale, but not a compositum reale. But this is of
11667: no importance. As space is not a composite of substances (and not even
11668: of real accidents), if I abstract all composition therein—nothing, not
11669: even a point, remains; for a point is possible only as the limit of a
11670: space—consequently of a composite. Space and time, therefore, do not
11671: consist of simple parts. That which belongs only to the condition or
11672: state of a substance, even although it possesses a quantity (motion or
11673: change, for example), likewise does not consist of simple parts. That
11674: is to say, a certain degree of change does not originate from the
11675: addition of many simple changes. Our inference of the simple from the
11676: composite is valid only of self-subsisting things. But the accidents of
11677: a state are not self-subsistent. The proof, then, for the necessity of
11678: the simple, as the component part of all that is substantial and
11679: composite, may prove a failure, and the whole case of this thesis be
11680: lost, if we carry the proposition too far, and wish to make it valid of
11681: everything that is composite without distinction—as indeed has really
11682: now and then happened. Besides, I am here speaking only of the simple,
11683: in so far as it is necessarily given in the composite—the latter being
11684: capable of solution into the former as its component parts. The proper
11685: signification of the word monas (as employed by Leibnitz) ought to
11686: relate to the simple, given immediately as simple substance (for
11687: example, in consciousness), and not as an element of the composite. As
11688: an clement, the term atomus would be more appropriate. And as I wish to
11689: prove the existence of simple substances, only in relation to, and as
11690: the elements of, the composite, I might term the antithesis of the
11691: second Antinomy, transcendental Atomistic. But as this word has long
11692: been employed to designate a particular theory of corporeal phenomena
11693: (moleculae), and thus presupposes a basis of empirical conceptions, I
11694: prefer calling it the dialectical principle of Monadology.
11695: 
11696: ANTITHESIS.
11697: 
11698: Against the assertion of the infinite subdivisibility of matter whose
11699: ground of proof is purely mathematical, objections have been alleged by
11700: the Monadists. These objections lay themselves open, at first sight, to
11701: suspicion, from the fact that they do not recognize the clearest
11702: mathematical proofs as propositions relating to the constitution of
11703: space, in so far as it is really the formal condition of the
11704: possibility of all matter, but regard them merely as inferences from
11705: abstract but arbitrary conceptions, which cannot have any application
11706: to real things. Just as if it were possible to imagine another mode of
11707: intuition than that given in the primitive intuition of space; and just
11708: as if its à priori determinations did not apply to everything, the
11709: existence of which is possible, from the fact alone of its filling
11710: space. If we listen to them, we shall find ourselves required to
11711: cogitate, in addition to the mathematical point, which is simple—not,
11712: however, a part, but a mere limit of space—physical points, which are
11713: indeed likewise simple, but possess the peculiar property, as parts of
11714: space, of filling it merely by their aggregation. I shall not repeat
11715: here the common and clear refutations of this absurdity, which are to
11716: be found everywhere in numbers: every one knows that it is impossible
11717: to undermine the evidence of mathematics by mere discursive
11718: conceptions; I shall only remark that, if in this case philosophy
11719: endeavours to gain an advantage over mathematics by sophistical
11720: artifices, it is because it forgets that the discussion relates solely
11721: to Phenomena and their conditions. It is not sufficient to find the
11722: conception of the simple for the pure conception of the composite, but
11723: we must discover for the intuition of the composite (matter), the
11724: intuition of the simple. Now this, according to the laws of
11725: sensibility, and consequently in the case of objects of sense, is
11726: utterly impossible. In the case of a whole composed of substances,
11727: which is cogitated solely by the pure understanding, it may be
11728: necessary to be in possession of the simple before composition is
11729: possible. But this does not hold good of the Totum substantiale
11730: phaenomenon, which, as an empirical intuition in space, possesses the
11731: necessary property of containing no simple part, for the very reason
11732: that no part of space is simple. Meanwhile, the Monadists have been
11733: subtle enough to escape from this difficulty, by presupposing intuition
11734: and the dynamical relation of substances as the condition of the
11735: possibility of space, instead of regarding space as the condition of
11736: the possibility of the objects of external intuition, that is, of
11737: bodies. Now we have a conception of bodies only as phenomena, and, as
11738: such, they necessarily presuppose space as the condition of all
11739: external phenomena. The evasion is therefore in vain; as, indeed, we
11740: have sufficiently shown in our Æsthetic. If bodies were things in
11741: themselves, the proof of the Monadists would be unexceptionable.
11742: 
11743: The second dialectical assertion possesses the peculiarity of having
11744: opposed to it a dogmatical proposition, which, among all such
11745: sophistical statements, is the only one that undertakes to prove in the
11746: case of an object of experience, that which is properly a
11747: transcendental idea—the absolute simplicity of substance. The
11748: proposition is that the object of the internal sense, the thinking Ego,
11749: is an absolute simple substance. Without at present entering upon this
11750: subject—as it has been considered at length in a former chapter—I shall
11751: merely remark that, if something is cogitated merely as an object,
11752: without the addition of any synthetical determination of its
11753: intuition—as happens in the case of the bare representation, I—it is
11754: certain that no manifold and no composition can be perceived in such a
11755: representation. As, moreover, the predicates whereby I cogitate this
11756: object are merely intuitions of the internal sense, there cannot be
11757: discovered in them anything to prove the existence of a manifold whose
11758: parts are external to each other, and, consequently, nothing to prove
11759: the existence of real composition. Consciousness, therefore, is so
11760: constituted that, inasmuch as the thinking subject is at the same time
11761: its own object, it cannot divide itself—although it can divide its
11762: inhering determinations. For every object in relation to itself is
11763: absolute unity. Nevertheless, if the subject is regarded externally, as
11764: an object of intuition, it must, in its character of phenomenon,
11765: possess the property of composition. And it must always be regarded in
11766: this manner, if we wish to know whether there is or is not contained in
11767: it a manifold whose parts are external to each other.
11768: 
11769: THIRD CONFLICT OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL IDEAS. THESIS.
11770: 
11771: Causality according to the laws of nature, is not the only causality
11772: operating to originate the phenomena of the world. A causality of
11773: freedom is also necessary to account fully for these phenomena.
11774: 
11775: PROOF.
11776: 
11777: Let it be supposed, that there is no other kind of causality than that
11778: according to the laws of nature. Consequently, everything that happens
11779: presupposes a previous condition, which it follows with absolute
11780: certainty, in conformity with a rule. But this previous condition must
11781: itself be something that has happened (that has arisen in time, as it
11782: did not exist before), for, if it has always been in existence, its
11783: consequence or effect would not thus originate for the first time, but
11784: would likewise have always existed. The causality, therefore, of a
11785: cause, whereby something happens, is itself a thing that has happened.
11786: Now this again presupposes, in conformity with the law of nature, a
11787: previous condition and its causality, and this another anterior to the
11788: former, and so on. If, then, everything happens solely in accordance
11789: with the laws of nature, there cannot be any real first beginning of
11790: things, but only a subaltern or comparative beginning. There cannot,
11791: therefore, be a completeness of series on the side of the causes which
11792: originate the one from the other. But the law of nature is that nothing
11793: can happen without a sufficient à priori determined cause. The
11794: proposition therefore—if all causality is possible only in accordance
11795: with the laws of nature—is, when stated in this unlimited and general
11796: manner, self-contradictory. It follows that this cannot be the only
11797: kind of causality.
11798: 
11799: From what has been said, it follows that a causality must be admitted,
11800: by means of which something happens, without its cause being determined
11801: according to necessary laws by some other cause preceding. That is to
11802: say, there must exist an absolute spontaneity of cause, which of itself
11803: originates a series of phenomena which proceeds according to natural
11804: laws—consequently transcendental freedom, without which even in the
11805: course of nature the succession of phenomena on the side of causes is
11806: never complete.
11807: 
11808: ANTITHESIS.
11809: 
11810: There is no such thing as freedom, but everything in the world happens
11811: solely according to the laws of nature.
11812: 
11813: PROOF.
11814: 
11815: Granted, that there does exist freedom in the transcendental sense, as
11816: a peculiar kind of causality, operating to produce events in the
11817: world—a faculty, that is to say, of originating a state, and
11818: consequently a series of consequences from that state. In this case,
11819: not only the series originated by this spontaneity, but the
11820: determination of this spontaneity itself to the production of the
11821: series, that is to say, the causality itself must have an absolute
11822: commencement, such that nothing can precede to determine this action
11823: according to unvarying laws. But every beginning of action presupposes
11824: in the acting cause a state of inaction; and a dynamically primal
11825: beginning of action presupposes a state, which has no connection—as
11826: regards causality—with the preceding state of the cause—which does not,
11827: that is, in any wise result from it. Transcendental freedom is
11828: therefore opposed to the natural law of cause and effect, and such a
11829: conjunction of successive states in effective causes is destructive of
11830: the possibility of unity in experience and for that reason not to be
11831: found in experience—is consequently a mere fiction of thought.
11832: 
11833: We have, therefore, nothing but nature to which we must look for
11834: connection and order in cosmical events. Freedom—independence of the
11835: laws of nature—is certainly a deliverance from restraint, but it is
11836: also a relinquishing of the guidance of law and rule. For it cannot be
11837: alleged that, instead of the laws of nature, laws of freedom may be
11838: introduced into the causality of the course of nature. For, if freedom
11839: were determined according to laws, it would be no longer freedom, but
11840: merely nature. Nature, therefore, and transcendental freedom are
11841: distinguishable as conformity to law and lawlessness. The former
11842: imposes upon understanding the difficulty of seeking the origin of
11843: events ever higher and higher in the series of causes, inasmuch as
11844: causality is always conditioned thereby; while it compensates this
11845: labour by the guarantee of a unity complete and in conformity with law.
11846: The latter, on the contrary, holds out to the understanding the promise
11847: of a point of rest in the chain of causes, by conducting it to an
11848: unconditioned causality, which professes to have the power of
11849: spontaneous origination, but which, in its own utter blindness,
11850: deprives it of the guidance of rules, by which alone a completely
11851: connected experience is possible.
11852: 
11853: OBSERVATIONS ON THE THIRD ANTINOMY. ON THE THESIS.
11854: 
11855: The transcendental idea of freedom is far from constituting the entire
11856: content of the psychological conception so termed, which is for the
11857: most part empirical. It merely presents us with the conception of
11858: spontaneity of action, as the proper ground for imputing freedom to the
11859: cause of a certain class of objects. It is, however, the true
11860: stumbling-stone to philosophy, which meets with unconquerable
11861: difficulties in the way of its admitting this kind of unconditioned
11862: causality. That element in the question of the freedom of the will,
11863: which has for so long a time placed speculative reason in such
11864: perplexity, is properly only transcendental, and concerns the question,
11865: whether there must be held to exist a faculty of spontaneous
11866: origination of a series of successive things or states. How such a
11867: faculty is possible is not a necessary inquiry; for in the case of
11868: natural causality itself, we are obliged to content ourselves with the
11869: à priori knowledge that such a causality must be presupposed, although
11870: we are quite incapable of comprehending how the being of one thing is
11871: possible through the being of another, but must for this information
11872: look entirely to experience. Now we have demonstrated this necessity of
11873: a free first beginning of a series of phenomena, only in so far as it
11874: is required for the comprehension of an origin of the world, all
11875: following states being regarded as a succession according to laws of
11876: nature alone. But, as there has thus been proved the existence of a
11877: faculty which can of itself originate a series in time—although we are
11878: unable to explain how it can exist—we feel ourselves authorized to
11879: admit, even in the midst of the natural course of events, a beginning,
11880: as regards causality, of different successions of phenomena, and at the
11881: same time to attribute to all substances a faculty of free action. But
11882: we ought in this case not to allow ourselves to fall into a common
11883: misunderstanding, and to suppose that, because a successive series in
11884: the world can only have a comparatively first beginning—another state
11885: or condition of things always preceding—an absolutely first beginning
11886: of a series in the course of nature is impossible. For we are not
11887: speaking here of an absolutely first beginning in relation to time, but
11888: as regards causality alone. When, for example, I, completely of my own
11889: free will, and independently of the necessarily determinative influence
11890: of natural causes, rise from my chair, there commences with this event,
11891: including its material consequences in infinitum, an absolutely new
11892: series; although, in relation to time, this event is merely the
11893: continuation of a preceding series. For this resolution and act of mine
11894: do not form part of the succession of effects in nature, and are not
11895: mere continuations of it; on the contrary, the determining causes of
11896: nature cease to operate in reference to this event, which certainly
11897: succeeds the acts of nature, but does not proceed from them. For these
11898: reasons, the action of a free agent must be termed, in regard to
11899: causality, if not in relation to time, an absolutely primal beginning
11900: of a series of phenomena.
11901: 
11902: The justification of this need of reason to rest upon a free act as the
11903: first beginning of the series of natural causes is evident from the
11904: fact, that all philosophers of antiquity (with the exception of the
11905: Epicurean school) felt themselves obliged, when constructing a theory
11906: of the motions of the universe, to accept a prime mover, that is, a
11907: freely acting cause, which spontaneously and prior to all other causes
11908: evolved this series of states. They always felt the need of going
11909: beyond mere nature, for the purpose of making a first beginning
11910: comprehensible.
11911: 
11912: ON THE ANTITHESIS.
11913: 
11914: The assertor of the all-sufficiency of nature in regard to causality
11915: (transcendental Physiocracy), in opposition to the doctrine of freedom,
11916: would defend his view of the question somewhat in the following manner.
11917: He would say, in answer to the sophistical arguments of the opposite
11918: party: If you do not accept a mathematical first, in relation to time,
11919: you have no need to seek a dynamical first, in regard to causality. Who
11920: compelled you to imagine an absolutely primal condition of the world,
11921: and therewith an absolute beginning of the gradually progressing
11922: successions of phenomena—and, as some foundation for this fancy of
11923: yours, to set bounds to unlimited nature? Inasmuch as the substances in
11924: the world have always existed—at least the unity of experience renders
11925: such a supposition quite necessary—there is no difficulty in believing
11926: also, that the changes in the conditions of these substances have
11927: always existed; and, consequently, that a first beginning, mathematical
11928: or dynamical, is by no means required. The possibility of such an
11929: infinite derivation, without any initial member from which all the
11930: others result, is certainly quite incomprehensible. But, if you are
11931: rash enough to deny the enigmatical secrets of nature for this reason,
11932: you will find yourselves obliged to deny also the existence of many
11933: fundamental properties of natural objects (such as fundamental forces),
11934: which you can just as little comprehend; and even the possibility of so
11935: simple a conception as that of change must present to you insuperable
11936: difficulties. For if experience did not teach you that it was real, you
11937: never could conceive à priori the possibility of this ceaseless
11938: sequence of being and non-being.
11939: 
11940: But if the existence of a transcendental faculty of freedom is
11941: granted—a faculty of originating changes in the world—this faculty must
11942: at least exist out of and apart from the world; although it is
11943: certainly a bold assumption, that, over and above the complete content
11944: of all possible intuitions, there still exists an object which cannot
11945: be presented in any possible perception. But, to attribute to
11946: substances in the world itself such a faculty, is quite inadmissible;
11947: for, in this case; the connection of phenomena reciprocally determining
11948: and determined according to general laws, which is termed nature, and
11949: along with it the criteria of empirical truth, which enable us to
11950: distinguish experience from mere visionary dreaming, would almost
11951: entirely disappear. In proximity with such a lawless faculty of
11952: freedom, a system of nature is hardly cogitable; for the laws of the
11953: latter would be continually subject to the intrusive influences of the
11954: former, and the course of phenomena, which would otherwise proceed
11955: regularly and uniformly, would become thereby confused and
11956: disconnected.
11957: 
11958: FOURTH CONFLICT OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL IDEAS. THESIS.
11959: 
11960: There exists either in, or in connection with the world—either as a
11961: part of it, or as the cause of it—an absolutely necessary being.
11962: 
11963: PROOF.
11964: 
11965: The world of sense, as the sum total of all phenomena, contains a
11966: series of changes. For, without such a series, the mental
11967: representation of the series of time itself, as the condition of the
11968: possibility of the sensuous world, could not be presented to us.[55]
11969: But every change stands under its condition, which precedes it in time
11970: and renders it necessary. Now the existence of a given condition
11971: presupposes a complete series of conditions up to the absolutely
11972: unconditioned, which alone is absolutely necessary. It follows that
11973: something that is absolutely necessary must exist, if change exists as
11974: its consequence. But this necessary thing itself belongs to the
11975: sensuous world. For suppose it to exist out of and apart from it, the
11976: series of cosmical changes would receive from it a beginning, and yet
11977: this necessary cause would not itself belong to the world of sense. But
11978: this is impossible. For, as the beginning of a series in time is
11979: determined only by that which precedes it in time, the supreme
11980: condition of the beginning of a series of changes must exist in the
11981: time in which this series itself did not exist; for a beginning
11982: supposes a time preceding, in which the thing that begins to be was not
11983: in existence. The causality of the necessary cause of changes, and
11984: consequently the cause itself, must for these reasons belong to
11985: time—and to phenomena, time being possible only as the form of
11986: phenomena. Consequently, it cannot be cogitated as separated from the
11987: world of sense—the sum total of all phenomena. There is, therefore,
11988: contained in the world, something that is absolutely necessary—whether
11989: it be the whole cosmical series itself, or only a part of it.
11990: 
11991:  [55] Objectively, time, as the formal condition of the possibility of
11992:  change, precedes all changes; but subjectively, and in consciousness,
11993:  the representation of time, like every other, is given solely by
11994:  occasion of perception.
11995: 
11996: 
11997: ANTITHESIS.
11998: 
11999: An absolutely necessary being does not exist, either in the world, or
12000: out of it—as its cause.
12001: 
12002: PROOF.
12003: 
12004: Grant that either the world itself is necessary, or that there is
12005: contained in it a necessary existence. Two cases are possible. First,
12006: there must either be in the series of cosmical changes a beginning,
12007: which is unconditionally necessary, and therefore uncaused—which is at
12008: variance with the dynamical law of the determination of all phenomena
12009: in time; or, secondly, the series itself is without beginning, and,
12010: although contingent and conditioned in all its parts, is nevertheless
12011: absolutely necessary and unconditioned as a whole—which is
12012: self-contradictory. For the existence of an aggregate cannot be
12013: necessary, if no single part of it possesses necessary existence.
12014: 
12015: Grant, on the other hand, that an absolutely necessary cause exists out
12016: of and apart from the world. This cause, as the highest member in the
12017: series of the causes of cosmical changes, must originate or begin[56]
12018: the existence of the latter and their series. In this case it must also
12019: begin to act, and its causality would therefore belong to time, and
12020: consequently to the sum total of phenomena, that is, to the world. It
12021: follows that the cause cannot be out of the world; which is
12022: contradictory to the hypothesis. Therefore, neither in the world, nor
12023: out of it (but in causal connection with it), does there exist any
12024: absolutely necessary being.
12025: 
12026:  [56] The word begin is taken in two senses. The first is active—the
12027:  cause being regarded as beginning a series of conditions as its effect
12028:  (infit). The second is passive—the causality in the cause itself
12029:  beginning to operate (fit). I reason here from the first to the
12030:  second.
12031: 
12032: 
12033: OBSERVATIONS ON THE FOURTH ANTINOMY. ON THE THESIS.
12034: 
12035: To demonstrate the existence of a necessary being, I cannot be
12036: permitted in this place to employ any other than the cosmological
12037: argument, which ascends from the conditioned in phenomena to the
12038: unconditioned in conception—the unconditioned being considered the
12039: necessary condition of the absolute totality of the series. The proof,
12040: from the mere idea of a supreme being, belongs to another principle of
12041: reason and requires separate discussion.
12042: 
12043: The pure cosmological proof demonstrates the existence of a necessary
12044: being, but at the same time leaves it quite unsettled, whether this
12045: being is the world itself, or quite distinct from it. To establish the
12046: truth of the latter view, principles are requisite, which are not
12047: cosmological and do not proceed in the series of phenomena. We should
12048: require to introduce into our proof conceptions of contingent
12049: beings—regarded merely as objects of the understanding, and also a
12050: principle which enables us to connect these, by means of mere
12051: conceptions, with a necessary being. But the proper place for all such
12052: arguments is a transcendent philosophy, which has unhappily not yet
12053: been established.
12054: 
12055: But, if we begin our proof cosmologically, by laying at the foundation
12056: of it the series of phenomena, and the regress in it according to
12057: empirical laws of causality, we are not at liberty to break off from
12058: this mode of demonstration and to pass over to something which is not
12059: itself a member of the series. The condition must be taken in exactly
12060: the same signification as the relation of the conditioned to its
12061: condition in the series has been taken, for the series must conduct us
12062: in an unbroken regress to this supreme condition. But if this relation
12063: is sensuous, and belongs to the possible empirical employment of
12064: understanding, the supreme condition or cause must close the regressive
12065: series according to the laws of sensibility and consequently, must
12066: belong to the series of time. It follows that this necessary existence
12067: must be regarded as the highest member of the cosmical series.
12068: 
12069: Certain philosophers have, nevertheless, allowed themselves the liberty
12070: of making such a saltus (metabasis eis allo gonos). From the changes in
12071: the world they have concluded their empirical contingency, that is,
12072: their dependence on empirically-determined causes, and they thus
12073: admitted an ascending series of empirical conditions: and in this they
12074: are quite right. But as they could not find in this series any primal
12075: beginning or any highest member, they passed suddenly from the
12076: empirical conception of contingency to the pure category, which
12077: presents us with a series—not sensuous, but intellectual—whose
12078: completeness does certainly rest upon the existence of an absolutely
12079: necessary cause. Nay, more, this intellectual series is not tied to any
12080: sensuous conditions; and is therefore free from the condition of time,
12081: which requires it spontaneously to begin its causality in time. But
12082: such a procedure is perfectly inadmissible, as will be made plain from
12083: what follows.
12084: 
12085: In the pure sense of the categories, that is contingent the
12086: contradictory opposite of which is possible. Now we cannot reason from
12087: empirical contingency to intellectual. The opposite of that which is
12088: changed—the opposite of its state—is actual at another time, and is
12089: therefore possible. Consequently, it is not the contradictory opposite
12090: of the former state. To be that, it is necessary that, in the same time
12091: in which the preceding state existed, its opposite could have existed
12092: in its place; but such a cognition is not given us in the mere
12093: phenomenon of change. A body that was in motion = A, comes into a state
12094: of rest = non-A. Now it cannot be concluded from the fact that a state
12095: opposite to the state A follows it, that the contradictory opposite of
12096: A is possible; and that A is therefore contingent. To prove this, we
12097: should require to know that the state of rest could have existed in the
12098: very same time in which the motion took place. Now we know nothing more
12099: than that the state of rest was actual in the time that followed the
12100: state of motion; consequently, that it was also possible. But motion at
12101: one time, and rest at another time, are not contradictorily opposed to
12102: each other. It follows from what has been said that the succession of
12103: opposite determinations, that is, change, does not demonstrate the fact
12104: of contingency as represented in the conceptions of the pure
12105: understanding; and that it cannot, therefore, conduct us to the fact of
12106: the existence of a necessary being. Change proves merely empirical
12107: contingency, that is to say, that the new state could not have existed
12108: without a cause, which belongs to the preceding time. This cause—even
12109: although it is regarded as absolutely necessary—must be presented to us
12110: in time, and must belong to the series of phenomena.
12111: 
12112: ON THE ANTITHESIS.
12113: 
12114: The difficulties which meet us, in our attempt to rise through the
12115: series of phenomena to the existence of an absolutely necessary supreme
12116: cause, must not originate from our inability to establish the truth of
12117: our mere conceptions of the necessary existence of a thing. That is to
12118: say, our objections not be ontological, but must be directed against
12119: the causal connection with a series of phenomena of a condition which
12120: is itself unconditioned. In one word, they must be cosmological and
12121: relate to empirical laws. We must show that the regress in the series
12122: of causes (in the world of sense) cannot conclude with an empirically
12123: unconditioned condition, and that the cosmological argument from the
12124: contingency of the cosmical state—a contingency alleged to arise from
12125: change—does not justify us in accepting a first cause, that is, a prime
12126: originator of the cosmical series.
12127: 
12128: The reader will observe in this antinomy a very remarkable contrast.
12129: The very same grounds of proof which established in the thesis the
12130: existence of a supreme being, demonstrated in the antithesis—and with
12131: equal strictness—the non-existence of such a being. We found, first,
12132: that a necessary being exists, because the whole time past contains the
12133: series of all conditions, and with it, therefore, the unconditioned
12134: (the necessary); secondly, that there does not exist any necessary
12135: being, for the same reason, that the whole time past contains the
12136: series of all conditions—which are themselves, therefore, in the
12137: aggregate, conditioned. The cause of this seeming incongruity is as
12138: follows. We attend, in the first argument, solely to the absolute
12139: totality of the series of conditions, the one of which determines the
12140: other in time, and thus arrive at a necessary unconditioned. In the
12141: second, we consider, on the contrary, the contingency of everything
12142: that is determined in the series of time—for every event is preceded by
12143: a time, in which the condition itself must be determined as
12144: conditioned—and thus everything that is unconditioned or absolutely
12145: necessary disappears. In both, the mode of proof is quite in accordance
12146: with the common procedure of human reason, which often falls into
12147: discord with itself, from considering an object from two different
12148: points of view. Herr von Mairan regarded the controversy between two
12149: celebrated astronomers, which arose from a similar difficulty as to the
12150: choice of a proper standpoint, as a phenomenon of sufficient importance
12151: to warrant a separate treatise on the subject. The one concluded: the
12152: moon revolves on its own axis, because it constantly presents the same
12153: side to the earth; the other declared that the moon does not revolve on
12154: its own axis, for the same reason. Both conclusions were perfectly
12155: correct, according to the point of view from which the motions of the
12156: moon were considered.
12157: 
12158: Section III. Of the Interest of Reason in these Self-contradictions
12159: 
12160: We have thus completely before us the dialectical procedure of the
12161: cosmological ideas. No possible experience can present us with an
12162: object adequate to them in extent. Nay, more, reason itself cannot
12163: cogitate them as according with the general laws of experience. And yet
12164: they are not arbitrary fictions of thought. On the contrary, reason, in
12165: its uninterrupted progress in the empirical synthesis, is necessarily
12166: conducted to them, when it endeavours to free from all conditions and
12167: to comprehend in its unconditioned totality that which can only be
12168: determined conditionally in accordance with the laws of experience.
12169: These dialectical propositions are so many attempts to solve four
12170: natural and unavoidable problems of reason. There are neither more, nor
12171: can there be less, than this number, because there are no other series
12172: of synthetical hypotheses, limiting à priori the empirical synthesis.
12173: 
12174: The brilliant claims of reason striving to extend its dominion beyond
12175: the limits of experience, have been represented above only in dry
12176: formulae, which contain merely the grounds of its pretensions. They
12177: have, besides, in conformity with the character of a transcendental
12178: philosophy, been freed from every empirical element; although the full
12179: splendour of the promises they hold out, and the anticipations they
12180: excite, manifests itself only when in connection with empirical
12181: cognitions. In the application of them, however, and in the advancing
12182: enlargement of the employment of reason, while struggling to rise from
12183: the region of experience and to soar to those sublime ideas, philosophy
12184: discovers a value and a dignity, which, if it could but make good its
12185: assertions, would raise it far above all other departments of human
12186: knowledge—professing, as it does, to present a sure foundation for our
12187: highest hopes and the ultimate aims of all the exertions of reason. The
12188: questions: whether the world has a beginning and a limit to its
12189: extension in space; whether there exists anywhere, or perhaps, in my
12190: own thinking Self, an indivisible and indestructible unity—or whether
12191: nothing but what is divisible and transitory exists; whether I am a
12192: free agent, or, like other beings, am bound in the chains of nature and
12193: fate; whether, finally, there is a supreme cause of the world, or all
12194: our thought and speculation must end with nature and the order of
12195: external things—are questions for the solution of which the
12196: mathematician would willingly exchange his whole science; for in it
12197: there is no satisfaction for the highest aspirations and most ardent
12198: desires of humanity. Nay, it may even be said that the true value of
12199: mathematics—that pride of human reason—consists in this: that she
12200: guides reason to the knowledge of nature—in her greater as well as in
12201: her less manifestations—in her beautiful order and regularity—guides
12202: her, moreover, to an insight into the wonderful unity of the moving
12203: forces in the operations of nature, far beyond the expectations of a
12204: philosophy building only on experience; and that she thus encourages
12205: philosophy to extend the province of reason beyond all experience, and
12206: at the same time provides it with the most excellent materials for
12207: supporting its investigations, in so far as their nature admits, by
12208: adequate and accordant intuitions.
12209: 
12210: Unfortunately for speculation—but perhaps fortunately for the practical
12211: interests of humanity—reason, in the midst of her highest
12212: anticipations, finds herself hemmed in by a press of opposite and
12213: contradictory conclusions, from which neither her honour nor her safety
12214: will permit her to draw back. Nor can she regard these conflicting
12215: trains of reasoning with indifference as mere passages at arms, still
12216: less can she command peace; for in the subject of the conflict she has
12217: a deep interest. There is no other course left open to her than to
12218: reflect with herself upon the origin of this disunion in reason—whether
12219: it may not arise from a mere misunderstanding. After such an inquiry,
12220: arrogant claims would have to be given up on both sides; but the
12221: sovereignty of reason over understanding and sense would be based upon
12222: a sure foundation.
12223: 
12224: We shall at present defer this radical inquiry and, in the meantime,
12225: consider for a little what side in the controversy we should most
12226: willingly take, if we were obliged to become partisans at all. As, in
12227: this case, we leave out of sight altogether the logical criterion of
12228: truth, and merely consult our own interest in reference to the
12229: question, these considerations, although inadequate to settle the
12230: question of right in either party, will enable us to comprehend how
12231: those who have taken part in the struggle, adopt the one view rather
12232: than the other—no special insight into the subject, however, having
12233: influenced their choice. They will, at the same time, explain to us
12234: many other things by the way—for example, the fiery zeal on the one
12235: side and the cold maintenance of their cause on the other; why the one
12236: party has met with the warmest approbations, and the other has always
12237: been repulsed by irreconcilable prejudices.
12238: 
12239: There is one thing, however, that determines the proper point of view,
12240: from which alone this preliminary inquiry can be instituted and carried
12241: on with the proper completeness—and that is the comparison of the
12242: principles from which both sides, thesis and antithesis, proceed. My
12243: readers would remark in the propositions of the antithesis a complete
12244: uniformity in the mode of thought and a perfect unity of principle. Its
12245: principle was that of pure empiricism, not only in the explication of
12246: the phenomena in the world, but also in the solution of the
12247: transcendental ideas, even of that of the universe itself. The
12248: affirmations of the thesis, on the contrary, were based, in addition to
12249: the empirical mode of explanation employed in the series of phenomena,
12250: on intellectual propositions; and its principles were in so far not
12251: simple. I shall term the thesis, in view of its essential
12252: characteristic, the dogmatism of pure reason.
12253: 
12254: On the side of Dogmatism, or of the thesis, therefore, in the
12255: determination of the cosmological ideas, we find:
12256: 
12257: 1. A practical interest, which must be very dear to every
12258: right-thinking man. That the word has a beginning—that the nature of my
12259: thinking self is simple, and therefore indestructible—that I am a free
12260: agent, and raised above the compulsion of nature and her laws—and,
12261: finally, that the entire order of things, which form the world, is
12262: dependent upon a Supreme Being, from whom the whole receives unity and
12263: connection—these are so many foundation-stones of morality and
12264: religion. The antithesis deprives us of all these supports—or, at
12265: least, seems so to deprive us.
12266: 
12267: 2. A speculative interest of reason manifests itself on this side. For,
12268: if we take the transcendental ideas and employ them in the manner which
12269: the thesis directs, we can exhibit completely à priori the entire chain
12270: of conditions, and understand the derivation of the
12271: conditioned—beginning from the unconditioned. This the antithesis does
12272: not do; and for this reason does not meet with so welcome a reception.
12273: For it can give no answer to our question respecting the conditions of
12274: its synthesis—except such as must be supplemented by another question,
12275: and so on to infinity. According to it, we must rise from a given
12276: beginning to one still higher; every part conducts us to a still
12277: smaller one; every event is preceded by another event which is its
12278: cause; and the conditions of existence rest always upon other and still
12279: higher conditions, and find neither end nor basis in some
12280: self-subsistent thing as the primal being.
12281: 
12282: 3. This side has also the advantage of popularity; and this constitutes
12283: no small part of its claim to favour. The common understanding does not
12284: find the least difficulty in the idea of the unconditioned beginning of
12285: all synthesis—accustomed, as it is, rather to follow our consequences
12286: than to seek for a proper basis for cognition. In the conception of an
12287: absolute first, moreover—the possibility of which it does not inquire
12288: into—it is highly gratified to find a firmly-established point of
12289: departure for its attempts at theory; while in the restless and
12290: continuous ascent from the conditioned to the condition, always with
12291: one foot in the air, it can find no satisfaction.
12292: 
12293: On the side of the antithesis, or Empiricism, in the determination of
12294: the cosmological ideas:
12295: 
12296: 1. We cannot discover any such practical interest arising from pure
12297: principles of reason as morality and religion present. On the contrary,
12298: pure empiricism seems to empty them of all their power and influence.
12299: If there does not exist a Supreme Being distinct from the world—if the
12300: world is without beginning, consequently without a Creator—if our wills
12301: are not free, and the soul is divisible and subject to corruption just
12302: like matter—the ideas and principles of morality lose all validity and
12303: fall with the transcendental ideas which constituted their theoretical
12304: support.
12305: 
12306: 2. But empiricism, in compensation, holds out to reason, in its
12307: speculative interests, certain important advantages, far exceeding any
12308: that the dogmatist can promise us. For, when employed by the
12309: empiricist, understanding is always upon its proper ground of
12310: investigation—the field of possible experience, the laws of which it
12311: can explore, and thus extend its cognition securely and with clear
12312: intelligence without being stopped by limits in any direction. Here can
12313: it and ought it to find and present to intuition its proper object—not
12314: only in itself, but in all its relations; or, if it employ conceptions,
12315: upon this ground it can always present the corresponding images in
12316: clear and unmistakable intuitions. It is quite unnecessary for it to
12317: renounce the guidance of nature, to attach itself to ideas, the objects
12318: of which it cannot know; because, as mere intellectual entities, they
12319: cannot be presented in any intuition. On the contrary, it is not even
12320: permitted to abandon its proper occupation, under the pretence that it
12321: has been brought to a conclusion (for it never can be), and to pass
12322: into the region of idealizing reason and transcendent conceptions,
12323: which it is not required to observe and explore the laws of nature, but
12324: merely to think and to imagine—secure from being contradicted by facts,
12325: because they have not been called as witnesses, but passed by, or
12326: perhaps subordinated to the so-called higher interests and
12327: considerations of pure reason.
12328: 
12329: Hence the empiricist will never allow himself to accept any epoch of
12330: nature for the first—the absolutely primal state; he will not believe
12331: that there can be limits to his outlook into her wide domains, nor pass
12332: from the objects of nature, which he can satisfactorily explain by
12333: means of observation and mathematical thought—which he can determine
12334: synthetically in intuition, to those which neither sense nor
12335: imagination can ever present in concreto; he will not concede the
12336: existence of a faculty in nature, operating independently of the laws
12337: of nature—a concession which would introduce uncertainty into the
12338: procedure of the understanding, which is guided by necessary laws to
12339: the observation of phenomena; nor, finally, will he permit himself to
12340: seek a cause beyond nature, inasmuch as we know nothing but it, and
12341: from it alone receive an objective basis for all our conceptions and
12342: instruction in the unvarying laws of things.
12343: 
12344: In truth, if the empirical philosopher had no other purpose in the
12345: establishment of his antithesis than to check the presumption of a
12346: reason which mistakes its true destination, which boasts of its insight
12347: and its knowledge, just where all insight and knowledge cease to exist,
12348: and regards that which is valid only in relation to a practical
12349: interest, as an advancement of the speculative interests of the mind
12350: (in order, when it is convenient for itself, to break the thread of our
12351: physical investigations, and, under pretence of extending our
12352: cognition, connect them with transcendental ideas, by means of which we
12353: really know only that we know nothing)—if, I say, the empiricist rested
12354: satisfied with this benefit, the principle advanced by him would be a
12355: maxim recommending moderation in the pretensions of reason and modesty
12356: in its affirmations, and at the same time would direct us to the right
12357: mode of extending the province of the understanding, by the help of the
12358: only true teacher, experience. In obedience to this advice,
12359: intellectual hypotheses and faith would not be called in aid of our
12360: practical interests; nor should we introduce them under the pompous
12361: titles of science and insight. For speculative cognition cannot find an
12362: objective basis any other where than in experience; and, when we
12363: overstep its limits our synthesis, which requires ever new cognitions
12364: independent of experience, has no substratum of intuition upon which to
12365: build.
12366: 
12367: But if—as often happens—empiricism, in relation to ideas, becomes
12368: itself dogmatic and boldly denies that which is above the sphere of its
12369: phenomenal cognition, it falls itself into the error of intemperance—an
12370: error which is here all the more reprehensible, as thereby the
12371: practical interest of reason receives an irreparable injury.
12372: 
12373: And this constitutes the opposition between Epicureanism[57] and
12374: Platonism.
12375: 
12376:  [57] It is, however, still a matter of doubt whether Epicurus ever
12377:  propounded these principles as directions for the objective employment
12378:  of the understanding. If, indeed, they were nothing more than maxims
12379:  for the speculative exercise of reason, he gives evidence therein a
12380:  more genuine philosophic spirit than any of the philosophers of
12381:  antiquity. That, in the explanation of phenomena, we must proceed as
12382:  if the field of inquiry had neither limits in space nor commencement
12383:  in time; that we must be satisfied with the teaching of experience in
12384:  reference to the material of which the world is posed; that we must
12385:  not look for any other mode of the origination of events than that
12386:  which is determined by the unalterable laws of nature; and finally,
12387:  that we not employ the hypothesis of a cause distinct from the world
12388:  to account for a phenomenon or for the world itself—are principles for
12389:  the extension of speculative philosophy, and the discovery of the true
12390:  sources of the principles of morals, which, however little conformed
12391:  to in the present day, are undoubtedly correct. At the same time, any
12392:  one desirous of ignoring, in mere speculation, these dogmatical
12393:  propositions, need not for that reason be accused of denying them.
12394: 
12395: 
12396: Both Epicurus and Plato assert more in their systems than they know.
12397: The former encourages and advances science—although to the prejudice of
12398: the practical; the latter presents us with excellent principles for the
12399: investigation of the practical, but, in relation to everything
12400: regarding which we can attain to speculative cognition, permits reason
12401: to append idealistic explanations of natural phenomena, to the great
12402: injury of physical investigation.
12403: 
12404: 3. In regard to the third motive for the preliminary choice of a party
12405: in this war of assertions, it seems very extraordinary that empiricism
12406: should be utterly unpopular. We should be inclined to believe that the
12407: common understanding would receive it with pleasure—promising as it
12408: does to satisfy it without passing the bounds of experience and its
12409: connected order; while transcendental dogmatism obliges it to rise to
12410: conceptions which far surpass the intelligence and ability of the most
12411: practised thinkers. But in this, in truth, is to be found its real
12412: motive. For the common understanding thus finds itself in a situation
12413: where not even the most learned can have the advantage of it. If it
12414: understands little or nothing about these transcendental conceptions,
12415: no one can boast of understanding any more; and although it may not
12416: express itself in so scholastically correct a manner as others, it can
12417: busy itself with reasoning and arguments without end, wandering among
12418: mere ideas, about which one can always be very eloquent, because we
12419: know nothing about them; while, in the observation and investigation of
12420: nature, it would be forced to remain dumb and to confess its utter
12421: ignorance. Thus indolence and vanity form of themselves strong
12422: recommendations of these principles. Besides, although it is a hard
12423: thing for a philosopher to assume a principle, of which he can give to
12424: himself no reasonable account, and still more to employ conceptions,
12425: the objective reality of which cannot be established, nothing is more
12426: usual with the common understanding. It wants something which will
12427: allow it to go to work with confidence. The difficulty of even
12428: comprehending a supposition does not disquiet it, because—not knowing
12429: what comprehending means—it never even thinks of the supposition it may
12430: be adopting as a principle; and regards as known that with which it has
12431: become familiar from constant use. And, at last, all speculative
12432: interests disappear before the practical interests which it holds dear;
12433: and it fancies that it understands and knows what its necessities and
12434: hopes incite it to assume or to believe. Thus the empiricism of
12435: transcendentally idealizing reason is robbed of all popularity; and,
12436: however prejudicial it may be to the highest practical principles,
12437: there is no fear that it will ever pass the limits of the schools, or
12438: acquire any favour or influence in society or with the multitude.
12439: 
12440: Human reason is by nature architectonic. That is to say, it regards all
12441: cognitions as parts of a possible system, and hence accepts only such
12442: principles as at least do not incapacitate a cognition to which we may
12443: have attained from being placed along with others in a general system.
12444: But the propositions of the antithesis are of a character which renders
12445: the completion of an edifice of cognitions impossible. According to
12446: these, beyond one state or epoch of the world there is always to be
12447: found one more ancient; in every part always other parts themselves
12448: divisible; preceding every event another, the origin of which must
12449: itself be sought still higher; and everything in existence is
12450: conditioned, and still not dependent on an unconditioned and primal
12451: existence. As, therefore, the antithesis will not concede the existence
12452: of a first beginning which might be available as a foundation, a
12453: complete edifice of cognition, in the presence of such hypothesis, is
12454: utterly impossible. Thus the architectonic interest of reason, which
12455: requires a unity—not empirical, but à priori and rational—forms a
12456: natural recommendation for the assertions of the thesis in our
12457: antinomy.
12458: 
12459: But if any one could free himself entirely from all considerations of
12460: interest, and weigh without partiality the assertions of reason,
12461: attending only to their content, irrespective of the consequences which
12462: follow from them; such a person, on the supposition that he knew no
12463: other way out of the confusion than to settle the truth of one or other
12464: of the conflicting doctrines, would live in a state of continual
12465: hesitation. Today, he would feel convinced that the human will is free;
12466: to-morrow, considering the indissoluble chain of nature, he would look
12467: on freedom as a mere illusion and declare nature to be all-in-all. But,
12468: if he were called to action, the play of the merely speculative reason
12469: would disappear like the shapes of a dream, and practical interest
12470: would dictate his choice of principles. But, as it well befits a
12471: reflective and inquiring being to devote certain periods of time to the
12472: examination of its own reason—to divest itself of all partiality, and
12473: frankly to communicate its observations for the judgement and opinion
12474: of others; so no one can be blamed for, much less prevented from,
12475: placing both parties on their trial, with permission to end themselves,
12476: free from intimidation, before intimidation, before a sworn jury of
12477: equal condition with themselves—the condition of weak and fallible men.
12478: 
12479: Section IV. Of the necessity imposed upon Pure Reason of presenting a
12480: Solution of its Transcendental Problems
12481: 
12482: To avow an ability to solve all problems and to answer all questions
12483: would be a profession certain to convict any philosopher of extravagant
12484: boasting and self-conceit, and at once to destroy the confidence that
12485: might otherwise have been reposed in him. There are, however, sciences
12486: so constituted that every question arising within their sphere must
12487: necessarily be capable of receiving an answer from the knowledge
12488: already possessed, for the answer must be received from the same
12489: sources whence the question arose. In such sciences it is not allowable
12490: to excuse ourselves on the plea of necessary and unavoidable ignorance;
12491: a solution is absolutely requisite. The rule of right and wrong must
12492: help us to the knowledge of what is right or wrong in all possible
12493: cases; otherwise, the idea of obligation or duty would be utterly null,
12494: for we cannot have any obligation to that which we cannot know. On the
12495: other hand, in our investigations of the phenomena of nature, much must
12496: remain uncertain, and many questions continue insoluble; because what
12497: we know of nature is far from being sufficient to explain all the
12498: phenomena that are presented to our observation. Now the question is:
12499: Whether there is in transcendental philosophy any question, relating to
12500: an object presented to pure reason, which is unanswerable by this
12501: reason; and whether we must regard the subject of the question as quite
12502: uncertain, so far as our knowledge extends, and must give it a place
12503: among those subjects, of which we have just so much conception as is
12504: sufficient to enable us to raise a question—faculty or materials
12505: failing us, however, when we attempt an answer.
12506: 
12507: Now I maintain that, among all speculative cognition, the peculiarity
12508: of transcendental philosophy is that there is no question, relating to
12509: an object presented to pure reason, which is insoluble by this reason;
12510: and that the profession of unavoidable ignorance—the problem being
12511: alleged to be beyond the reach of our faculties—cannot free us from the
12512: obligation to present a complete and satisfactory answer. For the very
12513: conception which enables us to raise the question must give us the
12514: power of answering it; inasmuch as the object, as in the case of right
12515: and wrong, is not to be discovered out of the conception.
12516: 
12517: But, in transcendental philosophy, it is only the cosmological
12518: questions to which we can demand a satisfactory answer in relation to
12519: the constitution of their object; and the philosopher is not permitted
12520: to avail himself of the pretext of necessary ignorance and impenetrable
12521: obscurity. These questions relate solely to the cosmological ideas. For
12522: the object must be given in experience, and the question relates to the
12523: adequateness of the object to an idea. If the object is transcendental
12524: and therefore itself unknown; if the question, for example, is whether
12525: the object—the something, the phenomenon of which (internal—in
12526: ourselves) is thought—that is to say, the soul, is in itself a simple
12527: being; or whether there is a cause of all things, which is absolutely
12528: necessary—in such cases we are seeking for our idea an object, of which
12529: we may confess that it is unknown to us, though we must not on that
12530: account assert that it is impossible.[58] The cosmological ideas alone
12531: posses the peculiarity that we can presuppose the object of them and
12532: the empirical synthesis requisite for the conception of that object to
12533: be given; and the question, which arises from these ideas, relates
12534: merely to the progress of this synthesis, in so far as it must contain
12535: absolute totality—which, however, is not empirical, as it cannot be
12536: given in any experience. Now, as the question here is solely in regard
12537: to a thing as the object of a possible experience and not as a thing in
12538: itself, the answer to the transcendental cosmological question need not
12539: be sought out of the idea, for the question does not regard an object
12540: in itself. The question in relation to a possible experience is not,
12541: “What can be given in an experience in concreto” but “what is contained
12542: in the idea, to which the empirical synthesis must approximate.” The
12543: question must therefore be capable of solution from the idea alone. For
12544: the idea is a creation of reason itself, which therefore cannot
12545: disclaim the obligation to answer or refer us to the unknown object.
12546: 
12547:  [58] The question, “What is the constitution of a transcendental
12548:  object?” is unanswerable—we are unable to say what it is; but we can
12549:  perceive that the question itself is nothing; because it does not
12550:  relate to any object that can be presented to us. For this reason, we
12551:  must consider all the questions raised in transcendental psychology as
12552:  answerable and as really answered; for they relate to the
12553:  transcendental subject of all internal phenomena, which is not itself
12554:  phenomenon and consequently not given as an object, in which,
12555:  moreover, none of the categories—and it is to them that the question
12556:  is properly directed—find any conditions of its application. Here,
12557:  therefore, is a case where no answer is the only proper answer. For a
12558:  question regarding the constitution of a something which cannot be
12559:  cogitated by any determined predicate, being completely beyond the
12560:  sphere of objects and experience, is perfectly null and void.
12561: 
12562: 
12563: It is not so extraordinary, as it at first sight appears, that a
12564: science should demand and expect satisfactory answers to all the
12565: questions that may arise within its own sphere (questiones domesticae),
12566: although, up to a certain time, these answers may not have been
12567: discovered. There are, in addition to transcendental philosophy, only
12568: two pure sciences of reason; the one with a speculative, the other with
12569: a practical content—pure mathematics and pure ethics. Has any one ever
12570: heard it alleged that, from our complete and necessary ignorance of the
12571: conditions, it is uncertain what exact relation the diameter of a
12572: circle bears to the circle in rational or irrational numbers? By the
12573: former the sum cannot be given exactly, by the latter only
12574: approximately; and therefore we decide that the impossibility of a
12575: solution of the question is evident. Lambert presented us with a
12576: demonstration of this. In the general principles of morals there can be
12577: nothing uncertain, for the propositions are either utterly without
12578: meaning, or must originate solely in our rational conceptions. On the
12579: other hand, there must be in physical science an infinite number of
12580: conjectures, which can never become certainties; because the phenomena
12581: of nature are not given as objects dependent on our conceptions. The
12582: key to the solution of such questions cannot, therefore, be found in
12583: our conceptions, or in pure thought, but must lie without us and for
12584: that reason is in many cases not to be discovered; and consequently a
12585: satisfactory explanation cannot be expected. The questions of
12586: transcendental analytic, which relate to the deduction of our pure
12587: cognition, are not to be regarded as of the same kind as those
12588: mentioned above; for we are not at present treating of the certainty of
12589: judgements in relation to the origin of our conceptions, but only of
12590: that certainty in relation to objects.
12591: 
12592: We cannot, therefore, escape the responsibility of at least a critical
12593: solution of the questions of reason, by complaints of the limited
12594: nature of our faculties, and the seemingly humble confession that it is
12595: beyond the power of our reason to decide, whether the world has existed
12596: from all eternity or had a beginning—whether it is infinitely extended,
12597: or enclosed within certain limits—whether anything in the world is
12598: simple, or whether everything must be capable of infinite
12599: divisibility—whether freedom can originate phenomena, or whether
12600: everything is absolutely dependent on the laws and order of nature—and,
12601: finally, whether there exists a being that is completely unconditioned
12602: and necessary, or whether the existence of everything is conditioned
12603: and consequently dependent on something external to itself, and
12604: therefore in its own nature contingent. For all these questions relate
12605: to an object, which can be given nowhere else than in thought. This
12606: object is the absolutely unconditioned totality of the synthesis of
12607: phenomena. If the conceptions in our minds do not assist us to some
12608: certain result in regard to these problems, we must not defend
12609: ourselves on the plea that the object itself remains hidden from and
12610: unknown to us. For no such thing or object can be given—it is not to be
12611: found out of the idea in our minds. We must seek the cause of our
12612: failure in our idea itself, which is an insoluble problem and in regard
12613: to which we obstinately assume that there exists a real object
12614: corresponding and adequate to it. A clear explanation of the dialectic
12615: which lies in our conception, will very soon enable us to come to a
12616: satisfactory decision in regard to such a question.
12617: 
12618: The pretext that we are unable to arrive at certainty in regard to
12619: these problems may be met with this question, which requires at least a
12620: plain answer: “From what source do the ideas originate, the solution of
12621: which involves you in such difficulties? Are you seeking for an
12622: explanation of certain phenomena; and do you expect these ideas to give
12623: you the principles or the rules of this explanation?” Let it be
12624: granted, that all nature was laid open before you; that nothing was hid
12625: from your senses and your consciousness. Still, you could not cognize
12626: in concreto the object of your ideas in any experience. For what is
12627: demanded is not only this full and complete intuition, but also a
12628: complete synthesis and the consciousness of its absolute totality; and
12629: this is not possible by means of any empirical cognition. It follows
12630: that your question—your idea—is by no means necessary for the
12631: explanation of any phenomenon; and the idea cannot have been in any
12632: sense given by the object itself. For such an object can never be
12633: presented to us, because it cannot be given by any possible experience.
12634: Whatever perceptions you may attain to, you are still surrounded by
12635: conditions—in space, or in time—and you cannot discover anything
12636: unconditioned; nor can you decide whether this unconditioned is to be
12637: placed in an absolute beginning of the synthesis, or in an absolute
12638: totality of the series without beginning. A whole, in the empirical
12639: signification of the term, is always merely comparative. The absolute
12640: whole of quantity (the universe), of division, of derivation, of the
12641: condition of existence, with the question—whether it is to be produced
12642: by finite or infinite synthesis, no possible experience can instruct us
12643: concerning. You will not, for example, be able to explain the phenomena
12644: of a body in the least degree better, whether you believe it to consist
12645: of simple, or of composite parts; for a simple phenomenon—and just as
12646: little an infinite series of composition—can never be presented to your
12647: perception. Phenomena require and admit of explanation, only in so far
12648: as the conditions of that explanation are given in perception; but the
12649: sum total of that which is given in phenomena, considered as an
12650: absolute whole, is itself a perception—and we cannot therefore seek for
12651: explanations of this whole beyond itself, in other perceptions. The
12652: explanation of this whole is the proper object of the transcendental
12653: problems of pure reason.
12654: 
12655: Although, therefore, the solution of these problems is unattainable
12656: through experience, we must not permit ourselves to say that it is
12657: uncertain how the object of our inquiries is constituted. For the
12658: object is in our own mind and cannot be discovered in experience; and
12659: we have only to take care that our thoughts are consistent with each
12660: other, and to avoid falling into the amphiboly of regarding our idea as
12661: a representation of an object empirically given, and therefore to be
12662: cognized according to the laws of experience. A dogmatical solution is
12663: therefore not only unsatisfactory but impossible. The critical
12664: solution, which may be a perfectly certain one, does not consider the
12665: question objectively, but proceeds by inquiring into the basis of the
12666: cognition upon which the question rests.
12667: 
12668: Section V. Sceptical Exposition of the Cosmological Problems presented
12669: in the four Transcendental Ideas
12670: 
12671: We should be quite willing to desist from the demand of a dogmatical
12672: answer to our questions, if we understood beforehand that, be the
12673: answer what it may, it would only serve to increase our ignorance, to
12674: throw us from one incomprehensibility into another, from one obscurity
12675: into another still greater, and perhaps lead us into irreconcilable
12676: contradictions. If a dogmatical affirmative or negative answer is
12677: demanded, is it at all prudent to set aside the probable grounds of a
12678: solution which lie before us and to take into consideration what
12679: advantage we shall gain, if the answer is to favour the one side or the
12680: other? If it happens that in both cases the answer is mere nonsense, we
12681: have in this an irresistible summons to institute a critical
12682: investigation of the question, for the purpose of discovering whether
12683: it is based on a groundless presupposition and relates to an idea, the
12684: falsity of which would be more easily exposed in its application and
12685: consequences than in the mere representation of its content. This is
12686: the great utility of the sceptical mode of treating the questions
12687: addressed by pure reason to itself. By this method we easily rid
12688: ourselves of the confusions of dogmatism, and establish in its place a
12689: temperate criticism, which, as a genuine cathartic, will successfully
12690: remove the presumptuous notions of philosophy and their consequence—the
12691: vain pretension to universal science.
12692: 
12693: If, then, I could understand the nature of a cosmological idea and
12694: perceive, before I entered on the discussion of the subject at all,
12695: that, whatever side of the question regarding the unconditioned of the
12696: regressive synthesis of phenomena it favoured—it must either be too
12697: great or too small for every conception of the understanding—I would be
12698: able to comprehend how the idea, which relates to an object of
12699: experience—an experience which must be adequate to and in accordance
12700: with a possible conception of the understanding—must be completely void
12701: and without significance, inasmuch as its object is inadequate,
12702: consider it as we may. And this is actually the case with all
12703: cosmological conceptions, which, for the reason above mentioned,
12704: involve reason, so long as it remains attached to them, in an
12705: unavoidable antinomy. For suppose:
12706: 
12707: First, that the world has no beginning—in this case it is too large for
12708: our conception; for this conception, which consists in a successive
12709: regress, cannot overtake the whole eternity that has elapsed. Grant
12710: that it has a beginning, it is then too small for the conception of the
12711: understanding. For, as a beginning presupposes a time preceding, it
12712: cannot be unconditioned; and the law of the empirical employment of the
12713: understanding imposes the necessity of looking for a higher condition
12714: of time; and the world is, therefore, evidently too small for this law.
12715: 
12716: The same is the case with the double answer to the question regarding
12717: the extent, in space, of the world. For, if it is infinite and
12718: unlimited, it must be too large for every possible empirical
12719: conception. If it is finite and limited, we have a right to ask: “What
12720: determines these limits?” Void space is not a self-subsistent correlate
12721: of things, and cannot be a final condition—and still less an empirical
12722: condition, forming a part of a possible experience. For how can we have
12723: any experience or perception of an absolute void? But the absolute
12724: totality of the empirical synthesis requires that the unconditioned be
12725: an empirical conception. Consequently, a finite world is too small for
12726: our conception.
12727: 
12728: Secondly, if every phenomenon (matter) in space consists of an infinite
12729: number of parts, the regress of the division is always too great for
12730: our conception; and if the division of space must cease with some
12731: member of the division (the simple), it is too small for the idea of
12732: the unconditioned. For the member at which we have discontinued our
12733: division still admits a regress to many more parts contained in the
12734: object.
12735: 
12736: Thirdly, suppose that every event in the world happens in accordance
12737: with the laws of nature; the causality of a cause must itself be an
12738: event and necessitates a regress to a still higher cause, and
12739: consequently the unceasing prolongation of the series of conditions a
12740: parte priori. Operative nature is therefore too large for every
12741: conception we can form in the synthesis of cosmical events.
12742: 
12743: If we admit the existence of spontaneously produced events, that is, of
12744: free agency, we are driven, in our search for sufficient reasons, on an
12745: unavoidable law of nature and are compelled to appeal to the empirical
12746: law of causality, and we find that any such totality of connection in
12747: our synthesis is too small for our necessary empirical conception.
12748: 
12749: Fourthly, if we assume the existence of an absolutely necessary
12750: being—whether it be the world or something in the world, or the cause
12751: of the world—we must place it in a time at an infinite distance from
12752: any given moment; for, otherwise, it must be dependent on some other
12753: and higher existence. Such an existence is, in this case, too large for
12754: our empirical conception, and unattainable by the continued regress of
12755: any synthesis.
12756: 
12757: But if we believe that everything in the world—be it condition or
12758: conditioned—is contingent; every given existence is too small for our
12759: conception. For in this case we are compelled to seek for some other
12760: existence upon which the former depends.
12761: 
12762: We have said that in all these cases the cosmological idea is either
12763: too great or too small for the empirical regress in a synthesis, and
12764: consequently for every possible conception of the understanding. Why
12765: did we not express ourselves in a manner exactly the reverse of this
12766: and, instead of accusing the cosmological idea of over stepping or of
12767: falling short of its true aim, possible experience, say that, in the
12768: first case, the empirical conception is always too small for the idea,
12769: and in the second too great, and thus attach the blame of these
12770: contradictions to the empirical regress? The reason is this. Possible
12771: experience can alone give reality to our conceptions; without it a
12772: conception is merely an idea, without truth or relation to an object.
12773: Hence a possible empirical conception must be the standard by which we
12774: are to judge whether an idea is anything more than an idea and fiction
12775: of thought, or whether it relates to an object in the world. If we say
12776: of a thing that in relation to some other thing it is too large or too
12777: small, the former is considered as existing for the sake of the latter,
12778: and requiring to be adapted to it. Among the trivial subjects of
12779: discussion in the old schools of dialectics was this question: “If a
12780: ball cannot pass through a hole, shall we say that the ball is too
12781: large or the hole too small?” In this case it is indifferent what
12782: expression we employ; for we do not know which exists for the sake of
12783: the other. On the other hand, we cannot say: “The man is too long for
12784: his coat”; but: “The coat is too short for the man.”
12785: 
12786: We are thus led to the well-founded suspicion that the cosmological
12787: ideas, and all the conflicting sophistical assertions connected with
12788: them, are based upon a false and fictitious conception of the mode in
12789: which the object of these ideas is presented to us; and this suspicion
12790: will probably direct us how to expose the illusion that has so long led
12791: us astray from the truth.
12792: 
12793: Section VI. Transcendental Idealism as the Key to the Solution of Pure
12794: Cosmological Dialectic
12795: 
12796: In the transcendental æsthetic we proved that everything intuited in
12797: space and time, all objects of a possible experience, are nothing but
12798: phenomena, that is, mere representations; and that these, as presented
12799: to us—as extended bodies, or as series of changes—have no
12800: self-subsistent existence apart from human thought. This doctrine I
12801: call Transcendental Idealism.[59] The realist in the transcendental
12802: sense regards these modifications of our sensibility, these mere
12803: representations, as things subsisting in themselves.
12804: 
12805:  [59] I have elsewhere termed this theory formal idealism, to
12806:  distinguish it from material idealism, which doubts or denies the
12807:  existence of external things. To avoid ambiguity, it seems advisable
12808:  in many cases to employ this term instead of that mentioned in the
12809:  text.
12810: 
12811: 
12812: It would be unjust to accuse us of holding the long-decried theory of
12813: empirical idealism, which, while admitting the reality of space,
12814: denies, or at least doubts, the existence of bodies extended in it, and
12815: thus leaves us without a sufficient criterion of reality and illusion.
12816: The supporters of this theory find no difficulty in admitting the
12817: reality of the phenomena of the internal sense in time; nay, they go
12818: the length of maintaining that this internal experience is of itself a
12819: sufficient proof of the real existence of its object as a thing in
12820: itself.
12821: 
12822: Transcendental idealism allows that the objects of external
12823: intuition—as intuited in space, and all changes in time—as represented
12824: by the internal sense, are real. For, as space is the form of that
12825: intuition which we call external, and, without objects in space, no
12826: empirical representation could be given us, we can and ought to regard
12827: extended bodies in it as real. The case is the same with
12828: representations in time. But time and space, with all phenomena
12829: therein, are not in themselves things. They are nothing but
12830: representations and cannot exist out of and apart from the mind. Nay,
12831: the sensuous internal intuition of the mind (as the object of
12832: consciousness), the determination of which is represented by the
12833: succession of different states in time, is not the real, proper self,
12834: as it exists in itself—not the transcendental subject—but only a
12835: phenomenon, which is presented to the sensibility of this, to us,
12836: unknown being. This internal phenomenon cannot be admitted to be a
12837: self-subsisting thing; for its condition is time, and time cannot be
12838: the condition of a thing in itself. But the empirical truth of
12839: phenomena in space and time is guaranteed beyond the possibility of
12840: doubt, and sufficiently distinguished from the illusion of dreams or
12841: fancy—although both have a proper and thorough connection in an
12842: experience according to empirical laws. The objects of experience then
12843: are not things in themselves, but are given only in experience, and
12844: have no existence apart from and independently of experience. That
12845: there may be inhabitants in the moon, although no one has ever observed
12846: them, must certainly be admitted; but this assertion means only, that
12847: we may in the possible progress of experience discover them at some
12848: future time. For that which stands in connection with a perception
12849: according to the laws of the progress of experience is real. They are
12850: therefore really existent, if they stand in empirical connection with
12851: my actual or real consciousness, although they are not in themselves
12852: real, that is, apart from the progress of experience.
12853: 
12854: There is nothing actually given—we can be conscious of nothing as real,
12855: except a perception and the empirical progression from it to other
12856: possible perceptions. For phenomena, as mere representations, are real
12857: only in perception; and perception is, in fact, nothing but the reality
12858: of an empirical representation, that is, a phenomenon. To call a
12859: phenomenon a real thing prior to perception means either that we must
12860: meet with this phenomenon in the progress of experience, or it means
12861: nothing at all. For I can say only of a thing in itself that it exists
12862: without relation to the senses and experience. But we are speaking here
12863: merely of phenomena in space and time, both of which are determinations
12864: of sensibility, and not of things in themselves. It follows that
12865: phenomena are not things in themselves, but are mere representations,
12866: which if not given in us—in perception—are non-existent.
12867: 
12868: The faculty of sensuous intuition is properly a receptivity—a capacity
12869: of being affected in a certain manner by representations, the relation
12870: of which to each other is a pure intuition of space and time—the pure
12871: forms of sensibility. These representations, in so far as they are
12872: connected and determinable in this relation (in space and time)
12873: according to laws of the unity of experience, are called objects. The
12874: non-sensuous cause of these representations is completely unknown to us
12875: and hence cannot be intuited as an object. For such an object could not
12876: be represented either in space or in time; and without these conditions
12877: intuition or representation is impossible. We may, at the same time,
12878: term the non-sensuous cause of phenomena the transcendental object—but
12879: merely as a mental correlate to sensibility, considered as a
12880: receptivity. To this transcendental object we may attribute the whole
12881: connection and extent of our possible perceptions, and say that it is
12882: given and exists in itself prior to all experience. But the phenomena,
12883: corresponding to it, are not given as things in themselves, but in
12884: experience alone. For they are mere representations, receiving from
12885: perceptions alone significance and relation to a real object, under the
12886: condition that this or that perception—indicating an object—is in
12887: complete connection with all others in accordance with the rules of the
12888: unity of experience. Thus we can say: “The things that really existed
12889: in past time are given in the transcendental object of experience.” But
12890: these are to me real objects, only in so far as I can represent to my
12891: own mind, that a regressive series of possible perceptions—following
12892: the indications of history, or the footsteps of cause and effect—in
12893: accordance with empirical laws—that, in one word, the course of the
12894: world conducts us to an elapsed series of time as the condition of the
12895: present time. This series in past time is represented as real, not in
12896: itself, but only in connection with a possible experience. Thus, when I
12897: say that certain events occurred in past time, I merely assert the
12898: possibility of prolonging the chain of experience, from the present
12899: perception, upwards to the conditions that determine it according to
12900: time.
12901: 
12902: If I represent to myself all objects existing in all space and time, I
12903: do not thereby place these in space and time prior to all experience;
12904: on the contrary, such a representation is nothing more than the notion
12905: of a possible experience, in its absolute completeness. In experience
12906: alone are those objects, which are nothing but representations, given.
12907: But, when I say they existed prior to my experience, this means only
12908: that I must begin with the perception present to me and follow the
12909: track indicated until I discover them in some part or region of
12910: experience. The cause of the empirical condition of this
12911: progression—and consequently at what member therein I must stop, and at
12912: what point in the regress I am to find this member—is transcendental,
12913: and hence necessarily incognizable. But with this we have not to do;
12914: our concern is only with the law of progression in experience, in which
12915: objects, that is, phenomena, are given. It is a matter of indifference,
12916: whether I say, “I may in the progress of experience discover stars, at
12917: a hundred times greater distance than the most distant of those now
12918: visible,” or, “Stars at this distance may be met in space, although no
12919: one has, or ever will discover them.” For, if they are given as things
12920: in themselves, without any relation to possible experience, they are
12921: for me non-existent, consequently, are not objects, for they are not
12922: contained in the regressive series of experience. But, if these
12923: phenomena must be employed in the construction or support of the
12924: cosmological idea of an absolute whole, and when we are discussing a
12925: question that oversteps the limits of possible experience, the proper
12926: distinction of the different theories of the reality of sensuous
12927: objects is of great importance, in order to avoid the illusion which
12928: must necessarily arise from the misinterpretation of our empirical
12929: conceptions.
12930: 
12931: Section VII. Critical Solution of the Cosmological Problem
12932: 
12933: The antinomy of pure reason is based upon the following dialectical
12934: argument: “If that which is conditioned is given, the whole series of
12935: its conditions is also given; but sensuous objects are given as
12936: conditioned; consequently...” This syllogism, the major of which seems
12937: so natural and evident, introduces as many cosmological ideas as there
12938: are different kinds of conditions in the synthesis of phenomena, in so
12939: far as these conditions constitute a series. These ideas require
12940: absolute totality in the series, and thus place reason in inextricable
12941: embarrassment. Before proceeding to expose the fallacy in this
12942: dialectical argument, it will be necessary to have a correct
12943: understanding of certain conceptions that appear in it.
12944: 
12945: In the first place, the following proposition is evident, and
12946: indubitably certain: “If the conditioned is given, a regress in the
12947: series of all its conditions is thereby imperatively required.” For the
12948: very conception of a conditioned is a conception of something related
12949: to a condition, and, if this condition is itself conditioned, to
12950: another condition—and so on through all the members of the series. This
12951: proposition is, therefore, analytical and has nothing to fear from
12952: transcendental criticism. It is a logical postulate of reason: to
12953: pursue, as far as possible, the connection of a conception with its
12954: conditions.
12955: 
12956: If, in the second place, both the conditioned and the condition are
12957: things in themselves, and if the former is given, not only is the
12958: regress to the latter requisite, but the latter is really given with
12959: the former. Now, as this is true of all the members of the series, the
12960: entire series of conditions, and with them the unconditioned, is at the
12961: same time given in the very fact of the conditioned, the existence of
12962: which is possible only in and through that series, being given. In this
12963: case, the synthesis of the conditioned with its condition, is a
12964: synthesis of the understanding merely, which represents things as they
12965: are, without regarding whether and how we can cognize them. But if I
12966: have to do with phenomena, which, in their character of mere
12967: representations, are not given, if I do not attain to a cognition of
12968: them (in other words, to themselves, for they are nothing more than
12969: empirical cognitions), I am not entitled to say: “If the conditioned is
12970: given, all its conditions (as phenomena) are also given.” I cannot,
12971: therefore, from the fact of a conditioned being given, infer the
12972: absolute totality of the series of its conditions. For phenomena are
12973: nothing but an empirical synthesis in apprehension or perception, and
12974: are therefore given only in it. Now, in speaking of phenomena it does
12975: not follow that, if the conditioned is given, the synthesis which
12976: constitutes its empirical condition is also thereby given and
12977: presupposed; such a synthesis can be established only by an actual
12978: regress in the series of conditions. But we are entitled to say in this
12979: case that a regress to the conditions of a conditioned, in other words,
12980: that a continuous empirical synthesis is enjoined; that, if the
12981: conditions are not given, they are at least required; and that we are
12982: certain to discover the conditions in this regress.
12983: 
12984: We can now see that the major, in the above cosmological syllogism,
12985: takes the conditioned in the transcendental signification which it has
12986: in the pure category, while the minor speaks of it in the empirical
12987: signification which it has in the category as applied to phenomena.
12988: There is, therefore, a dialectical fallacy in the syllogism—a sophisma
12989: figurae dictionis. But this fallacy is not a consciously devised one,
12990: but a perfectly natural illusion of the common reason of man. For, when
12991: a thing is given as conditioned, we presuppose in the major its
12992: conditions and their series, unperceived, as it were, and unseen;
12993: because this is nothing more than the logical requirement of complete
12994: and satisfactory premisses for a given conclusion. In this case, time
12995: is altogether left out in the connection of the conditioned with the
12996: condition; they are supposed to be given in themselves, and
12997: contemporaneously. It is, moreover, just as natural to regard phenomena
12998: (in the minor) as things in themselves and as objects presented to the
12999: pure understanding, as in the major, in which complete abstraction was
13000: made of all conditions of intuition. But it is under these conditions
13001: alone that objects are given. Now we overlooked a remarkable
13002: distinction between the conceptions. The synthesis of the conditioned
13003: with its condition, and the complete series of the latter (in the
13004: major) are not limited by time, and do not contain the conception of
13005: succession. On the contrary, the empirical synthesis and the series of
13006: conditions in the phenomenal world—subsumed in the minor—are
13007: necessarily successive and given in time alone. It follows that I
13008: cannot presuppose in the minor, as I did in the major, the absolute
13009: totality of the synthesis and of the series therein represented; for in
13010: the major all the members of the series are given as things in
13011: themselves—without any limitations or conditions of time, while in the
13012: minor they are possible only in and through a successive regress, which
13013: cannot exist, except it be actually carried into execution in the world
13014: of phenomena.
13015: 
13016: After this proof of the viciousness of the argument commonly employed
13017: in maintaining cosmological assertions, both parties may now be justly
13018: dismissed, as advancing claims without grounds or title. But the
13019: process has not been ended by convincing them that one or both were in
13020: the wrong and had maintained an assertion which was without valid
13021: grounds of proof. Nothing seems to be clearer than that, if one
13022: maintains: “The world has a beginning,” and another: “The world has no
13023: beginning,” one of the two must be right. But it is likewise clear
13024: that, if the evidence on both sides is equal, it is impossible to
13025: discover on what side the truth lies; and the controversy continues,
13026: although the parties have been recommended to peace before the tribunal
13027: of reason. There remains, then, no other means of settling the question
13028: than to convince the parties, who refute each other with such
13029: conclusiveness and ability, that they are disputing about nothing, and
13030: that a transcendental illusion has been mocking them with visions of
13031: reality where there is none. The mode of adjusting a dispute which
13032: cannot be decided upon its own merits, we shall now proceed to lay
13033: before our readers.
13034: 
13035: 
13036: Zeno of Elea, a subtle dialectician, was severely reprimanded by Plato
13037: as a sophist, who, merely from the base motive of exhibiting his skill
13038: in discussion, maintained and subverted the same proposition by
13039: arguments as powerful and convincing on the one side as on the other.
13040: He maintained, for example, that God (who was probably nothing more, in
13041: his view, than the world) is neither finite nor infinite, neither in
13042: motion nor in rest, neither similar nor dissimilar to any other thing.
13043: It seemed to those philosophers who criticized his mode of discussion
13044: that his purpose was to deny completely both of two self-contradictory
13045: propositions—which is absurd. But I cannot believe that there is any
13046: justice in this accusation. The first of these propositions I shall
13047: presently consider in a more detailed manner. With regard to the
13048: others, if by the word of God he understood merely the Universe, his
13049: meaning must have been—that it cannot be permanently present in one
13050: place—that is, at rest—nor be capable of changing its place—that is, of
13051: moving—because all places are in the universe, and the universe itself
13052: is, therefore, in no place. Again, if the universe contains in itself
13053: everything that exists, it cannot be similar or dissimilar to any other
13054: thing, because there is, in fact, no other thing with which it can be
13055: compared. If two opposite judgements presuppose a contingent
13056: impossible, or arbitrary condition, both—in spite of their opposition
13057: (which is, however, not properly or really a contradiction)—fall away;
13058: because the condition, which ensured the validity of both, has itself
13059: disappeared.
13060: 
13061: If we say: “Everybody has either a good or a bad smell,” we have
13062: omitted a third possible judgement—it has no smell at all; and thus
13063: both conflicting statements may be false. If we say: “It is either
13064: good-smelling or not good-smelling (vel suaveolens vel
13065: non-suaveolens),” both judgements are contradictorily opposed; and the
13066: contradictory opposite of the former judgement—some bodies are not
13067: good-smelling—embraces also those bodies which have no smell at all. In
13068: the preceding pair of opposed judgements (per disparata), the
13069: contingent condition of the conception of body (smell) attached to both
13070: conflicting statements, instead of having been omitted in the latter,
13071: which is consequently not the contradictory opposite of the former.
13072: 
13073: If, accordingly, we say: “The world is either infinite in extension, or
13074: it is not infinite (non est infinitus)”; and if the former proposition
13075: is false, its contradictory opposite—the world is not infinite—must be
13076: true. And thus I should deny the existence of an infinite, without,
13077: however affirming the existence of a finite world. But if we construct
13078: our proposition thus: “The world is either infinite or finite
13079: (non-infinite),” both statements may be false. For, in this case, we
13080: consider the world as per se determined in regard to quantity, and
13081: while, in the one judgement, we deny its infinite and consequently,
13082: perhaps, its independent existence; in the other, we append to the
13083: world, regarded as a thing in itself, a certain determination—that of
13084: finitude; and the latter may be false as well as the former, if the
13085: world is not given as a thing in itself, and thus neither as finite nor
13086: as infinite in quantity. This kind of opposition I may be allowed to
13087: term dialectical; that of contradictories may be called analytical
13088: opposition. Thus then, of two dialectically opposed judgements both may
13089: be false, from the fact, that the one is not a mere contradictory of
13090: the other, but actually enounces more than is requisite for a full and
13091: complete contradiction.
13092: 
13093: When we regard the two propositions—“The world is infinite in
13094: quantity,” and, “The world is finite in quantity,” as contradictory
13095: opposites, we are assuming that the world—the complete series of
13096: phenomena—is a thing in itself. For it remains as a permanent quantity,
13097: whether I deny the infinite or the finite regress in the series of its
13098: phenomena. But if we dismiss this assumption—this transcendental
13099: illusion—and deny that it is a thing in itself, the contradictory
13100: opposition is metamorphosed into a merely dialectical one; and the
13101: world, as not existing in itself—independently of the regressive series
13102: of my representations—exists in like manner neither as a whole which is
13103: infinite nor as a whole which is finite in itself. The universe exists
13104: for me only in the empirical regress of the series of phenomena and not
13105: per se. If, then, it is always conditioned, it is never completely or
13106: as a whole; and it is, therefore, not an unconditioned whole and does
13107: not exist as such, either with an infinite, or with a finite quantity.
13108: 
13109: What we have here said of the first cosmological idea—that of the
13110: absolute totality of quantity in phenomena—applies also to the others.
13111: The series of conditions is discoverable only in the regressive
13112: synthesis itself, and not in the phenomenon considered as a thing in
13113: itself—given prior to all regress. Hence I am compelled to say: “The
13114: aggregate of parts in a given phenomenon is in itself neither finite
13115: nor infinite; and these parts are given only in the regressive
13116: synthesis of decomposition—a synthesis which is never given in absolute
13117: completeness, either as finite, or as infinite.” The same is the case
13118: with the series of subordinated causes, or of the conditioned up to the
13119: unconditioned and necessary existence, which can never be regarded as
13120: in itself, and in its totality, either as finite or as infinite;
13121: because, as a series of subordinate representations, it subsists only
13122: in the dynamical regress and cannot be regarded as existing previously
13123: to this regress, or as a self-subsistent series of things.
13124: 
13125: Thus the antinomy of pure reason in its cosmological ideas disappears.
13126: For the above demonstration has established the fact that it is merely
13127: the product of a dialectical and illusory opposition, which arises from
13128: the application of the idea of absolute totality—admissible only as a
13129: condition of things in themselves—to phenomena, which exist only in our
13130: representations, and—when constituting a series—in a successive
13131: regress. This antinomy of reason may, however, be really profitable to
13132: our speculative interests, not in the way of contributing any
13133: dogmatical addition, but as presenting to us another material support
13134: in our critical investigations. For it furnishes us with an indirect
13135: proof of the transcendental ideality of phenomena, if our minds were
13136: not completely satisfied with the direct proof set forth in the
13137: Trancendental Æsthetic. The proof would proceed in the following
13138: dilemma. If the world is a whole existing in itself, it must be either
13139: finite or infinite. But it is neither finite nor infinite—as has been
13140: shown, on the one side, by the thesis, on the other, by the antithesis.
13141: Therefore the world—the content of all phenomena—is not a whole
13142: existing in itself. It follows that phenomena are nothing, apart from
13143: our representations. And this is what we mean by transcendental
13144: ideality.
13145: 
13146: This remark is of some importance. It enables us to see that the proofs
13147: of the fourfold antinomy are not mere sophistries—are not fallacious,
13148: but grounded on the nature of reason, and valid—under the supposition
13149: that phenomena are things in themselves. The opposition of the
13150: judgements which follow makes it evident that a fallacy lay in the
13151: initial supposition, and thus helps us to discover the true
13152: constitution of objects of sense. This transcendental dialectic does
13153: not favour scepticism, although it presents us with a triumphant
13154: demonstration of the advantages of the sceptical method, the great
13155: utility of which is apparent in the antinomy, where the arguments of
13156: reason were allowed to confront each other in undiminished force. And
13157: although the result of these conflicts of reason is not what we
13158: expected—although we have obtained no positive dogmatical addition to
13159: metaphysical science—we have still reaped a great advantage in the
13160: correction of our judgements on these subjects of thought.
13161: 
13162: Section VIII. Regulative Principle of Pure Reason in relation to the
13163: Cosmological Ideas
13164: 
13165: The cosmological principle of totality could not give us any certain
13166: knowledge in regard to the maximum in the series of conditions in the
13167: world of sense, considered as a thing in itself. The actual regress in
13168: the series is the only means of approaching this maximum. This
13169: principle of pure reason, therefore, may still be considered as
13170: valid—not as an axiom enabling us to cogitate totality in the object as
13171: actual, but as a problem for the understanding, which requires it to
13172: institute and to continue, in conformity with the idea of totality in
13173: the mind, the regress in the series of the conditions of a given
13174: conditioned. For in the world of sense, that is, in space and time,
13175: every condition which we discover in our investigation of phenomena is
13176: itself conditioned; because sensuous objects are not things in
13177: themselves (in which case an absolutely unconditioned might be reached
13178: in the progress of cognition), but are merely empirical representations
13179: the conditions of which must always be found in intuition. The
13180: principle of reason is therefore properly a mere rule—prescribing a
13181: regress in the series of conditions for given phenomena, and
13182: prohibiting any pause or rest on an absolutely unconditioned. It is,
13183: therefore, not a principle of the possibility of experience or of the
13184: empirical cognition of sensuous objects—consequently not a principle of
13185: the understanding; for every experience is confined within certain
13186: proper limits determined by the given intuition. Still less is it a
13187: constitutive principle of reason authorizing us to extend our
13188: conception of the sensuous world beyond all possible experience. It is
13189: merely a principle for the enlargement and extension of experience as
13190: far as is possible for human faculties. It forbids us to consider any
13191: empirical limits as absolute. It is, hence, a principle of reason,
13192: which, as a rule, dictates how we ought to proceed in our empirical
13193: regress, but is unable to anticipate or indicate prior to the empirical
13194: regress what is given in the object itself. I have termed it for this
13195: reason a regulative principle of reason; while the principle of the
13196: absolute totality of the series of conditions, as existing in itself
13197: and given in the object, is a constitutive cosmological principle. This
13198: distinction will at once demonstrate the falsehood of the constitutive
13199: principle, and prevent us from attributing (by a transcendental
13200: subreptio) objective reality to an idea, which is valid only as a rule.
13201: 
13202: In order to understand the proper meaning of this rule of pure reason,
13203: we must notice first that it cannot tell us what the object is, but
13204: only how the empirical regress is to be proceeded with in order to
13205: attain to the complete conception of the object. If it gave us any
13206: information in respect to the former statement, it would be a
13207: constitutive principle—a principle impossible from the nature of pure
13208: reason. It will not therefore enable us to establish any such
13209: conclusions as: “The series of conditions for a given conditioned is in
13210: itself finite,” or, “It is infinite.” For, in this case, we should be
13211: cogitating in the mere idea of absolute totality, an object which is
13212: not and cannot be given in experience; inasmuch as we should be
13213: attributing a reality objective and independent of the empirical
13214: synthesis, to a series of phenomena. This idea of reason cannot then be
13215: regarded as valid—except as a rule for the regressive synthesis in the
13216: series of conditions, according to which we must proceed from the
13217: conditioned, through all intermediate and subordinate conditions, up to
13218: the unconditioned; although this goal is unattained and unattainable.
13219: For the absolutely unconditioned cannot be discovered in the sphere of
13220: experience.
13221: 
13222: We now proceed to determine clearly our notion of a synthesis which can
13223: never be complete. There are two terms commonly employed for this
13224: purpose. These terms are regarded as expressions of different and
13225: distinguishable notions, although the ground of the distinction has
13226: never been clearly exposed. The term employed by the mathematicians is
13227: progressus in infinitum. The philosophers prefer the expression
13228: progressus in indefinitum. Without detaining the reader with an
13229: examination of the reasons for such a distinction, or with remarks on
13230: the right or wrong use of the terms, I shall endeavour clearly to
13231: determine these conceptions, so far as is necessary for the purpose in
13232: this Critique.
13233: 
13234: We may, with propriety, say of a straight line, that it may be produced
13235: to infinity. In this case the distinction between a progressus in
13236: infinitum and a progressus in indefinitum is a mere piece of subtlety.
13237: For, although when we say, “Produce a straight line,” it is more
13238: correct to say in indefinitum than in infinitum; because the former
13239: means, “Produce it as far as you please,” the second, “You must not
13240: cease to produce it”; the expression in infinitum is, when we are
13241: speaking of the power to do it, perfectly correct, for we can always
13242: make it longer if we please—on to infinity. And this remark holds good
13243: in all cases, when we speak of a progressus, that is, an advancement
13244: from the condition to the conditioned; this possible advancement always
13245: proceeds to infinity. We may proceed from a given pair in the
13246: descending line of generation from father to son, and cogitate a
13247: never-ending line of descendants from it. For in such a case reason
13248: does not demand absolute totality in the series, because it does not
13249: presuppose it as a condition and as given (datum), but merely as
13250: conditioned, and as capable of being given (dabile).
13251: 
13252: Very different is the case with the problem: “How far the regress,
13253: which ascends from the given conditioned to the conditions, must
13254: extend”; whether I can say: “It is a regress in infinitum,” or only “in
13255: indefinitum”; and whether, for example, setting out from the human
13256: beings at present alive in the world, I may ascend in the series of
13257: their ancestors, in infinitum—or whether all that can be said is, that
13258: so far as I have proceeded, I have discovered no empirical ground for
13259: considering the series limited, so that I am justified, and indeed,
13260: compelled to search for ancestors still further back, although I am not
13261: obliged by the idea of reason to presuppose them.
13262: 
13263: My answer to this question is: “If the series is given in empirical
13264: intuition as a whole, the regress in the series of its internal
13265: conditions proceeds in infinitum; but, if only one member of the series
13266: is given, from which the regress is to proceed to absolute totality,
13267: the regress is possible only in indefinitum.” For example, the division
13268: of a portion of matter given within certain limits—of a body, that
13269: is—proceeds in infinitum. For, as the condition of this whole is its
13270: part, and the condition of the part a part of the part, and so on, and
13271: as in this regress of decomposition an unconditioned indivisible member
13272: of the series of conditions is not to be found; there are no reasons or
13273: grounds in experience for stopping in the division, but, on the
13274: contrary, the more remote members of the division are actually and
13275: empirically given prior to this division. That is to say, the division
13276: proceeds to infinity. On the other hand, the series of ancestors of any
13277: given human being is not given, in its absolute totality, in any
13278: experience, and yet the regress proceeds from every genealogical member
13279: of this series to one still higher, and does not meet with any
13280: empirical limit presenting an absolutely unconditioned member of the
13281: series. But as the members of such a series are not contained in the
13282: empirical intuition of the whole, prior to the regress, this regress
13283: does not proceed to infinity, but only in indefinitum, that is, we are
13284: called upon to discover other and higher members, which are themselves
13285: always conditioned.
13286: 
13287: In neither case—the regressus in infinitum, nor the regressus in
13288: indefinitum, is the series of conditions to be considered as actually
13289: infinite in the object itself. This might be true of things in
13290: themselves, but it cannot be asserted of phenomena, which, as
13291: conditions of each other, are only given in the empirical regress
13292: itself. Hence, the question no longer is, “What is the quantity of this
13293: series of conditions in itself—is it finite or infinite?” for it is
13294: nothing in itself; but, “How is the empirical regress to be commenced,
13295: and how far ought we to proceed with it?” And here a signal distinction
13296: in the application of this rule becomes apparent. If the whole is given
13297: empirically, it is possible to recede in the series of its internal
13298: conditions to infinity. But if the whole is not given, and can only be
13299: given by and through the empirical regress, I can only say: “It is
13300: possible to infinity, to proceed to still higher conditions in the
13301: series.” In the first case, I am justified in asserting that more
13302: members are empirically given in the object than I attain to in the
13303: regress (of decomposition). In the second case, I am justified only in
13304: saying, that I can always proceed further in the regress, because no
13305: member of the series is given as absolutely conditioned, and thus a
13306: higher member is possible, and an inquiry with regard to it is
13307: necessary. In the one case it is necessary to find other members of the
13308: series, in the other it is necessary to inquire for others, inasmuch as
13309: experience presents no absolute limitation of the regress. For, either
13310: you do not possess a perception which absolutely limits your empirical
13311: regress, and in this case the regress cannot be regarded as complete;
13312: or, you do possess such a limitative perception, in which case it is
13313: not a part of your series (for that which limits must be distinct from
13314: that which is limited by it), and it is incumbent you to continue your
13315: regress up to this condition, and so on.
13316: 
13317: These remarks will be placed in their proper light by their application
13318: in the following section.
13319: 
13320: Section IX. Of the Empirical Use of the Regulative Principle of Reason
13321: with regard to the Cosmological Ideas
13322: 
13323: We have shown that no transcendental use can be made either of the
13324: conceptions of reason or of understanding. We have shown, likewise,
13325: that the demand of absolute totality in the series of conditions in the
13326: world of sense arises from a transcendental employment of reason,
13327: resting on the opinion that phenomena are to be regarded as things in
13328: themselves. It follows that we are not required to answer the question
13329: respecting the absolute quantity of a series—whether it is in itself
13330: limited or unlimited. We are only called upon to determine how far we
13331: must proceed in the empirical regress from condition to condition, in
13332: order to discover, in conformity with the rule of reason, a full and
13333: correct answer to the questions proposed by reason itself.
13334: 
13335: This principle of reason is hence valid only as a rule for the
13336: extension of a possible experience—its invalidity as a principle
13337: constitutive of phenomena in themselves having been sufficiently
13338: demonstrated. And thus, too, the antinomial conflict of reason with
13339: itself is completely put an end to; inasmuch as we have not only
13340: presented a critical solution of the fallacy lurking in the opposite
13341: statements of reason, but have shown the true meaning of the ideas
13342: which gave rise to these statements. The dialectical principle of
13343: reason has, therefore, been changed into a doctrinal principle. But in
13344: fact, if this principle, in the subjective signification which we have
13345: shown to be its only true sense, may be guaranteed as a principle of
13346: the unceasing extension of the employment of our understanding, its
13347: influence and value are just as great as if it were an axiom for the à
13348: priori determination of objects. For such an axiom could not exert a
13349: stronger influence on the extension and rectification of our knowledge,
13350: otherwise than by procuring for the principles of the understanding the
13351: most widely expanded employment in the field of experience.
13352: 
13353: I. Solution of the Cosmological Idea of the Totality of the Composition
13354: of Phenomena in the Universe
13355: 
13356: Here, as well as in the case of the other cosmological problems, the
13357: ground of the regulative principle of reason is the proposition that in
13358: our empirical regress no experience of an absolute limit, and
13359: consequently no experience of a condition, which is itself absolutely
13360: unconditioned, is discoverable. And the truth of this proposition
13361: itself rests upon the consideration that such an experience must
13362: represent to us phenomena as limited by nothing or the mere void, on
13363: which our continued regress by means of perception must abut—which is
13364: impossible.
13365: 
13366: Now this proposition, which declares that every condition attained in
13367: the empirical regress must itself be considered empirically
13368: conditioned, contains the rule in terminis, which requires me, to
13369: whatever extent I may have proceeded in the ascending series, always to
13370: look for some higher member in the series—whether this member is to
13371: become known to me through experience, or not.
13372: 
13373: Nothing further is necessary, then, for the solution of the first
13374: cosmological problem, than to decide, whether, in the regress to the
13375: unconditioned quantity of the universe (as regards space and time),
13376: this never limited ascent ought to be called a regressus in infinitum
13377: or indefinitum.
13378: 
13379: The general representation which we form in our minds of the series of
13380: all past states or conditions of the world, or of all the things which
13381: at present exist in it, is itself nothing more than a possible
13382: empirical regress, which is cogitated—although in an undetermined
13383: manner—in the mind, and which gives rise to the conception of a series
13384: of conditions for a given object.[60] Now I have a conception of the
13385: universe, but not an intuition—that is, not an intuition of it as a
13386: whole. Thus I cannot infer the magnitude of the regress from the
13387: quantity or magnitude of the world, and determine the former by means
13388: of the latter; on the contrary, I must first of all form a conception
13389: of the quantity or magnitude of the world from the magnitude of the
13390: empirical regress. But of this regress I know nothing more than that I
13391: ought to proceed from every given member of the series of conditions to
13392: one still higher. But the quantity of the universe is not thereby
13393: determined, and we cannot affirm that this regress proceeds in
13394: infinitum. Such an affirmation would anticipate the members of the
13395: series which have not yet been reached, and represent the number of
13396: them as beyond the grasp of any empirical synthesis; it would
13397: consequently determine the cosmical quantity prior to the regress
13398: (although only in a negative manner)—which is impossible. For the world
13399: is not given in its totality in any intuition: consequently, its
13400: quantity cannot be given prior to the regress. It follows that we are
13401: unable to make any declaration respecting the cosmical quantity in
13402: itself—not even that the regress in it is a regress in infinitum; we
13403: must only endeavour to attain to a conception of the quantity of the
13404: universe, in conformity with the rule which determines the empirical
13405: regress in it. But this rule merely requires us never to admit an
13406: absolute limit to our series—how far soever we may have proceeded in
13407: it, but always, on the contrary, to subordinate every phenomenon to
13408: some other as its condition, and consequently to proceed to this higher
13409: phenomenon. Such a regress is, therefore, the regressus in indefinitum,
13410: which, as not determining a quantity in the object, is clearly
13411: distinguishable from the regressus in infinitum.
13412: 
13413:  [60] The cosmical series can neither be greater nor smaller than the
13414:  possible empirical regress, upon which its conception is based. And as
13415:  this regress cannot be a determinate infinite regress, still less a
13416:  determinate finite (absolutely limited), it is evident that we cannot
13417:  regard the world as either finite or infinite, because the regress,
13418:  which gives us the representation of the world, is neither finite nor
13419:  infinite.
13420: 
13421: 
13422: It follows from what we have said that we are not justified in
13423: declaring the world to be infinite in space, or as regards past time.
13424: For this conception of an infinite given quantity is empirical; but we
13425: cannot apply the conception of an infinite quantity to the world as an
13426: object of the senses. I cannot say, “The regress from a given
13427: perception to everything limited either in space or time, proceeds in
13428: infinitum,” for this presupposes an infinite cosmical quantity; neither
13429: can I say, “It is finite,” for an absolute limit is likewise impossible
13430: in experience. It follows that I am not entitled to make any assertion
13431: at all respecting the whole object of experience—the world of sense; I
13432: must limit my declarations to the rule according to which experience or
13433: empirical knowledge is to be attained.
13434: 
13435: To the question, therefore, respecting the cosmical quantity, the first
13436: and negative answer is: “The world has no beginning in time, and no
13437: absolute limit in space.”
13438: 
13439: For, in the contrary case, it would be limited by a void time on the
13440: one hand, and by a void space on the other. Now, since the world, as a
13441: phenomenon, cannot be thus limited in itself for a phenomenon is not a
13442: thing in itself; it must be possible for us to have a perception of
13443: this limitation by a void time and a void space. But such a
13444: perception—such an experience is impossible; because it has no content.
13445: Consequently, an absolute cosmical limit is empirically, and therefore
13446: absolutely, impossible.[61]
13447: 
13448:  [61] The reader will remark that the proof presented above is very
13449:  different from the dogmatical demonstration given in the antithesis of
13450:  the first antinomy. In that demonstration, it was taken for granted
13451:  that the world is a thing in itself—given in its totality prior to all
13452:  regress, and a determined position in space and time was denied to
13453:  it—if it was not considered as occupying all time and all space. Hence
13454:  our conclusion differed from that given above; for we inferred in the
13455:  antithesis the actual infinity of the world.
13456: 
13457: 
13458: From this follows the affirmative answer: “The regress in the series of
13459: phenomena—as a determination of the cosmical quantity, proceeds in
13460: indefinitum.” This is equivalent to saying: “The world of sense has no
13461: absolute quantity, but the empirical regress (through which alone the
13462: world of sense is presented to us on the side of its conditions) rests
13463: upon a rule, which requires it to proceed from every member of the
13464: series, as conditioned, to one still more remote (whether through
13465: personal experience, or by means of history, or the chain of cause and
13466: effect), and not to cease at any point in this extension of the
13467: possible empirical employment of the understanding.” And this is the
13468: proper and only use which reason can make of its principles.
13469: 
13470: The above rule does not prescribe an unceasing regress in one kind of
13471: phenomena. It does not, for example, forbid us, in our ascent from an
13472: individual human being through the line of his ancestors, to expect
13473: that we shall discover at some point of the regress a primeval pair, or
13474: to admit, in the series of heavenly bodies, a sun at the farthest
13475: possible distance from some centre. All that it demands is a perpetual
13476: progress from phenomena to phenomena, even although an actual
13477: perception is not presented by them (as in the case of our perceptions
13478: being so weak as that we are unable to become conscious of them), since
13479: they, nevertheless, belong to possible experience.
13480: 
13481: Every beginning is in time, and all limits to extension are in space.
13482: But space and time are in the world of sense. Consequently phenomena in
13483: the world are conditionally limited, but the world itself is not
13484: limited, either conditionally or unconditionally.
13485: 
13486: For this reason, and because neither the world nor the cosmical series
13487: of conditions to a given conditioned can be completely given, our
13488: conception of the cosmical quantity is given only in and through the
13489: regress and not prior to it—in a collective intuition. But the regress
13490: itself is really nothing more than the determining of the cosmical
13491: quantity, and cannot therefore give us any determined conception of
13492: it—still less a conception of a quantity which is, in relation to a
13493: certain standard, infinite. The regress does not, therefore, proceed to
13494: infinity (an infinity given), but only to an indefinite extent, for or
13495: the of presenting to us a quantity—realized only in and through the
13496: regress itself.
13497: 
13498: II. Solution of the Cosmological Idea of the Totality of the Division
13499: of a Whole given in Intuition
13500: 
13501: When I divide a whole which is given in intuition, I proceed from a
13502: conditioned to its conditions. The division of the parts of the whole
13503: (subdivisio or decompositio) is a regress in the series of these
13504: conditions. The absolute totality of this series would be actually
13505: attained and given to the mind, if the regress could arrive at simple
13506: parts. But if all the parts in a continuous decomposition are
13507: themselves divisible, the division, that is to say, the regress,
13508: proceeds from the conditioned to its conditions in infinitum; because
13509: the conditions (the parts) are themselves contained in the conditioned,
13510: and, as the latter is given in a limited intuition, the former are all
13511: given along with it. This regress cannot, therefore, be called a
13512: regressus in indefinitum, as happened in the case of the preceding
13513: cosmological idea, the regress in which proceeded from the conditioned
13514: to the conditions not given contemporaneously and along with it, but
13515: discoverable only through the empirical regress. We are not, however,
13516: entitled to affirm of a whole of this kind, which is divisible in
13517: infinitum, that it consists of an infinite number of parts. For,
13518: although all the parts are contained in the intuition of the whole, the
13519: whole division is not contained therein. The division is contained only
13520: in the progressing decomposition—in the regress itself, which is the
13521: condition of the possibility and actuality of the series. Now, as this
13522: regress is infinite, all the members (parts) to which it attains must
13523: be contained in the given whole as an aggregate. But the complete
13524: series of division is not contained therein. For this series, being
13525: infinite in succession and always incomplete, cannot represent an
13526: infinite number of members, and still less a composition of these
13527: members into a whole.
13528: 
13529: To apply this remark to space. Every limited part of space presented to
13530: intuition is a whole, the parts of which are always spaces—to whatever
13531: extent subdivided. Every limited space is hence divisible to infinity.
13532: 
13533: Let us again apply the remark to an external phenomenon enclosed in
13534: limits, that is, a body. The divisibility of a body rests upon the
13535: divisibility of space, which is the condition of the possibility of the
13536: body as an extended whole. A body is consequently divisible to
13537: infinity, though it does not, for that reason, consist of an infinite
13538: number of parts.
13539: 
13540: It certainly seems that, as a body must be cogitated as substance in
13541: space, the law of divisibility would not be applicable to it as
13542: substance. For we may and ought to grant, in the case of space, that
13543: division or decomposition, to any extent, never can utterly annihilate
13544: composition (that is to say, the smallest part of space must still
13545: consist of spaces); otherwise space would entirely cease to exist—which
13546: is impossible. But, the assertion on the other hand that when all
13547: composition in matter is annihilated in thought, nothing remains, does
13548: not seem to harmonize with the conception of substance, which must be
13549: properly the subject of all composition and must remain, even after the
13550: conjunction of its attributes in space—which constituted a body—is
13551: annihilated in thought. But this is not the case with substance in the
13552: phenomenal world, which is not a thing in itself cogitated by the pure
13553: category. Phenomenal substance is not an absolute subject; it is merely
13554: a permanent sensuous image, and nothing more than an intuition, in
13555: which the unconditioned is not to be found.
13556: 
13557: But, although this rule of progress to infinity is legitimate and
13558: applicable to the subdivision of a phenomenon, as a mere occupation or
13559: filling of space, it is not applicable to a whole consisting of a
13560: number of distinct parts and constituting a quantum discretum—that is
13561: to say, an organized body. It cannot be admitted that every part in an
13562: organized whole is itself organized, and that, in analysing it to
13563: infinity, we must always meet with organized parts; although we may
13564: allow that the parts of the matter which we decompose in infinitum, may
13565: be organized. For the infinity of the division of a phenomenon in space
13566: rests altogether on the fact that the divisibility of a phenomenon is
13567: given only in and through this infinity, that is, an undetermined
13568: number of parts is given, while the parts themselves are given and
13569: determined only in and through the subdivision; in a word, the infinity
13570: of the division necessarily presupposes that the whole is not already
13571: divided in se. Hence our division determines a number of parts in the
13572: whole—a number which extends just as far as the actual regress in the
13573: division; while, on the other hand, the very notion of a body organized
13574: to infinity represents the whole as already and in itself divided. We
13575: expect, therefore, to find in it a determinate, but at the same time,
13576: infinite, number of parts—which is self-contradictory. For we should
13577: thus have a whole containing a series of members which could not be
13578: completed in any regress—which is infinite, and at the same time
13579: complete in an organized composite. Infinite divisibility is applicable
13580: only to a quantum continuum, and is based entirely on the infinite
13581: divisibility of space, But in a quantum discretum the multitude of
13582: parts or units is always determined, and hence always equal to some
13583: number. To what extent a body may be organized, experience alone can
13584: inform us; and although, so far as our experience of this or that body
13585: has extended, we may not have discovered any inorganic part, such parts
13586: must exist in possible experience. But how far the transcendental
13587: division of a phenomenon must extend, we cannot know from experience—it
13588: is a question which experience cannot answer; it is answered only by
13589: the principle of reason which forbids us to consider the empirical
13590: regress, in the analysis of extended body, as ever absolutely complete.
13591: 
13592: Concluding Remark on the Solution of the Transcendental Mathematical
13593: Ideas—and Introductory to the Solution of the Dynamical Ideas.
13594: 
13595: We presented the antinomy of pure reason in a tabular form, and we
13596: endeavoured to show the ground of this self-contradiction on the part
13597: of reason, and the only means of bringing it to a conclusion—namely, by
13598: declaring both contradictory statements to be false. We represented in
13599: these antinomies the conditions of phenomena as belonging to the
13600: conditioned according to relations of space and time—which is the usual
13601: supposition of the common understanding. In this respect, all
13602: dialectical representations of totality, in the series of conditions to
13603: a given conditioned, were perfectly homogeneous. The condition was
13604: always a member of the series along with the conditioned, and thus the
13605: homogeneity of the whole series was assured. In this case the regress
13606: could never be cogitated as complete; or, if this was the case, a
13607: member really conditioned was falsely regarded as a primal member,
13608: consequently as unconditioned. In such an antinomy, therefore, we did
13609: not consider the object, that is, the conditioned, but the series of
13610: conditions belonging to the object, and the magnitude of that series.
13611: And thus arose the difficulty—a difficulty not to be settled by any
13612: decision regarding the claims of the two parties, but simply by cutting
13613: the knot—by declaring the series proposed by reason to be either too
13614: long or too short for the understanding, which could in neither case
13615: make its conceptions adequate with the ideas.
13616: 
13617: But we have overlooked, up to this point, an essential difference
13618: existing between the conceptions of the understanding which reason
13619: endeavours to raise to the rank of ideas—two of these indicating a
13620: mathematical, and two a dynamical synthesis of phenomena. Hitherto, it
13621: was necessary to signalize this distinction; for, just as in our
13622: general representation of all transcendental ideas, we considered them
13623: under phenomenal conditions, so, in the two mathematical ideas, our
13624: discussion is concerned solely with an object in the world of
13625: phenomena. But as we are now about to proceed to the consideration of
13626: the dynamical conceptions of the understanding, and their adequateness
13627: with ideas, we must not lose sight of this distinction. We shall find
13628: that it opens up to us an entirely new view of the conflict in which
13629: reason is involved. For, while in the first two antinomies, both
13630: parties were dismissed, on the ground of having advanced statements
13631: based upon false hypothesis; in the present case the hope appears of
13632: discovering a hypothesis which may be consistent with the demands of
13633: reason, and, the judge completing the statement of the grounds of
13634: claim, which both parties had left in an unsatisfactory state, the
13635: question may be settled on its own merits, not by dismissing the
13636: claimants, but by a comparison of the arguments on both sides. If we
13637: consider merely their extension, and whether they are adequate with
13638: ideas, the series of conditions may be regarded as all homogeneous. But
13639: the conception of the understanding which lies at the basis of these
13640: ideas, contains either a synthesis of the homogeneous (presupposed in
13641: every quantity—in its composition as well as in its division) or of the
13642: heterogeneous, which is the case in the dynamical synthesis of cause
13643: and effect, as well as of the necessary and the contingent.
13644: 
13645: Thus it happens that in the mathematical series of phenomena no other
13646: than a sensuous condition is admissible—a condition which is itself a
13647: member of the series; while the dynamical series of sensuous conditions
13648: admits a heterogeneous condition, which is not a member of the series,
13649: but, as purely intelligible, lies out of and beyond it. And thus reason
13650: is satisfied, and an unconditioned placed at the head of the series of
13651: phenomena, without introducing confusion into or discontinuing it,
13652: contrary to the principles of the understanding.
13653: 
13654: Now, from the fact that the dynamical ideas admit a condition of
13655: phenomena which does not form a part of the series of phenomena, arises
13656: a result which we should not have expected from an antinomy. In former
13657: cases, the result was that both contradictory dialectical statements
13658: were declared to be false. In the present case, we find the conditioned
13659: in the dynamical series connected with an empirically unconditioned,
13660: but non-sensuous condition; and thus satisfaction is done to the
13661: understanding on the one hand and to the reason on the other.[62]
13662: While, moreover, the dialectical arguments for unconditioned totality
13663: in mere phenomena fall to the ground, both propositions of reason may
13664: be shown to be true in their proper signification. This could not
13665: happen in the case of the cosmological ideas which demanded a
13666: mathematically unconditioned unity; for no condition could be placed at
13667: the head of the series of phenomena, except one which was itself a
13668: phenomenon and consequently a member of the series.
13669: 
13670:  [62] For the understanding cannot admit among phenomena a condition
13671:  which is itself empirically unconditioned. But if it is possible to
13672:  cogitate an intelligible condition—one which is not a member of the
13673:  series of phenomena—for a conditioned phenomenon, without breaking the
13674:  series of empirical conditions, such a condition may be admissible as
13675:  empirically unconditioned, and the empirical regress continue regular,
13676:  unceasing, and intact.
13677: 
13678: III. Solution of the Cosmological Idea of the Totality of the Deduction
13679: of Cosmical Events from their Causes
13680: 
13681: There are only two modes of causality cogitable—the causality of nature
13682: or of freedom. The first is the conjunction of a particular state with
13683: another preceding it in the world of sense, the former following the
13684: latter by virtue of a law. Now, as the causality of phenomena is
13685: subject to conditions of time, and the preceding state, if it had
13686: always existed, could not have produced an effect which would make its
13687: first appearance at a particular time, the causality of a cause must
13688: itself be an effect—must itself have begun to be, and therefore,
13689: according to the principle of the understanding, itself requires a
13690: cause.
13691: 
13692: We must understand, on the contrary, by the term freedom, in the
13693: cosmological sense, a faculty of the spontaneous origination of a
13694: state; the causality of which, therefore, is not subordinated to
13695: another cause determining it in time. Freedom is in this sense a pure
13696: transcendental idea, which, in the first place, contains no empirical
13697: element; the object of which, in the second place, cannot be given or
13698: determined in any experience, because it is a universal law of the very
13699: possibility of experience, that everything which happens must have a
13700: cause, that consequently the causality of a cause, being itself
13701: something that has happened, must also have a cause. In this view of
13702: the case, the whole field of experience, how far soever it may extend,
13703: contains nothing that is not subject to the laws of nature. But, as we
13704: cannot by this means attain to an absolute totality of conditions in
13705: reference to the series of causes and effects, reason creates the idea
13706: of a spontaneity, which can begin to act of itself, and without any
13707: external cause determining it to action, according to the natural law
13708: of causality.
13709: 
13710: It is especially remarkable that the practical conception of freedom is
13711: based upon the transcendental idea, and that the question of the
13712: possibility of the former is difficult only as it involves the
13713: consideration of the truth of the latter. Freedom, in the practical
13714: sense, is the independence of the will of coercion by sensuous
13715: impulses. A will is sensuous, in so far as it is pathologically
13716: affected (by sensuous impulses); it is termed animal (arbitrium
13717: brutum), when it is pathologically necessitated. The human will is
13718: certainly an arbitrium sensitivum, not brutum, but liberum; because
13719: sensuousness does not necessitate its action, a faculty existing in man
13720: of self-determination, independently of all sensuous coercion.
13721: 
13722: It is plain that, if all causality in the world of sense were
13723: natural—and natural only—every event would be determined by another
13724: according to necessary laws, and that, consequently, phenomena, in so
13725: far as they determine the will, must necessitate every action as a
13726: natural effect from themselves; and thus all practical freedom would
13727: fall to the ground with the transcendental idea. For the latter
13728: presupposes that although a certain thing has not happened, it ought to
13729: have happened, and that, consequently, its phenomenal cause was not so
13730: powerful and determinative as to exclude the causality of our will—a
13731: causality capable of producing effects independently of and even in
13732: opposition to the power of natural causes, and capable, consequently,
13733: of spontaneously originating a series of events.
13734: 
13735: Here, too, we find it to be the case, as we generally found in the
13736: self-contradictions and perplexities of a reason which strives to pass
13737: the bounds of possible experience, that the problem is properly not
13738: physiological, but transcendental. The question of the possibility of
13739: freedom does indeed concern psychology; but, as it rests upon
13740: dialectical arguments of pure reason, its solution must engage the
13741: attention of transcendental philosophy. Before attempting this
13742: solution, a task which transcendental philosophy cannot decline, it
13743: will be advisable to make a remark with regard to its procedure in the
13744: settlement of the question.
13745: 
13746: If phenomena were things in themselves, and time and space forms of the
13747: existence of things, condition and conditioned would always be members
13748: of the same series; and thus would arise in the present case the
13749: antinomy common to all transcendental ideas—that their series is either
13750: too great or too small for the understanding. The dynamical ideas,
13751: which we are about to discuss in this and the following section,
13752: possess the peculiarity of relating to an object, not considered as a
13753: quantity, but as an existence; and thus, in the discussion of the
13754: present question, we may make abstraction of the quantity of the series
13755: of conditions, and consider merely the dynamical relation of the
13756: condition to the conditioned. The question, then, suggests itself,
13757: whether freedom is possible; and, if it is, whether it can consist with
13758: the universality of the natural law of causality; and, consequently,
13759: whether we enounce a proper disjunctive proposition when we say: “Every
13760: effect must have its origin either in nature or in freedom,” or whether
13761: both cannot exist together in the same event in different relations.
13762: The principle of an unbroken connection between all events in the
13763: phenomenal world, in accordance with the unchangeable laws of nature,
13764: is a well-established principle of transcendental analytic which admits
13765: of no exception. The question, therefore, is: “Whether an effect,
13766: determined according to the laws of nature, can at the same time be
13767: produced by a free agent, or whether freedom and nature mutually
13768: exclude each other?” And here, the common but fallacious hypothesis of
13769: the absolute reality of phenomena manifests its injurious influence in
13770: embarrassing the procedure of reason. For if phenomena are things in
13771: themselves, freedom is impossible. In this case, nature is the complete
13772: and all-sufficient cause of every event; and condition and conditioned,
13773: cause and effect are contained in the same series, and necessitated by
13774: the same law. If, on the contrary, phenomena are held to be, as they
13775: are in fact, nothing more than mere representations, connected with
13776: each other in accordance with empirical laws, they must have a ground
13777: which is not phenomenal. But the causality of such an intelligible
13778: cause is not determined or determinable by phenomena; although its
13779: effects, as phenomena, must be determined by other phenomenal
13780: existences. This cause and its causality exist therefore out of and
13781: apart from the series of phenomena; while its effects do exist and are
13782: discoverable in the series of empirical conditions. Such an effect may
13783: therefore be considered to be free in relation to its intelligible
13784: cause, and necessary in relation to the phenomena from which it is a
13785: necessary consequence—a distinction which, stated in this perfectly
13786: general and abstract manner, must appear in the highest degree subtle
13787: and obscure. The sequel will explain. It is sufficient, at present, to
13788: remark that, as the complete and unbroken connection of phenomena is an
13789: unalterable law of nature, freedom is impossible—on the supposition
13790: that phenomena are absolutely real. Hence those philosophers who adhere
13791: to the common opinion on this subject can never succeed in reconciling
13792: the ideas of nature and freedom.
13793: 
13794: _Possibility of Freedom in Harmony with the Universal Law of Natural
13795: Necessity._
13796: 
13797: That element in a sensuous object which is not itself sensuous, I may
13798: be allowed to term intelligible. If, accordingly, an object which must
13799: be regarded as a sensuous phenomenon possesses a faculty which is not
13800: an object of sensuous intuition, but by means of which it is capable of
13801: being the cause of phenomena, the causality of an object or existence
13802: of this kind may be regarded from two different points of view. It may
13803: be considered to be intelligible, as regards its action—the action of a
13804: thing which is a thing in itself, and sensuous, as regards its
13805: effects—the effects of a phenomenon belonging to the sensuous world. We
13806: should accordingly, have to form both an empirical and an intellectual
13807: conception of the causality of such a faculty or power—both, however,
13808: having reference to the same effect. This twofold manner of cogitating
13809: a power residing in a sensuous object does not run counter to any of
13810: the conceptions which we ought to form of the world of phenomena or of
13811: a possible experience. Phenomena—not being things in themselves—must
13812: have a transcendental object as a foundation, which determines them as
13813: mere representations; and there seems to be no reason why we should not
13814: ascribe to this transcendental object, in addition to the property of
13815: self-phenomenization, a causality whose effects are to be met with in
13816: the world of phenomena, although it is not itself a phenomenon. But
13817: every effective cause must possess a character, that is to say, a law
13818: of its causality, without which it would cease to be a cause. In the
13819: above case, then, every sensuous object would possess an empirical
13820: character, which guaranteed that its actions, as phenomena, stand in
13821: complete and harmonious connection, conformably to unvarying natural
13822: laws, with all other phenomena, and can be deduced from these, as
13823: conditions, and that they do thus, in connection with these, constitute
13824: a series in the order of nature. This sensuous object must, in the
13825: second place, possess an intelligible character, which guarantees it to
13826: be the cause of those actions, as phenomena, although it is not itself
13827: a phenomenon nor subordinate to the conditions of the world of sense.
13828: The former may be termed the character of the thing as a phenomenon,
13829: the latter the character of the thing as a thing in itself.
13830: 
13831: Now this active subject would, in its character of intelligible
13832: subject, be subordinate to no conditions of time, for time is only a
13833: condition of phenomena, and not of things in themselves. No action
13834: would begin or cease to be in this subject; it would consequently be
13835: free from the law of all determination of time—the law of change,
13836: namely, that everything which happens must have a cause in the
13837: phenomena of a preceding state. In one word, the causality of the
13838: subject, in so far as it is intelligible, would not form part of the
13839: series of empirical conditions which determine and necessitate an event
13840: in the world of sense. Again, this intelligible character of a thing
13841: cannot be immediately cognized, because we can perceive nothing but
13842: phenomena, but it must be capable of being cogitated in harmony with
13843: the empirical character; for we always find ourselves compelled to
13844: place, in thought, a transcendental object at the basis of phenomena
13845: although we can never know what this object is in itself.
13846: 
13847: In virtue of its empirical character, this subject would at the same
13848: time be subordinate to all the empirical laws of causality, and, as a
13849: phenomenon and member of the sensuous world, its effects would have to
13850: be accounted for by a reference to preceding phenomena. Eternal
13851: phenomena must be capable of influencing it; and its actions, in
13852: accordance with natural laws, must explain to us how its empirical
13853: character, that is, the law of its causality, is to be cognized in and
13854: by means of experience. In a word, all requisites for a complete and
13855: necessary determination of these actions must be presented to us by
13856: experience.
13857: 
13858: In virtue of its intelligible character, on the other hand (although we
13859: possess only a general conception of this character), the subject must
13860: be regarded as free from all sensuous influences, and from all
13861: phenomenal determination. Moreover, as nothing happens in this
13862: subject—for it is a noumenon, and there does not consequently exist in
13863: it any change, demanding the dynamical determination of time, and for
13864: the same reason no connection with phenomena as causes—this active
13865: existence must in its actions be free from and independent of natural
13866: necessity, for this necessity exists only in the world of phenomena. It
13867: would be quite correct to say that it originates or begins its effects
13868: in the world of sense from itself, although the action productive of
13869: these effects does not begin in itself. We should not be in this case
13870: affirming that these sensuous effects began to exist of themselves,
13871: because they are always determined by prior empirical conditions—by
13872: virtue of the empirical character, which is the phenomenon of the
13873: intelligible character—and are possible only as constituting a
13874: continuation of the series of natural causes. And thus nature and
13875: freedom, each in the complete and absolute signification of these
13876: terms, can exist, without contradiction or disagreement, in the same
13877: action.
13878: 
13879: _Exposition of the Cosmological Idea of Freedom in Harmony with the
13880: Universal Law of Natural Necessity._
13881: 
13882: I have thought it advisable to lay before the reader at first merely a
13883: sketch of the solution of this transcendental problem, in order to
13884: enable him to form with greater ease a clear conception of the course
13885: which reason must adopt in the solution. I shall now proceed to exhibit
13886: the several momenta of this solution, and to consider them in their
13887: order.
13888: 
13889: The natural law that everything which happens must have a cause, that
13890: the causality of this cause, that is, the action of the cause (which
13891: cannot always have existed, but must be itself an event, for it
13892: precedes in time some effect which it has originated), must have itself
13893: a phenomenal cause, by which it is determined and, and, consequently,
13894: all events are empirically determined in an order of nature—this law, I
13895: say, which lies at the foundation of the possibility of experience, and
13896: of a connected system of phenomena or nature is a law of the
13897: understanding, from which no departure, and to which no exception, can
13898: be admitted. For to except even a single phenomenon from its operation
13899: is to exclude it from the sphere of possible experience and thus to
13900: admit it to be a mere fiction of thought or phantom of the brain.
13901: 
13902: Thus we are obliged to acknowledge the existence of a chain of causes,
13903: in which, however, absolute totality cannot be found. But we need not
13904: detain ourselves with this question, for it has already been
13905: sufficiently answered in our discussion of the antinomies into which
13906: reason falls, when it attempts to reach the unconditioned in the series
13907: of phenomena. If we permit ourselves to be deceived by the illusion of
13908: transcendental idealism, we shall find that neither nature nor freedom
13909: exists. Now the question is: “Whether, admitting the existence of
13910: natural necessity in the world of phenomena, it is possible to consider
13911: an effect as at the same time an effect of nature and an effect of
13912: freedom—or, whether these two modes of causality are contradictory and
13913: incompatible?”
13914: 
13915: No phenomenal cause can absolutely and of itself begin a series. Every
13916: action, in so far as it is productive of an event, is itself an event
13917: or occurrence, and presupposes another preceding state, in which its
13918: cause existed. Thus everything that happens is but a continuation of a
13919: series, and an absolute beginning is impossible in the sensuous world.
13920: The actions of natural causes are, accordingly, themselves effects, and
13921: presuppose causes preceding them in time. A primal action which forms
13922: an absolute beginning, is beyond the causal power of phenomena.
13923: 
13924: Now, is it absolutely necessary that, granting that all effects are
13925: phenomena, the causality of the cause of these effects must also be a
13926: phenomenon and belong to the empirical world? Is it not rather possible
13927: that, although every effect in the phenomenal world must be connected
13928: with an empirical cause, according to the universal law of nature, this
13929: empirical causality may be itself the effect of a non-empirical and
13930: intelligible causality—its connection with natural causes remaining
13931: nevertheless intact? Such a causality would be considered, in reference
13932: to phenomena, as the primal action of a cause, which is in so far,
13933: therefore, not phenomenal, but, by reason of this faculty or power,
13934: intelligible; although it must, at the same time, as a link in the
13935: chain of nature, be regarded as belonging to the sensuous world.
13936: 
13937: A belief in the reciprocal causality of phenomena is necessary, if we
13938: are required to look for and to present the natural conditions of
13939: natural events, that is to say, their causes. This being admitted as
13940: unexceptionably valid, the requirements of the understanding, which
13941: recognizes nothing but nature in the region of phenomena, are
13942: satisfied, and our physical explanations of physical phenomena may
13943: proceed in their regular course, without hindrance and without
13944: opposition. But it is no stumbling-block in the way, even assuming the
13945: idea to be a pure fiction, to admit that there are some natural causes
13946: in the possession of a faculty which is not empirical, but
13947: intelligible, inasmuch as it is not determined to action by empirical
13948: conditions, but purely and solely upon grounds brought forward by the
13949: understanding—this action being still, when the cause is phenomenized,
13950: in perfect accordance with the laws of empirical causality. Thus the
13951: acting subject, as a causal phenomenon, would continue to preserve a
13952: complete connection with nature and natural conditions; and the
13953: phenomenon only of the subject (with all its phenomenal causality)
13954: would contain certain conditions, which, if we ascend from the
13955: empirical to the transcendental object, must necessarily be regarded as
13956: intelligible. For, if we attend, in our inquiries with regard to causes
13957: in the world of phenomena, to the directions of nature alone, we need
13958: not trouble ourselves about the relation in which the transcendental
13959: subject, which is completely unknown to us, stands to these phenomena
13960: and their connection in nature. The intelligible ground of phenomena in
13961: this subject does not concern empirical questions. It has to do only
13962: with pure thought; and, although the effects of this thought and action
13963: of the pure understanding are discoverable in phenomena, these
13964: phenomena must nevertheless be capable of a full and complete
13965: explanation, upon purely physical grounds and in accordance with
13966: natural laws. And in this case we attend solely to their empirical and
13967: omit all consideration of their intelligible character (which is the
13968: transcendental cause of the former) as completely unknown, except in so
13969: far as it is exhibited by the latter as its empirical symbol. Now let
13970: us apply this to experience. Man is a phenomenon of the sensuous world
13971: and, at the same time, therefore, a natural cause, the causality of
13972: which must be regulated by empirical laws. As such, he must possess an
13973: empirical character, like all other natural phenomena. We remark this
13974: empirical character in his actions, which reveal the presence of
13975: certain powers and faculties. If we consider inanimate or merely animal
13976: nature, we can discover no reason for ascribing to ourselves any other
13977: than a faculty which is determined in a purely sensuous manner. But
13978: man, to whom nature reveals herself only through sense, cognizes
13979: himself not only by his senses, but also through pure apperception; and
13980: this in actions and internal determinations, which he cannot regard as
13981: sensuous impressions. He is thus to himself, on the one hand, a
13982: phenomenon, but on the other hand, in respect of certain faculties, a
13983: purely intelligible object—intelligible, because its action cannot be
13984: ascribed to sensuous receptivity. These faculties are understanding and
13985: reason. The latter, especially, is in a peculiar manner distinct from
13986: all empirically-conditioned faculties, for it employs ideas alone in
13987: the consideration of its objects, and by means of these determines the
13988: understanding, which then proceeds to make an empirical use of its own
13989: conceptions, which, like the ideas of reason, are pure and
13990: non-empirical.
13991: 
13992: That reason possesses the faculty of causality, or that at least we are
13993: compelled so to represent it, is evident from the imperatives, which in
13994: the sphere of the practical we impose on many of our executive powers.
13995: The words I ought express a species of necessity, and imply a
13996: connection with grounds which nature does not and cannot present to the
13997: mind of man. Understanding knows nothing in nature but that which is,
13998: or has been, or will be. It would be absurd to say that anything in
13999: nature ought to be other than it is in the relations of time in which
14000: it stands; indeed, the ought, when we consider merely the course of
14001: nature, has neither application nor meaning. The question, “What ought
14002: to happen in the sphere of nature?” is just as absurd as the question,
14003: “What ought to be the properties of a circle?” All that we are entitled
14004: to ask is, “What takes place in nature?” or, in the latter case, “What
14005: are the properties of a circle?”
14006: 
14007: But the idea of an ought or of duty indicates a possible action, the
14008: ground of which is a pure conception; while the ground of a merely
14009: natural action is, on the contrary, always a phenomenon. This action
14010: must certainly be possible under physical conditions, if it is
14011: prescribed by the moral imperative ought; but these physical or natural
14012: conditions do not concern the determination of the will itself, they
14013: relate to its effects alone, and the consequences of the effect in the
14014: world of phenomena. Whatever number of motives nature may present to my
14015: will, whatever sensuous impulses—the moral ought it is beyond their
14016: power to produce. They may produce a volition, which, so far from being
14017: necessary, is always conditioned—a volition to which the ought
14018: enunciated by reason, sets an aim and a standard, gives permission or
14019: prohibition. Be the object what it may, purely sensuous—as pleasure, or
14020: presented by pure reason—as good, reason will not yield to grounds
14021: which have an empirical origin. Reason will not follow the order of
14022: things presented by experience, but, with perfect spontaneity,
14023: rearranges them according to ideas, with which it compels empirical
14024: conditions to agree. It declares, in the name of these ideas, certain
14025: actions to be necessary which nevertheless have not taken place and
14026: which perhaps never will take place; and yet presupposes that it
14027: possesses the faculty of causality in relation to these actions. For,
14028: in the absence of this supposition, it could not expect its ideas to
14029: produce certain effects in the world of experience.
14030: 
14031: Now, let us stop here and admit it to be at least possible that reason
14032: does stand in a really causal relation to phenomena. In this case it
14033: must—pure reason as it is—exhibit an empirical character. For every
14034: cause supposes a rule, according to which certain phenomena follow as
14035: effects from the cause, and every rule requires uniformity in these
14036: effects; and this is the proper ground of the conception of a cause—as
14037: a faculty or power. Now this conception (of a cause) may be termed the
14038: empirical character of reason; and this character is a permanent one,
14039: while the effects produced appear, in conformity with the various
14040: conditions which accompany and partly limit them, in various forms.
14041: 
14042: Thus the volition of every man has an empirical character, which is
14043: nothing more than the causality of his reason, in so far as its effects
14044: in the phenomenal world manifest the presence of a rule, according to
14045: which we are enabled to examine, in their several kinds and degrees,
14046: the actions of this causality and the rational grounds for these
14047: actions, and in this way to decide upon the subjective principles of
14048: the volition. Now we learn what this empirical character is only from
14049: phenomenal effects, and from the rule of these which is presented by
14050: experience; and for this reason all the actions of man in the world of
14051: phenomena are determined by his empirical character, and the
14052: co-operative causes of nature. If, then, we could investigate all the
14053: phenomena of human volition to their lowest foundation in the mind,
14054: there would be no action which we could not anticipate with certainty,
14055: and recognize to be absolutely necessary from its preceding conditions.
14056: So far as relates to this empirical character, therefore, there can be
14057: no freedom; and it is only in the light of this character that we can
14058: consider the human will, when we confine ourselves to simple
14059: observation and, as is the case in anthropology, institute a
14060: physiological investigation of the motive causes of human actions.
14061: 
14062: But when we consider the same actions in relation to reason—not for the
14063: purpose of explaining their origin, that is, in relation to speculative
14064: reason, but to practical reason, as the producing cause of these
14065: actions—we shall discover a rule and an order very different from those
14066: of nature and experience. For the declaration of this mental faculty
14067: may be that what has and could not but take place in the course of
14068: nature, ought not to have taken place. Sometimes, too, we discover, or
14069: believe that we discover, that the ideas of reason did actually stand
14070: in a causal relation to certain actions of man; and that these actions
14071: have taken place because they were determined, not by empirical causes,
14072: but by the act of the will upon grounds of reason.
14073: 
14074: Now, granting that reason stands in a causal relation to phenomena; can
14075: an action of reason be called free, when we know that, sensuously, in
14076: its empirical character, it is completely determined and absolutely
14077: necessary? But this empirical character is itself determined by the
14078: intelligible character. The latter we cannot cognize; we can only
14079: indicate it by means of phenomena, which enable us to have an immediate
14080: cognition only of the empirical character.[63] An action, then, in so
14081: far as it is to be ascribed to an intelligible cause, does not result
14082: from it in accordance with empirical laws. That is to say, not the
14083: conditions of pure reason, but only their effects in the internal
14084: sense, precede the act. Pure reason, as a purely intelligible faculty,
14085: is not subject to the conditions of time. The causality of reason in
14086: its intelligible character does not begin to be; it does not make its
14087: appearance at a certain time, for the purpose of producing an effect.
14088: If this were not the case, the causality of reason would be subservient
14089: to the natural law of phenomena, which determines them according to
14090: time, and as a series of causes and effects in time; it would
14091: consequently cease to be freedom and become a part of nature. We are
14092: therefore justified in saying: “If reason stands in a causal relation
14093: to phenomena, it is a faculty which originates the sensuous condition
14094: of an empirical series of effects.” For the condition, which resides in
14095: the reason, is non-sensuous, and therefore cannot be originated, or
14096: begin to be. And thus we find—what we could not discover in any
14097: empirical series—a condition of a successive series of events itself
14098: empirically unconditioned. For, in the present case, the condition
14099: stands out of and beyond the series of phenomena—it is intelligible,
14100: and it consequently cannot be subjected to any sensuous condition, or
14101: to any time-determination by a preceding cause.
14102: 
14103:  [63] The real morality of actions—their merit or demerit, and even
14104:  that of our own conduct, is completely unknown to us. Our estimates
14105:  can relate only to their empirical character. How much is the result
14106:  of the action of free will, how much is to be ascribed to nature and
14107:  to blameless error, or to a happy constitution of temperament (merito
14108:  fortunae), no one can discover, nor, for this reason, determine with
14109:  perfect justice.
14110: 
14111: 
14112: But, in another respect, the same cause belongs also to the series of
14113: phenomena. Man is himself a phenomenon. His will has an empirical
14114: character, which is the empirical cause of all his actions. There is no
14115: condition—determining man and his volition in conformity with this
14116: character—which does not itself form part of the series of effects in
14117: nature, and is subject to their law—the law according to which an
14118: empirically undetermined cause of an event in time cannot exist. For
14119: this reason no given action can have an absolute and spontaneous
14120: origination, all actions being phenomena, and belonging to the world of
14121: experience. But it cannot be said of reason, that the state in which it
14122: determines the will is always preceded by some other state determining
14123: it. For reason is not a phenomenon, and therefore not subject to
14124: sensuous conditions; and, consequently, even in relation to its
14125: causality, the sequence or conditions of time do not influence reason,
14126: nor can the dynamical law of nature, which determines the sequence of
14127: time according to certain rules, be applied to it.
14128: 
14129: Reason is consequently the permanent condition of all actions of the
14130: human will. Each of these is determined in the empirical character of
14131: the man, even before it has taken place. The intelligible character, of
14132: which the former is but the sensuous schema, knows no before or after;
14133: and every action, irrespective of the time-relation in which it stands
14134: with other phenomena, is the immediate effect of the intelligible
14135: character of pure reason, which, consequently, enjoys freedom of
14136: action, and is not dynamically determined either by internal or
14137: external preceding conditions. This freedom must not be described, in a
14138: merely negative manner, as independence of empirical conditions, for in
14139: this case the faculty of reason would cease to be a cause of phenomena;
14140: but it must be regarded, positively, as a faculty which can
14141: spontaneously originate a series of events. At the same time, it must
14142: not be supposed that any beginning can take place in reason; on the
14143: contrary, reason, as the unconditioned condition of all action of the
14144: will, admits of no time-conditions, although its effect does really
14145: begin in a series of phenomena—a beginning which is not, however,
14146: absolutely primal.
14147: 
14148: I shall illustrate this regulative principle of reason by an example,
14149: from its employment in the world of experience; proved it cannot be by
14150: any amount of experience, or by any number of facts, for such arguments
14151: cannot establish the truth of transcendental propositions. Let us take
14152: a voluntary action—for example, a falsehood—by means of which a man has
14153: introduced a certain degree of confusion into the social life of
14154: humanity, which is judged according to the motives from which it
14155: originated, and the blame of which and of the evil consequences arising
14156: from it, is imputed to the offender. We at first proceed to examine the
14157: empirical character of the offence, and for this purpose we endeavour
14158: to penetrate to the sources of that character, such as a defective
14159: education, bad company, a shameless and wicked disposition, frivolity,
14160: and want of reflection—not forgetting also the occasioning causes which
14161: prevailed at the moment of the transgression. In this the procedure is
14162: exactly the same as that pursued in the investigation of the series of
14163: causes which determine a given physical effect. Now, although we
14164: believe the action to have been determined by all these circumstances,
14165: we do not the less blame the offender. We do not blame him for his
14166: unhappy disposition, nor for the circumstances which influenced him,
14167: nay, not even for his former course of life; for we presuppose that all
14168: these considerations may be set aside, that the series of preceding
14169: conditions may be regarded as having never existed, and that the action
14170: may be considered as completely unconditioned in relation to any state
14171: preceding, just as if the agent commenced with it an entirely new
14172: series of effects. Our blame of the offender is grounded upon a law of
14173: reason, which requires us to regard this faculty as a cause, which
14174: could have and ought to have otherwise determined the behaviour of the
14175: culprit, independently of all empirical conditions. This causality of
14176: reason we do not regard as a co-operating agency, but as complete in
14177: itself. It matters not whether the sensuous impulses favoured or
14178: opposed the action of this causality, the offence is estimated
14179: according to its intelligible character—the offender is decidedly
14180: worthy of blame, the moment he utters a falsehood. It follows that we
14181: regard reason, in spite of the empirical conditions of the act, as
14182: completely free, and therefore, as in the present case,
14183: culpable.
14184: 
14185: The above judgement is complete evidence that we are accustomed to
14186: think that reason is not affected by sensuous conditions, that in it no
14187: change takes place—although its phenomena, in other words, the mode in
14188: which it appears in its effects, are subject to change—that in it no
14189: preceding state determines the following, and, consequently, that it
14190: does not form a member of the series of sensuous conditions which
14191: necessitate phenomena according to natural laws. Reason is present and
14192: the same in all human actions and at all times; but it does not itself
14193: exist in time, and therefore does not enter upon any state in which it
14194: did not formerly exist. It is, relatively to new states or conditions,
14195: determining, but not determinable. Hence we cannot ask: “Why did not
14196: reason determine itself in a different manner?” The question ought to
14197: be thus stated: “Why did not reason employ its power of causality to
14198: determine certain phenomena in a different manner?” But this is a
14199: question which admits of no answer. For a different intelligible
14200: character would have exhibited a different empirical character; and,
14201: when we say that, in spite of the course which his whole former life
14202: has taken, the offender could have refrained from uttering the
14203: falsehood, this means merely that the act was subject to the power and
14204: authority—permissive or prohibitive—of reason. Now, reason is not
14205: subject in its causality to any conditions of phenomena or of time; and
14206: a difference in time may produce a difference in the relation of
14207: phenomena to each other—for these are not things and therefore not
14208: causes in themselves—but it cannot produce any difference in the
14209: relation in which the action stands to the faculty of reason.
14210: 
14211: Thus, then, in our investigation into free actions and the causal power
14212: which produced them, we arrive at an intelligible cause, beyond which,
14213: however, we cannot go; although we can recognize that it is free, that
14214: is, independent of all sensuous conditions, and that, in this way, it
14215: may be the sensuously unconditioned condition of phenomena. But for
14216: what reason the intelligible character generates such and such
14217: phenomena and exhibits such and such an empirical character under
14218: certain circumstances, it is beyond the power of our reason to decide.
14219: The question is as much above the power and the sphere of reason as the
14220: following would be: “Why does the transcendental object of our external
14221: sensuous intuition allow of no other form than that of intuition in
14222: space?” But the problem, which we were called upon to solve, does not
14223: require us to entertain any such questions. The problem was merely
14224: this—whether freedom and natural necessity can exist without opposition
14225: in the same action. To this question we have given a sufficient answer;
14226: for we have shown that, as the former stands in a relation to a
14227: different kind of condition from those of the latter, the law of the
14228: one does not affect the law of the other and that, consequently, both
14229: can exist together in independence of and without interference with
14230: each other.
14231: 
14232: The reader must be careful to remark that my intention in the above
14233: remarks has not been to prove the actual existence of freedom, as a
14234: faculty in which resides the cause of certain sensuous phenomena. For,
14235: not to mention that such an argument would not have a transcendental
14236: character, nor have been limited to the discussion of pure
14237: conceptions—all attempts at inferring from experience what cannot be
14238: cogitated in accordance with its laws, must ever be unsuccessful. Nay,
14239: more, I have not even aimed at demonstrating the possibility of
14240: freedom; for this too would have been a vain endeavour, inasmuch as it
14241: is beyond the power of the mind to cognize the possibility of a reality
14242: or of a causal power by the aid of mere à priori conceptions. Freedom
14243: has been considered in the foregoing remarks only as a transcendental
14244: idea, by means of which reason aims at originating a series of
14245: conditions in the world of phenomena with the help of that which is
14246: sensuously unconditioned, involving itself, however, in an antinomy
14247: with the laws which itself prescribes for the conduct of the
14248: understanding. That this antinomy is based upon a mere illusion, and
14249: that nature and freedom are at least not opposed—this was the only
14250: thing in our power to prove, and the question which it was our task to
14251: solve.
14252: 
14253: IV. Solution of the Cosmological Idea of the Totality of the Dependence
14254: of Phenomenal Existences
14255: 
14256: In the preceding remarks, we considered the changes in the world of
14257: sense as constituting a dynamical series, in which each member is
14258: subordinated to another—as its cause. Our present purpose is to avail
14259: ourselves of this series of states or conditions as a guide to an
14260: existence which may be the highest condition of all changeable
14261: phenomena, that is, to a necessary being. Our endeavour to reach, not
14262: the unconditioned causality, but the unconditioned existence, of
14263: substance. The series before us is therefore a series of conceptions,
14264: and not of intuitions (in which the one intuition is the condition of
14265: the other).
14266: 
14267: But it is evident that, as all phenomena are subject to change and
14268: conditioned in their existence, the series of dependent existences
14269: cannot embrace an unconditioned member, the existence of which would be
14270: absolutely necessary. It follows that, if phenomena were things in
14271: themselves, and—as an immediate consequence from this
14272: supposition—condition and conditioned belonged to the same series of
14273: phenomena, the existence of a necessary being, as the condition of the
14274: existence of sensuous phenomena, would be perfectly impossible.
14275: 
14276: An important distinction, however, exists between the dynamical and the
14277: mathematical regress. The latter is engaged solely with the combination
14278: of parts into a whole, or with the division of a whole into its parts;
14279: and therefore are the conditions of its series parts of the series, and
14280: to be consequently regarded as homogeneous, and for this reason, as
14281: consisting, without exception, of phenomena. If the former regress, on
14282: the contrary, the aim of which is not to establish the possibility of
14283: an unconditioned whole consisting of given parts, or of an
14284: unconditioned part of a given whole, but to demonstrate the possibility
14285: of the deduction of a certain state from its cause, or of the
14286: contingent existence of substance from that which exists necessarily,
14287: it is not requisite that the condition should form part of an empirical
14288: series along with the conditioned.
14289: 
14290: In the case of the apparent antinomy with which we are at present
14291: dealing, there exists a way of escape from the difficulty; for it is
14292: not impossible that both of the contradictory statements may be true in
14293: different relations. All sensuous phenomena may be contingent, and
14294: consequently possess only an empirically conditioned existence, and yet
14295: there may also exist a non-empirical condition of the whole series, or,
14296: in other words, a necessary being. For this necessary being, as an
14297: intelligible condition, would not form a member—not even the highest
14298: member—of the series; the whole world of sense would be left in its
14299: empirically determined existence uninterfered with and uninfluenced.
14300: This would also form a ground of distinction between the modes of
14301: solution employed for the third and fourth antinomies. For, while in
14302: the consideration of freedom in the former antinomy, the thing
14303: itself—the cause (substantia phaenomenon)—was regarded as belonging to
14304: the series of conditions, and only its causality to the intelligible
14305: world—we are obliged in the present case to cogitate this necessary
14306: being as purely intelligible and as existing entirely apart from the
14307: world of sense (as an ens extramundanum); for otherwise it would be
14308: subject to the phenomenal law of contingency and dependence.
14309: 
14310: In relation to the present problem, therefore, the regulative principle
14311: of reason is that everything in the sensuous world possesses an
14312: empirically conditioned existence—that no property of the sensuous
14313: world possesses unconditioned necessity—that we are bound to expect,
14314: and, so far as is possible, to seek for the empirical condition of
14315: every member in the series of conditions—and that there is no
14316: sufficient reason to justify us in deducing any existence from a
14317: condition which lies out of and beyond the empirical series, or in
14318: regarding any existence as independent and self-subsistent; although
14319: this should not prevent us from recognizing the possibility of the
14320: whole series being based upon a being which is intelligible, and for
14321: this reason free from all empirical conditions.
14322: 
14323: But it has been far from my intention, in these remarks, to prove the
14324: existence of this unconditioned and necessary being, or even to
14325: evidence the possibility of a purely intelligible condition of the
14326: existence of all sensuous phenomena. As bounds were set to reason, to
14327: prevent it from leaving the guiding thread of empirical conditions and
14328: losing itself in transcendent theories which are incapable of concrete
14329: presentation; so it was my purpose, on the other hand, to set bounds to
14330: the law of the purely empirical understanding, and to protest against
14331: any attempts on its part at deciding on the possibility of things, or
14332: declaring the existence of the intelligible to be impossible, merely on
14333: the ground that it is not available for the explanation and exposition
14334: of phenomena. It has been shown, at the same time, that the contingency
14335: of all the phenomena of nature and their empirical conditions is quite
14336: consistent with the arbitrary hypothesis of a necessary, although
14337: purely intelligible condition, that no real contradiction exists
14338: between them and that, consequently, both may be true. The existence of
14339: such an absolutely necessary being may be impossible; but this can
14340: never be demonstrated from the universal contingency and dependence of
14341: sensuous phenomena, nor from the principle which forbids us to
14342: discontinue the series at some member of it, or to seek for its cause
14343: in some sphere of existence beyond the world of nature. Reason goes its
14344: way in the empirical world, and follows, too, its peculiar path in the
14345: sphere of the transcendental.
14346: 
14347: The sensuous world contains nothing but phenomena, which are mere
14348: representations, and always sensuously conditioned; things in
14349: themselves are not, and cannot be, objects to us. It is not to be
14350: wondered at, therefore, that we are not justified in leaping from some
14351: member of an empirical series beyond the world of sense, as if
14352: empirical representations were things in themselves, existing apart
14353: from their transcendental ground in the human mind, and the cause of
14354: whose existence may be sought out of the empirical series. This would
14355: certainly be the case with contingent things; but it cannot be with
14356: mere representations of things, the contingency of which is itself
14357: merely a phenomenon and can relate to no other regress than that which
14358: determines phenomena, that is, the empirical. But to cogitate an
14359: intelligible ground of phenomena, as free, moreover, from the
14360: contingency of the latter, conflicts neither with the unlimited nature
14361: of the empirical regress, nor with the complete contingency of
14362: phenomena. And the demonstration of this was the only thing necessary
14363: for the solution of this apparent antinomy. For if the condition of
14364: every conditioned—as regards its existence—is sensuous, and for this
14365: reason a part of the same series, it must be itself conditioned, as was
14366: shown in the antithesis of the fourth antinomy. The embarrassments into
14367: which a reason, which postulates the unconditioned, necessarily falls,
14368: must, therefore, continue to exist; or the unconditioned must be placed
14369: in the sphere of the intelligible. In this way, its necessity does not
14370: require, nor does it even permit, the presence of an empirical
14371: condition: and it is, consequently, unconditionally necessary.
14372: 
14373: The empirical employment of reason is not affected by the assumption of
14374: a purely intelligible being; it continues its operations on the
14375: principle of the contingency of all phenomena, proceeding from
14376: empirical conditions to still higher and higher conditions, themselves
14377: empirical. Just as little does this regulative principle exclude the
14378: assumption of an intelligible cause, when the question regards merely
14379: the pure employment of reason—in relation to ends or aims. For, in this
14380: case, an intelligible cause signifies merely the transcendental and to
14381: us unknown ground of the possibility of sensuous phenomena, and its
14382: existence, necessary and independent of all sensuous conditions, is not
14383: inconsistent with the contingency of phenomena, or with the unlimited
14384: possibility of regress which exists in the series of empirical
14385: conditions.
14386: 
14387: Concluding Remarks on the Antinomy of Pure Reason.
14388: 
14389: So long as the object of our rational conceptions is the totality of
14390: conditions in the world of phenomena, and the satisfaction, from this
14391: source, of the requirements of reason, so long are our ideas
14392: transcendental and cosmological. But when we set the
14393: unconditioned—which is the aim of all our inquiries—in a sphere which
14394: lies out of the world of sense and possible experience, our ideas
14395: become transcendent. They are then not merely serviceable towards the
14396: completion of the exercise of reason (which remains an idea, never
14397: executed, but always to be pursued); they detach themselves completely
14398: from experience and construct for themselves objects, the material of
14399: which has not been presented by experience, and the objective reality
14400: of which is not based upon the completion of the empirical series, but
14401: upon pure à priori conceptions. The intelligible object of these
14402: transcendent ideas may be conceded, as a transcendental object. But we
14403: cannot cogitate it as a thing determinable by certain distinct
14404: predicates relating to its internal nature, for it has no connection
14405: with empirical conceptions; nor are we justified in affirming the
14406: existence of any such object. It is, consequently, a mere product of
14407: the mind alone. Of all the cosmological ideas, however, it is that
14408: occasioning the fourth antinomy which compels us to venture upon this
14409: step. For the existence of phenomena, always conditioned and never
14410: self-subsistent, requires us to look for an object different from
14411: phenomena—an intelligible object, with which all contingency must
14412: cease. But, as we have allowed ourselves to assume the existence of a
14413: self-subsistent reality out of the field of experience, and are
14414: therefore obliged to regard phenomena as merely a contingent mode of
14415: representing intelligible objects employed by beings which are
14416: themselves intelligences—no other course remains for us than to follow
14417: analogy and employ the same mode in forming some conception of
14418: intelligible things, of which we have not the least knowledge, which
14419: nature taught us to use in the formation of empirical conceptions.
14420: Experience made us acquainted with the contingent. But we are at
14421: present engaged in the discussion of things which are not objects of
14422: experience; and must, therefore, deduce our knowledge of them from that
14423: which is necessary absolutely and in itself, that is, from pure
14424: conceptions. Hence the first step which we take out of the world of
14425: sense obliges us to begin our system of new cognition with the
14426: investigation of a necessary being, and to deduce from our conceptions
14427: of it all our conceptions of intelligible things. This we propose to
14428: attempt in the following chapter.
14429: 
14430: Chapter III. The Ideal of Pure Reason
14431: 
14432: Section I. Of the Ideal in General
14433: 
14434: We have seen that pure conceptions do not present objects to the mind,
14435: except under sensuous conditions; because the conditions of objective
14436: reality do not exist in these conceptions, which contain, in fact,
14437: nothing but the mere form of thought. They may, however, when applied
14438: to phenomena, be presented in concreto; for it is phenomena that
14439: present to them the materials for the formation of empirical
14440: conceptions, which are nothing more than concrete forms of the
14441: conceptions of the understanding. But ideas are still further removed
14442: from objective reality than categories; for no phenomenon can ever
14443: present them to the human mind in concreto. They contain a certain
14444: perfection, attainable by no possible empirical cognition; and they
14445: give to reason a systematic unity, to which the unity of experience
14446: attempts to approximate, but can never completely attain.
14447: 
14448: But still further removed than the idea from objective reality is the
14449: Ideal, by which term I understand the idea, not in concreto, but in
14450: individuo—as an individual thing, determinable or determined by the
14451: idea alone. The idea of humanity in its complete perfection supposes
14452: not only the advancement of all the powers and faculties, which
14453: constitute our conception of human nature, to a complete attainment of
14454: their final aims, but also everything which is requisite for the
14455: complete determination of the idea; for of all contradictory
14456: predicates, only one can conform with the idea of the perfect man. What
14457: I have termed an ideal was in Plato’s philosophy an idea of the divine
14458: mind—an individual object present to its pure intuition, the most
14459: perfect of every kind of possible beings, and the archetype of all
14460: phenomenal existences.
14461: 
14462: Without rising to these speculative heights, we are bound to confess
14463: that human reason contains not only ideas, but ideals, which possess,
14464: not, like those of Plato, creative, but certainly practical power—as
14465: regulative principles, and form the basis of the perfectibility of
14466: certain actions. Moral conceptions are not perfectly pure conceptions
14467: of reason, because an empirical element—of pleasure or pain—lies at the
14468: foundation of them. In relation, however, to the principle, whereby
14469: reason sets bounds to a freedom which is in itself without law, and
14470: consequently when we attend merely to their form, they may be
14471: considered as pure conceptions of reason. Virtue and wisdom in their
14472: perfect purity are ideas. But the wise man of the Stoics is an ideal,
14473: that is to say, a human being existing only in thought and in complete
14474: conformity with the idea of wisdom. As the idea provides a rule, so the
14475: ideal serves as an archetype for the perfect and complete determination
14476: of the copy. Thus the conduct of this wise and divine man serves us as
14477: a standard of action, with which we may compare and judge ourselves,
14478: which may help us to reform ourselves, although the perfection it
14479: demands can never be attained by us. Although we cannot concede
14480: objective reality to these ideals, they are not to be considered as
14481: chimeras; on the contrary, they provide reason with a standard, which
14482: enables it to estimate, by comparison, the degree of incompleteness in
14483: the objects presented to it. But to aim at realizing the ideal in an
14484: example in the world of experience—to describe, for instance, the
14485: character of the perfectly wise man in a romance—is impracticable. Nay
14486: more, there is something absurd in the attempt; and the result must be
14487: little edifying, as the natural limitations, which are continually
14488: breaking in upon the perfection and completeness of the idea, destroy
14489: the illusion in the story and throw an air of suspicion even on what is
14490: good in the idea, which hence appears fictitious and unreal.
14491: 
14492: Such is the constitution of the ideal of reason, which is always based
14493: upon determinate conceptions, and serves as a rule and a model for
14494: limitation or of criticism. Very different is the nature of the ideals
14495: of the imagination. Of these it is impossible to present an
14496: intelligible conception; they are a kind of monogram, drawn according
14497: to no determinate rule, and forming rather a vague picture—the
14498: production of many diverse experiences—than a determinate image. Such
14499: are the ideals which painters and physiognomists profess to have in
14500: their minds, and which can serve neither as a model for production nor
14501: as a standard for appreciation. They may be termed, though improperly,
14502: sensuous ideals, as they are declared to be models of certain possible
14503: empirical intuitions. They cannot, however, furnish rules or standards
14504: for explanation or examination.
14505: 
14506: In its ideals, reason aims at complete and perfect determination
14507: according to à priori rules; and hence it cogitates an object, which
14508: must be completely determinable in conformity with principles, although
14509: all empirical conditions are absent, and the conception of the object
14510: is on this account transcendent.
14511: 
14512: Section II. Of the Transcendental Ideal (Prototypon Trancendentale)
14513: 
14514: Every conception is, in relation to that which is not contained in it,
14515: undetermined and subject to the principle of determinability. This
14516: principle is that, of every two contradictorily opposed predicates,
14517: only one can belong to a conception. It is a purely logical principle,
14518: itself based upon the principle of contradiction; inasmuch as it makes
14519: complete abstraction of the content and attends merely to the logical
14520: form of the cognition.
14521: 
14522: But again, everything, as regards its possibility, is also subject to
14523: the principle of complete determination, according to which one of all
14524: the possible contradictory predicates of things must belong to it. This
14525: principle is not based merely upon that of contradiction; for, in
14526: addition to the relation between two contradictory predicates, it
14527: regards everything as standing in a relation to the sum of
14528: possibilities, as the sum total of all predicates of things, and, while
14529: presupposing this sum as an à priori condition, presents to the mind
14530: everything as receiving the possibility of its individual existence
14531: from the relation it bears to, and the share it possesses in, the
14532: aforesaid sum of possibilities.[64] The principle of complete
14533: determination relates the content and not to the logical form. It is
14534: the principle of the synthesis of all the predicates which are required
14535: to constitute the complete conception of a thing, and not a mere
14536: principle analytical representation, which enounces that one of two
14537: contradictory predicates must belong to a conception. It contains,
14538: moreover, a transcendental presupposition—that, namely, of the material
14539: for all possibility, which must contain à priori the data for this or
14540: that particular possibility.
14541: 
14542:  [64] Thus this principle declares everything to possess a relation to
14543:  a common correlate—the sum-total of possibility, which, if discovered
14544:  to exist in the idea of one individual thing, would establish the
14545:  affinity of all possible things, from the identity of the ground of
14546:  their complete determination. The determinability of every conception
14547:  is subordinate to the universality (Allgemeinheit, universalitas) of
14548:  the principle of excluded middle; the determination of a thing to the
14549:  totality (Allheit, universitas) of all possible predicates.
14550: 
14551: 
14552: The proposition, everything which exists is completely determined,
14553: means not only that one of every pair of given contradictory
14554: attributes, but that one of all possible attributes, is always
14555: predicable of the thing; in it the predicates are not merely compared
14556: logically with each other, but the thing itself is transcendentally
14557: compared with the sum-total of all possible predicates. The proposition
14558: is equivalent to saying: “To attain to a complete knowledge of a thing,
14559: it is necessary to possess a knowledge of everything that is possible,
14560: and to determine it thereby in a positive or negative manner.” The
14561: conception of complete determination is consequently a conception which
14562: cannot be presented in its totality in concreto, and is therefore based
14563: upon an idea, which has its seat in the reason—the faculty which
14564: prescribes to the understanding the laws of its harmonious and perfect
14565: exercise.
14566: 
14567: Now, although this idea of the sum-total of all possibility, in so far
14568: as it forms the condition of the complete determination of everything,
14569: is itself undetermined in relation to the predicates which may
14570: constitute this sum-total, and we cogitate in it merely the sum-total
14571: of all possible predicates—we nevertheless find, upon closer
14572: examination, that this idea, as a primitive conception of the mind,
14573: excludes a large number of predicates—those deduced and those
14574: irreconcilable with others, and that it is evolved as a conception
14575: completely determined à priori. Thus it becomes the conception of an
14576: individual object, which is completely determined by and through the
14577: mere idea, and must consequently be termed an ideal of pure reason.
14578: 
14579: When we consider all possible predicates, not merely logically, but
14580: transcendentally, that is to say, with reference to the content which
14581: may be cogitated as existing in them à priori, we shall find that some
14582: indicate a being, others merely a non-being. The logical negation
14583: expressed in the word not does not properly belong to a conception, but
14584: only to the relation of one conception to another in a judgement, and
14585: is consequently quite insufficient to present to the mind the content
14586: of a conception. The expression not mortal does not indicate that a
14587: non-being is cogitated in the object; it does not concern the content
14588: at all. A transcendental negation, on the contrary, indicates non-being
14589: in itself, and is opposed to transcendental affirmation, the conception
14590: of which of itself expresses a being. Hence this affirmation indicates
14591: a reality, because in and through it objects are considered to be
14592: something—to be things; while the opposite negation, on the other hand,
14593: indicates a mere want, or privation, or absence, and, where such
14594: negations alone are attached to a representation, the non-existence of
14595: anything corresponding to the representation.
14596: 
14597: Now a negation cannot be cogitated as determined, without cogitating at
14598: the same time the opposite affirmation. The man born blind has not the
14599: least notion of darkness, because he has none of light; the vagabond
14600: knows nothing of poverty, because he has never known what it is to be
14601: in comfort;[65] the ignorant man has no conception of his ignorance,
14602: because he has no conception of knowledge. All conceptions of negatives
14603: are accordingly derived or deduced conceptions; and realities contain
14604: the data, and, so to speak, the material or transcendental content of
14605: the possibility and complete determination of all things.
14606: 
14607:  [65] The investigations and calculations of astronomers have taught us
14608:  much that is wonderful; but the most important lesson we have received
14609:  from them is the discovery of the abyss of our ignorance in relation
14610:  to the universe—an ignorance the magnitude of which reason, without
14611:  the information thus derived, could never have conceived. This
14612:  discovery of our deficiencies must produce a great change in the
14613:  determination of the aims of human reason.
14614: 
14615: 
14616: If, therefore, a transcendental substratum lies at the foundation of
14617: the complete determination of things—a substratum which is to form the
14618: fund from which all possible predicates of things are to be supplied,
14619: this substratum cannot be anything else than the idea of a sum-total of
14620: reality (omnitudo realitatis). In this view, negations are nothing but
14621: limitations—a term which could not, with propriety, be applied to them,
14622: if the unlimited (the all) did not form the true basis of our
14623: conception.
14624: 
14625: This conception of a sum-total of reality is the conception of a thing
14626: in itself, regarded as completely determined; and the conception of an
14627: ens realissimum is the conception of an individual being, inasmuch as
14628: it is determined by that predicate of all possible contradictory
14629: predicates, which indicates and belongs to being. It is, therefore, a
14630: transcendental ideal which forms the basis of the complete
14631: determination of everything that exists, and is the highest material
14632: condition of its possibility—a condition on which must rest the
14633: cogitation of all objects with respect to their content. Nay, more,
14634: this ideal is the only proper ideal of which the human mind is capable;
14635: because in this case alone a general conception of a thing is
14636: completely determined by and through itself, and cognized as the
14637: representation of an individuum.
14638: 
14639: The logical determination of a conception is based upon a disjunctive
14640: syllogism, the major of which contains the logical division of the
14641: extent of a general conception, the minor limits this extent to a
14642: certain part, while the conclusion determines the conception by this
14643: part. The general conception of a reality cannot be divided à priori,
14644: because, without the aid of experience, we cannot know any determinate
14645: kinds of reality, standing under the former as the genus. The
14646: transcendental principle of the complete determination of all things is
14647: therefore merely the representation of the sum-total of all reality; it
14648: is not a conception which is the genus of all predicates under itself,
14649: but one which comprehends them all within itself. The complete
14650: determination of a thing is consequently based upon the limitation of
14651: this total of reality, so much being predicated of the thing, while all
14652: that remains over is excluded—a procedure which is in exact agreement
14653: with that of the disjunctive syllogism and the determination of the
14654: objects in the conclusion by one of the members of the division. It
14655: follows that reason, in laying the transcendental ideal at the
14656: foundation of its determination of all possible things, takes a course
14657: in exact analogy with that which it pursues in disjunctive syllogisms—a
14658: proposition which formed the basis of the systematic division of all
14659: transcendental ideas, according to which they are produced in complete
14660: parallelism with the three modes of syllogistic reasoning employed by
14661: the human mind.
14662: 
14663: It is self-evident that reason, in cogitating the necessary complete
14664: determination of things, does not presuppose the existence of a being
14665: corresponding to its ideal, but merely the idea of the ideal—for the
14666: purpose of deducing from the unconditional totality of complete
14667: determination, The ideal is therefore the prototype of all things,
14668: which, as defective copies (ectypa), receive from it the material of
14669: their possibility, and approximate to it more or less, though it is
14670: impossible that they can ever attain to its perfection.
14671: 
14672: The possibility of things must therefore be regarded as derived—except
14673: that of the thing which contains in itself all reality, which must be
14674: considered to be primitive and original. For all negations—and they are
14675: the only predicates by means of which all other things can be
14676: distinguished from the ens realissimum—are mere limitations of a
14677: greater and a higher—nay, the highest reality; and they consequently
14678: presuppose this reality, and are, as regards their content, derived
14679: from it. The manifold nature of things is only an infinitely various
14680: mode of limiting the conception of the highest reality, which is their
14681: common substratum; just as all figures are possible only as different
14682: modes of limiting infinite space. The object of the ideal of reason—an
14683: object existing only in reason itself—is also termed the primal being
14684: (ens originarium); as having no existence superior to him, the supreme
14685: being (ens summum); and as being the condition of all other beings,
14686: which rank under it, the being of all beings (ens entium). But none of
14687: these terms indicate the objective relation of an actually existing
14688: object to other things, but merely that of an idea to conceptions; and
14689: all our investigations into this subject still leave us in perfect
14690: uncertainty with regard to the existence of this being.
14691: 
14692: A primal being cannot be said to consist of many other beings with an
14693: existence which is derivative, for the latter presuppose the former,
14694: and therefore cannot be constitutive parts of it. It follows that the
14695: ideal of the primal being must be cogitated as simple.
14696: 
14697: The deduction of the possibility of all other things from this primal
14698: being cannot, strictly speaking, be considered as a limitation, or as a
14699: kind of division of its reality; for this would be regarding the primal
14700: being as a mere aggregate—which has been shown to be impossible,
14701: although it was so represented in our first rough sketch. The highest
14702: reality must be regarded rather as the ground than as the sum-total of
14703: the possibility of all things, and the manifold nature of things be
14704: based, not upon the limitation of the primal being itself, but upon the
14705: complete series of effects which flow from it. And thus all our powers
14706: of sense, as well as all phenomenal reality, may be with propriety
14707: regarded as belonging to this series of effects, while they could not
14708: have formed parts of the idea, considered as an aggregate. Pursuing
14709: this track, and hypostatizing this idea, we shall find ourselves
14710: authorized to determine our notion of the Supreme Being by means of the
14711: mere conception of a highest reality, as one, simple, all-sufficient,
14712: eternal, and so on—in one word, to determine it in its unconditioned
14713: completeness by the aid of every possible predicate. The conception of
14714: such a being is the conception of God in its transcendental sense, and
14715: thus the ideal of pure reason is the object-matter of a transcendental
14716: theology.
14717: 
14718: But, by such an employment of the transcendental idea, we should be
14719: over stepping the limits of its validity and purpose. For reason placed
14720: it, as the conception of all reality, at the basis of the complete
14721: determination of things, without requiring that this conception be
14722: regarded as the conception of an objective existence. Such an existence
14723: would be purely fictitious, and the hypostatizing of the content of the
14724: idea into an ideal, as an individual being, is a step perfectly
14725: unauthorized. Nay, more, we are not even called upon to assume the
14726: possibility of such an hypothesis, as none of the deductions drawn from
14727: such an ideal would affect the complete determination of things in
14728: general—for the sake of which alone is the idea necessary.
14729: 
14730: It is not sufficient to circumscribe the procedure and the dialectic of
14731: reason; we must also endeavour to discover the sources of this
14732: dialectic, that we may have it in our power to give a rational
14733: explanation of this illusion, as a phenomenon of the human mind. For
14734: the ideal, of which we are at present speaking, is based, not upon an
14735: arbitrary, but upon a natural, idea. The question hence arises: How
14736: happens it that reason regards the possibility of all things as deduced
14737: from a single possibility, that, to wit, of the highest reality, and
14738: presupposes this as existing in an individual and primal being?
14739: 
14740: The answer is ready; it is at once presented by the procedure of
14741: transcendental analytic. The possibility of sensuous objects is a
14742: relation of these objects to thought, in which something (the empirical
14743: form) may be cogitated à priori; while that which constitutes the
14744: matter—the reality of the phenomenon (that element which corresponds to
14745: sensation)—must be given from without, as otherwise it could not even
14746: be cogitated by, nor could its possibility be presentable to the mind.
14747: Now, a sensuous object is completely determined, when it has been
14748: compared with all phenomenal predicates, and represented by means of
14749: these either positively or negatively. But, as that which constitutes
14750: the thing itself—the real in a phenomenon, must be given, and that, in
14751: which the real of all phenomena is given, is experience, one, sole, and
14752: all-embracing—the material of the possibility of all sensuous objects
14753: must be presupposed as given in a whole, and it is upon the limitation
14754: of this whole that the possibility of all empirical objects, their
14755: distinction from each other and their complete determination, are
14756: based. Now, no other objects are presented to us besides sensuous
14757: objects, and these can be given only in connection with a possible
14758: experience; it follows that a thing is not an object to us, unless it
14759: presupposes the whole or sum-total of empirical reality as the
14760: condition of its possibility. Now, a natural illusion leads us to
14761: consider this principle, which is valid only of sensuous objects, as
14762: valid with regard to things in general. And thus we are induced to hold
14763: the empirical principle of our conceptions of the possibility of
14764: things, as phenomena, by leaving out this limitative condition, to be a
14765: transcendental principle of the possibility of things in general.
14766: 
14767: We proceed afterwards to hypostatize this idea of the sum-total of all
14768: reality, by changing the distributive unity of the empirical exercise
14769: of the understanding into the collective unity of an empirical whole—a
14770: dialectical illusion, and by cogitating this whole or sum of experience
14771: as an individual thing, containing in itself all empirical reality.
14772: This individual thing or being is then, by means of the above-mentioned
14773: transcendental subreption, substituted for our notion of a thing which
14774: stands at the head of the possibility of all things, the real
14775: conditions of whose complete determination it presents.[66]
14776: 
14777:  [66] This ideal of the ens realissimum—although merely a mental
14778:  representation—is first objectivized, that is, has an objective
14779:  existence attributed to it, then hypostatized, and finally, by the
14780:  natural progress of reason to the completion of unity, personified, as
14781:  we shall show presently. For the regulative unity of experience is not
14782:  based upon phenomena themselves, but upon the connection of the
14783:  variety of phenomena by the understanding in a consciousness, and thus
14784:  the unity of the supreme reality and the complete determinability of
14785:  all things, seem to reside in a supreme understanding, and,
14786:  consequently, in a conscious intelligence.
14787: 
14788: Section III. Of the Arguments employed by Speculative Reason in Proof
14789: of the Existence of a Supreme Being
14790: 
14791: Notwithstanding the pressing necessity which reason feels, to form some
14792: presupposition that shall serve the understanding as a proper basis for
14793: the complete determination of its conceptions, the idealistic and
14794: factitious nature of such a presupposition is too evident to allow
14795: reason for a moment to persuade itself into a belief of the objective
14796: existence of a mere creation of its own thought. But there are other
14797: considerations which compel reason to seek out some resting place in
14798: the regress from the conditioned to the unconditioned, which is not
14799: given as an actual existence from the mere conception of it, although
14800: it alone can give completeness to the series of conditions. And this is
14801: the natural course of every human reason, even of the most uneducated,
14802: although the path at first entered it does not always continue to
14803: follow. It does not begin from conceptions, but from common experience,
14804: and requires a basis in actual existence. But this basis is insecure,
14805: unless it rests upon the immovable rock of the absolutely necessary.
14806: And this foundation is itself unworthy of trust, if it leave under and
14807: above it empty space, if it do not fill all, and leave no room for a
14808: why or a wherefore, if it be not, in one word, infinite in its reality.
14809: 
14810: If we admit the existence of some one thing, whatever it may be, we
14811: must also admit that there is something which exists necessarily. For
14812: what is contingent exists only under the condition of some other thing,
14813: which is its cause; and from this we must go on to conclude the
14814: existence of a cause which is not contingent, and which consequently
14815: exists necessarily and unconditionally. Such is the argument by which
14816: reason justifies its advances towards a primal being.
14817: 
14818: Now reason looks round for the conception of a being that may be
14819: admitted, without inconsistency, to be worthy of the attribute of
14820: absolute necessity, not for the purpose of inferring à priori, from the
14821: conception of such a being, its objective existence (for if reason
14822: allowed itself to take this course, it would not require a basis in
14823: given and actual existence, but merely the support of pure
14824: conceptions), but for the purpose of discovering, among all our
14825: conceptions of possible things, that conception which possesses no
14826: element inconsistent with the idea of absolute necessity. For that
14827: there must be some absolutely necessary existence, it regards as a
14828: truth already established. Now, if it can remove every existence
14829: incapable of supporting the attribute of absolute necessity, excepting
14830: one—this must be the absolutely necessary being, whether its necessity
14831: is comprehensible by us, that is, deducible from the conception of it
14832: alone, or not.
14833: 
14834: Now that, the conception of which contains a therefore to every
14835: wherefore, which is not defective in any respect whatever, which is
14836: all-sufficient as a condition, seems to be the being of which we can
14837: justly predicate absolute necessity—for this reason, that, possessing
14838: the conditions of all that is possible, it does not and cannot itself
14839: require any condition. And thus it satisfies, in one respect at least,
14840: the requirements of the conception of absolute necessity. In this view,
14841: it is superior to all other conceptions, which, as deficient and
14842: incomplete, do not possess the characteristic of independence of all
14843: higher conditions. It is true that we cannot infer from this that what
14844: does not contain in itself the supreme and complete condition—the
14845: condition of all other things—must possess only a conditioned
14846: existence; but as little can we assert the contrary, for this supposed
14847: being does not possess the only characteristic which can enable reason
14848: to cognize by means of an à priori conception the unconditioned and
14849: necessary nature of its existence.
14850: 
14851: The conception of an ens realissimum is that which best agrees with the
14852: conception of an unconditioned and necessary being. The former
14853: conception does not satisfy all the requirements of the latter; but we
14854: have no choice, we are obliged to adhere to it, for we find that we
14855: cannot do without the existence of a necessary being; and even although
14856: we admit it, we find it out of our power to discover in the whole
14857: sphere of possibility any being that can advance well-grounded claims
14858: to such a distinction.
14859: 
14860: The following is, therefore, the natural course of human reason. It
14861: begins by persuading itself of the existence of some necessary being.
14862: In this being it recognizes the characteristics of unconditioned
14863: existence. It then seeks the conception of that which is independent of
14864: all conditions, and finds it in that which is itself the sufficient
14865: condition of all other things—in other words, in that which contains
14866: all reality. But the unlimited all is an absolute unity, and is
14867: conceived by the mind as a being one and supreme; and thus reason
14868: concludes that the Supreme Being, as the primal basis of all things,
14869: possesses an existence which is absolutely necessary.
14870: 
14871: This conception must be regarded as in some degree satisfactory, if we
14872: admit the existence of a necessary being, and consider that there
14873: exists a necessity for a definite and final answer to these questions.
14874: In such a case, we cannot make a better choice, or rather we have no
14875: choice at all, but feel ourselves obliged to declare in favour of the
14876: absolute unity of complete reality, as the highest source of the
14877: possibility of things. But if there exists no motive for coming to a
14878: definite conclusion, and we may leave the question unanswered till we
14879: have fully weighed both sides—in other words, when we are merely called
14880: upon to decide how much we happen to know about the question, and how
14881: much we merely flatter ourselves that we know—the above conclusion does
14882: not appear to be so great advantage, but, on the contrary, seems
14883: defective in the grounds upon which it is supported.
14884: 
14885: For, admitting the truth of all that has been said, that, namely, the
14886: inference from a given existence (my own, for example) to the existence
14887: of an unconditioned and necessary being is valid and unassailable;
14888: that, in the second place, we must consider a being which contains all
14889: reality, and consequently all the conditions of other things, to be
14890: absolutely unconditioned; and admitting too, that we have thus
14891: discovered the conception of a thing to which may be attributed,
14892: without inconsistency, absolute necessity—it does not follow from all
14893: this that the conception of a limited being, in which the supreme
14894: reality does not reside, is therefore incompatible with the idea of
14895: absolute necessity. For, although I do not discover the element of the
14896: unconditioned in the conception of such a being—an element which is
14897: manifestly existent in the sum-total of all conditions—I am not
14898: entitled to conclude that its existence is therefore conditioned; just
14899: as I am not entitled to affirm, in a hypothetical syllogism, that where
14900: a certain condition does not exist (in the present, completeness, as
14901: far as pure conceptions are concerned), the conditioned does not exist
14902: either. On the contrary, we are free to consider all limited beings as
14903: likewise unconditionally necessary, although we are unable to infer
14904: this from the general conception which we have of them. Thus conducted,
14905: this argument is incapable of giving us the least notion of the
14906: properties of a necessary being, and must be in every respect without
14907: result.
14908: 
14909: This argument continues, however, to possess a weight and an authority,
14910: which, in spite of its objective insufficiency, it has never been
14911: divested of. For, granting that certain responsibilities lie upon us,
14912: which, as based on the ideas of reason, deserve to be respected and
14913: submitted to, although they are incapable of a real or practical
14914: application to our nature, or, in other words, would be
14915: responsibilities without motives, except upon the supposition of a
14916: Supreme Being to give effect and influence to the practical laws: in
14917: such a case we should be bound to obey our conceptions, which, although
14918: objectively insufficient, do, according to the standard of reason,
14919: preponderate over and are superior to any claims that may be advanced
14920: from any other quarter. The equilibrium of doubt would in this case be
14921: destroyed by a practical addition; indeed, Reason would be compelled to
14922: condemn herself, if she refused to comply with the demands of the
14923: judgement, no superior to which we know—however defective her
14924: understanding of the grounds of these demands might be.
14925: 
14926: This argument, although in fact transcendental, inasmuch as it rests
14927: upon the intrinsic insufficiency of the contingent, is so simple and
14928: natural, that the commonest understanding can appreciate its value. We
14929: see things around us change, arise, and pass away; they, or their
14930: condition, must therefore have a cause. The same demand must again be
14931: made of the cause itself—as a datum of experience. Now it is natural
14932: that we should place the highest causality just where we place supreme
14933: causality, in that being, which contains the conditions of all possible
14934: effects, and the conception of which is so simple as that of an
14935: all-embracing reality. This highest cause, then, we regard as
14936: absolutely necessary, because we find it absolutely necessary to rise
14937: to it, and do not discover any reason for proceeding beyond it. Thus,
14938: among all nations, through the darkest polytheism glimmer some faint
14939: sparks of monotheism, to which these idolaters have been led, not from
14940: reflection and profound thought, but by the study and natural progress
14941: of the common understanding.
14942: 
14943: There are only three modes of proving the existence of a Deity, on the
14944: grounds of speculative reason.
14945: 
14946: All the paths conducting to this end begin either from determinate
14947: experience and the peculiar constitution of the world of sense, and
14948: rise, according to the laws of causality, from it to the highest cause
14949: existing apart from the world—or from a purely indeterminate
14950: experience, that is, some empirical existence—or abstraction is made of
14951: all experience, and the existence of a supreme cause is concluded from
14952: à priori conceptions alone. The first is the physico-theological
14953: argument, the second the cosmological, the third the ontological. More
14954: there are not, and more there cannot be.
14955: 
14956: I shall show it is as unsuccessful on the one path—the empirical—as on
14957: the other—the transcendental, and that it stretches its wings in vain,
14958: to soar beyond the world of sense by the mere might of speculative
14959: thought. As regards the order in which we must discuss those arguments,
14960: it will be exactly the reverse of that in which reason, in the progress
14961: of its development, attains to them—the order in which they are placed
14962: above. For it will be made manifest to the reader that, although
14963: experience presents the occasion and the starting-point, it is the
14964: transcendental idea of reason which guides it in its pilgrimage and is
14965: the goal of all its struggles. I shall therefore begin with an
14966: examination of the transcendental argument, and afterwards inquire what
14967: additional strength has accrued to this mode of proof from the addition
14968: of the empirical element.
14969: 
14970: Section IV. Of the Impossibility of an Ontological Proof of the
14971: Existence of God
14972: 
14973: It is evident from what has been said that the conception of an
14974: absolutely necessary being is a mere idea, the objective reality of
14975: which is far from being established by the mere fact that it is a need
14976: of reason. On the contrary, this idea serves merely to indicate a
14977: certain unattainable perfection, and rather limits the operations than,
14978: by the presentation of new objects, extends the sphere of the
14979: understanding. But a strange anomaly meets us at the very threshold;
14980: for the inference from a given existence in general to an absolutely
14981: necessary existence seems to be correct and unavoidable, while the
14982: conditions of the understanding refuse to aid us in forming any
14983: conception of such a being.
14984: 
14985: Philosophers have always talked of an absolutely necessary being, and
14986: have nevertheless declined to take the trouble of conceiving
14987: whether—and how—a being of this nature is even cogitable, not to
14988: mention that its existence is actually demonstrable. A verbal
14989: definition of the conception is certainly easy enough: it is something
14990: the non-existence of which is impossible. But does this definition
14991: throw any light upon the conditions which render it impossible to
14992: cogitate the non-existence of a thing—conditions which we wish to
14993: ascertain, that we may discover whether we think anything in the
14994: conception of such a being or not? For the mere fact that I throw away,
14995: by means of the word unconditioned, all the conditions which the
14996: understanding habitually requires in order to regard anything as
14997: necessary, is very far from making clear whether by means of the
14998: conception of the unconditionally necessary I think of something, or
14999: really of nothing at all.
15000: 
15001: Nay, more, this chance-conception, now become so current, many have
15002: endeavoured to explain by examples which seemed to render any inquiries
15003: regarding its intelligibility quite needless. Every geometrical
15004: proposition—a triangle has three angles—it was said, is absolutely
15005: necessary; and thus people talked of an object which lay out of the
15006: sphere of our understanding as if it were perfectly plain what the
15007: conception of such a being meant.
15008: 
15009: All the examples adduced have been drawn, without exception, from
15010: judgements, and not from things. But the unconditioned necessity of a
15011: judgement does not form the absolute necessity of a thing. On the
15012: contrary, the absolute necessity of a judgement is only a conditioned
15013: necessity of a thing, or of the predicate in a judgement. The
15014: proposition above-mentioned does not enounce that three angles
15015: necessarily exist, but, upon condition that a triangle exists, three
15016: angles must necessarily exist—in it. And thus this logical necessity
15017: has been the source of the greatest delusions. Having formed an à
15018: priori conception of a thing, the content of which was made to embrace
15019: existence, we believed ourselves safe in concluding that, because
15020: existence belongs necessarily to the object of the conception (that is,
15021: under the condition of my positing this thing as given), the existence
15022: of the thing is also posited necessarily, and that it is therefore
15023: absolutely necessary—merely because its existence has been cogitated in
15024: the conception.
15025: 
15026: If, in an identical judgement, I annihilate the predicate in thought,
15027: and retain the subject, a contradiction is the result; and hence I say,
15028: the former belongs necessarily to the latter. But if I suppress both
15029: subject and predicate in thought, no contradiction arises; for there is
15030: nothing at all, and therefore no means of forming a contradiction. To
15031: suppose the existence of a triangle and not that of its three angles,
15032: is self-contradictory; but to suppose the non-existence of both
15033: triangle and angles is perfectly admissible. And so is it with the
15034: conception of an absolutely necessary being. Annihilate its existence
15035: in thought, and you annihilate the thing itself with all its
15036: predicates; how then can there be any room for contradiction?
15037: Externally, there is nothing to give rise to a contradiction, for a
15038: thing cannot be necessary externally; nor internally, for, by the
15039: annihilation or suppression of the thing itself, its internal
15040: properties are also annihilated. God is omnipotent—that is a necessary
15041: judgement. His omnipotence cannot be denied, if the existence of a
15042: Deity is posited—the existence, that is, of an infinite being, the two
15043: conceptions being identical. But when you say, God does not exist,
15044: neither omnipotence nor any other predicate is affirmed; they must all
15045: disappear with the subject, and in this judgement there cannot exist
15046: the least self-contradiction.
15047: 
15048: You have thus seen that when the predicate of a judgement is
15049: annihilated in thought along with the subject, no internal
15050: contradiction can arise, be the predicate what it may. There is no
15051: possibility of evading the conclusion—you find yourselves compelled to
15052: declare: There are certain subjects which cannot be annihilated in
15053: thought. But this is nothing more than saying: There exist subjects
15054: which are absolutely necessary—the very hypothesis which you are called
15055: upon to establish. For I find myself unable to form the slightest
15056: conception of a thing which when annihilated in thought with all its
15057: predicates, leaves behind a contradiction; and contradiction is the
15058: only criterion of impossibility in the sphere of pure à priori
15059: conceptions.
15060: 
15061: Against these general considerations, the justice of which no one can
15062: dispute, one argument is adduced, which is regarded as furnishing a
15063: satisfactory demonstration from the fact. It is affirmed that there is
15064: one and only one conception, in which the non-being or annihilation of
15065: the object is self-contradictory, and this is the conception of an ens
15066: realissimum. It possesses, you say, all reality, and you feel
15067: yourselves justified in admitting the possibility of such a being.
15068: (This I am willing to grant for the present, although the existence of
15069: a conception which is not self-contradictory is far from being
15070: sufficient to prove the possibility of an object.)[67] Now the notion
15071: of all reality embraces in it that of existence; the notion of
15072: existence lies, therefore, in the conception of this possible thing. If
15073: this thing is annihilated in thought, the internal possibility of the
15074: thing is also annihilated, which is self-contradictory.
15075: 
15076:  [67] A conception is always possible, if it is not self-contradictory.
15077:  This is the logical criterion of possibility, distinguishing the
15078:  object of such a conception from the nihil negativum. But it may be,
15079:  notwithstanding, an empty conception, unless the objective reality of
15080:  this synthesis, but which it is generated, is demonstrated; and a
15081:  proof of this kind must be based upon principles of possible
15082:  experience, and not upon the principle of analysis or contradiction.
15083:  This remark may be serviceable as a warning against concluding, from
15084:  the possibility of a conception—which is logical—the possibility of a
15085:  thing—which is real.
15086: 
15087: 
15088: I answer: It is absurd to introduce—under whatever term disguised—into
15089: the conception of a thing, which is to be cogitated solely in reference
15090: to its possibility, the conception of its existence. If this is
15091: admitted, you will have apparently gained the day, but in reality have
15092: enounced nothing but a mere tautology. I ask, is the proposition, this
15093: or that thing (which I am admitting to be possible) exists, an
15094: analytical or a synthetical proposition? If the former, there is no
15095: addition made to the subject of your thought by the affirmation of its
15096: existence; but then the conception in your minds is identical with the
15097: thing itself, or you have supposed the existence of a thing to be
15098: possible, and then inferred its existence from its internal
15099: possibility—which is but a miserable tautology. The word reality in the
15100: conception of the thing, and the word existence in the conception of
15101: the predicate, will not help you out of the difficulty. For, supposing
15102: you were to term all positing of a thing reality, you have thereby
15103: posited the thing with all its predicates in the conception of the
15104: subject and assumed its actual existence, and this you merely repeat in
15105: the predicate. But if you confess, as every reasonable person must,
15106: that every existential proposition is synthetical, how can it be
15107: maintained that the predicate of existence cannot be denied without
15108: contradiction?—a property which is the characteristic of analytical
15109: propositions, alone.
15110: 
15111: I should have a reasonable hope of putting an end for ever to this
15112: sophistical mode of argumentation, by a strict definition of the
15113: conception of existence, did not my own experience teach me that the
15114: illusion arising from our confounding a logical with a real predicate
15115: (a predicate which aids in the determination of a thing) resists almost
15116: all the endeavours of explanation and illustration. A logical predicate
15117: may be what you please, even the subject may be predicated of itself;
15118: for logic pays no regard to the content of a judgement. But the
15119: determination of a conception is a predicate, which adds to and
15120: enlarges the conception. It must not, therefore, be contained in the
15121: conception.
15122: 
15123: Being is evidently not a real predicate, that is, a conception of
15124: something which is added to the conception of some other thing. It is
15125: merely the positing of a thing, or of certain determinations in it.
15126: Logically, it is merely the copula of a judgement. The proposition, God
15127: is omnipotent, contains two conceptions, which have a certain object or
15128: content; the word is, is no additional predicate—it merely indicates
15129: the relation of the predicate to the subject. Now, if I take the
15130: subject (God) with all its predicates (omnipotence being one), and say:
15131: God is, or, There is a God, I add no new predicate to the conception of
15132: God, I merely posit or affirm the existence of the subject with all its
15133: predicates—I posit the object in relation to my conception. The content
15134: of both is the same; and there is no addition made to the conception,
15135: which expresses merely the possibility of the object, by my cogitating
15136: the object—in the expression, it is—as absolutely given or existing.
15137: Thus the real contains no more than the possible. A hundred real
15138: dollars contain no more than a hundred possible dollars. For, as the
15139: latter indicate the conception, and the former the object, on the
15140: supposition that the content of the former was greater than that of the
15141: latter, my conception would not be an expression of the whole object,
15142: and would consequently be an inadequate conception of it. But in
15143: reckoning my wealth there may be said to be more in a hundred real
15144: dollars than in a hundred possible dollars—that is, in the mere
15145: conception of them. For the real object—the dollars—is not analytically
15146: contained in my conception, but forms a synthetical addition to my
15147: conception (which is merely a determination of my mental state),
15148: although this objective reality—this existence—apart from my
15149: conceptions, does not in the least degree increase the aforesaid
15150: hundred dollars.
15151: 
15152: By whatever and by whatever number of predicates—even to the complete
15153: determination of it—I may cogitate a thing, I do not in the least
15154: augment the object of my conception by the addition of the statement:
15155: This thing exists. Otherwise, not exactly the same, but something more
15156: than what was cogitated in my conception, would exist, and I could not
15157: affirm that the exact object of my conception had real existence. If I
15158: cogitate a thing as containing all modes of reality except one, the
15159: mode of reality which is absent is not added to the conception of the
15160: thing by the affirmation that the thing exists; on the contrary, the
15161: thing exists—if it exist at all—with the same defect as that cogitated
15162: in its conception; otherwise not that which was cogitated, but
15163: something different, exists. Now, if I cogitate a being as the highest
15164: reality, without defect or imperfection, the question still
15165: remains—whether this being exists or not? For, although no element is
15166: wanting in the possible real content of my conception, there is a
15167: defect in its relation to my mental state, that is, I am ignorant
15168: whether the cognition of the object indicated by the conception is
15169: possible à posteriori. And here the cause of the present difficulty
15170: becomes apparent. If the question regarded an object of sense merely,
15171: it would be impossible for me to confound the conception with the
15172: existence of a thing. For the conception merely enables me to cogitate
15173: an object as according with the general conditions of experience; while
15174: the existence of the object permits me to cogitate it as contained in
15175: the sphere of actual experience. At the same time, this connection with
15176: the world of experience does not in the least augment the conception,
15177: although a possible perception has been added to the experience of the
15178: mind. But if we cogitate existence by the pure category alone, it is
15179: not to be wondered at, that we should find ourselves unable to present
15180: any criterion sufficient to distinguish it from mere possibility.
15181: 
15182: Whatever be the content of our conception of an object, it is necessary
15183: to go beyond it, if we wish to predicate existence of the object. In
15184: the case of sensuous objects, this is attained by their connection
15185: according to empirical laws with some one of my perceptions; but there
15186: is no means of cognizing the existence of objects of pure thought,
15187: because it must be cognized completely à priori. But all our knowledge
15188: of existence (be it immediately by perception, or by inferences
15189: connecting some object with a perception) belongs entirely to the
15190: sphere of experience—which is in perfect unity with itself; and
15191: although an existence out of this sphere cannot be absolutely declared
15192: to be impossible, it is a hypothesis the truth of which we have no
15193: means of ascertaining.
15194: 
15195: The notion of a Supreme Being is in many respects a highly useful idea;
15196: but for the very reason that it is an idea, it is incapable of
15197: enlarging our cognition with regard to the existence of things. It is
15198: not even sufficient to instruct us as to the possibility of a being
15199: which we do not know to exist. The analytical criterion of possibility,
15200: which consists in the absence of contradiction in propositions, cannot
15201: be denied it. But the connection of real properties in a thing is a
15202: synthesis of the possibility of which an à priori judgement cannot be
15203: formed, because these realities are not presented to us specifically;
15204: and even if this were to happen, a judgement would still be impossible,
15205: because the criterion of the possibility of synthetical cognitions must
15206: be sought for in the world of experience, to which the object of an
15207: idea cannot belong. And thus the celebrated Leibnitz has utterly failed
15208: in his attempt to establish upon à priori grounds the possibility of
15209: this sublime ideal being.
15210: 
15211: The celebrated ontological or Cartesian argument for the existence of a
15212: Supreme Being is therefore insufficient; and we may as well hope to
15213: increase our stock of knowledge by the aid of mere ideas, as the
15214: merchant to augment his wealth by the addition of noughts to his cash
15215: account.
15216: 
15217: Section V. Of the Impossibility of a Cosmological Proof of the
15218: Existence of God
15219: 
15220: It was by no means a natural course of proceeding, but, on the
15221: contrary, an invention entirely due to the subtlety of the schools, to
15222: attempt to draw from a mere idea a proof of the existence of an object
15223: corresponding to it. Such a course would never have been pursued, were
15224: it not for that need of reason which requires it to suppose the
15225: existence of a necessary being as a basis for the empirical regress,
15226: and that, as this necessity must be unconditioned and à priori, reason
15227: is bound to discover a conception which shall satisfy, if possible,
15228: this requirement, and enable us to attain to the à priori cognition of
15229: such a being. This conception was thought to be found in the idea of an
15230: ens realissimum, and thus this idea was employed for the attainment of
15231: a better defined knowledge of a necessary being, of the existence of
15232: which we were convinced, or persuaded, on other grounds. Thus reason
15233: was seduced from her natural courage; and, instead of concluding with
15234: the conception of an ens realissimum, an attempt was made to begin with
15235: it, for the purpose of inferring from it that idea of a necessary
15236: existence which it was in fact called in to complete. Thus arose that
15237: unfortunate ontological argument, which neither satisfies the healthy
15238: common sense of humanity, nor sustains the scientific examination of
15239: the philosopher.
15240: 
15241: The cosmological proof, which we are about to examine, retains the
15242: connection between absolute necessity and the highest reality; but,
15243: instead of reasoning from this highest reality to a necessary
15244: existence, like the preceding argument, it concludes from the given
15245: unconditioned necessity of some being its unlimited reality. The track
15246: it pursues, whether rational or sophistical, is at least natural, and
15247: not only goes far to persuade the common understanding, but shows
15248: itself deserving of respect from the speculative intellect; while it
15249: contains, at the same time, the outlines of all the arguments employed
15250: in natural theology—arguments which always have been, and still will
15251: be, in use and authority. These, however adorned, and hid under
15252: whatever embellishments of rhetoric and sentiment, are at bottom
15253: identical with the arguments we are at present to discuss. This proof,
15254: termed by Leibnitz the argumentum a contingentia mundi, I shall now lay
15255: before the reader, and subject to a strict examination.
15256: 
15257: It is framed in the following manner: If something exists, an
15258: absolutely necessary being must likewise exist. Now I, at least, exist.
15259: Consequently, there exists an absolutely necessary being. The minor
15260: contains an experience, the major reasons from a general experience to
15261: the existence of a necessary being.[68] Thus this argument really
15262: begins at experience, and is not completely à priori, or ontological.
15263: The object of all possible experience being the world, it is called the
15264: cosmological proof. It contains no reference to any peculiar property
15265: of sensuous objects, by which this world of sense might be
15266: distinguished from other possible worlds; and in this respect it
15267: differs from the physico-theological proof, which is based upon the
15268: consideration of the peculiar constitution of our sensuous world.
15269: 
15270:  [68] This inference is too well known to require more detailed
15271:  discussion. It is based upon the spurious transcendental law of
15272:  causality, that everything which is contingent has a cause, which, if
15273:  itself contingent, must also have a cause; and so on, till the series
15274:  of subordinated causes must end with an absolutely necessary cause,
15275:  without which it would not possess completeness.
15276: 
15277: 
15278: The proof proceeds thus: A necessary being can be determined only in
15279: one way, that is, it can be determined by only one of all possible
15280: opposed predicates; consequently, it must be completely determined in
15281: and by its conception. But there is only a single conception of a thing
15282: possible, which completely determines the thing à priori: that is, the
15283: conception of the ens realissimum. It follows that the conception of
15284: the ens realissimum is the only conception by and in which we can
15285: cogitate a necessary being. Consequently, a Supreme Being necessarily
15286: exists.
15287: 
15288: In this cosmological argument are assembled so many sophistical
15289: propositions that speculative reason seems to have exerted in it all
15290: her dialectical skill to produce a transcendental illusion of the most
15291: extreme character. We shall postpone an investigation of this argument
15292: for the present, and confine ourselves to exposing the stratagem by
15293: which it imposes upon us an old argument in a new dress, and appeals to
15294: the agreement of two witnesses, the one with the credentials of pure
15295: reason, and the other with those of empiricism; while, in fact, it is
15296: only the former who has changed his dress and voice, for the purpose of
15297: passing himself off for an additional witness. That it may possess a
15298: secure foundation, it bases its conclusions upon experience, and thus
15299: appears to be completely distinct from the ontological argument, which
15300: places its confidence entirely in pure à priori conceptions. But this
15301: experience merely aids reason in making one step—to the existence of a
15302: necessary being. What the properties of this being are cannot be
15303: learned from experience; and therefore reason abandons it altogether,
15304: and pursues its inquiries in the sphere of pure conception, for the
15305: purpose of discovering what the properties of an absolutely necessary
15306: being ought to be, that is, what among all possible things contain the
15307: conditions (requisita) of absolute necessity. Reason believes that it
15308: has discovered these requisites in the conception of an ens
15309: realissimum—and in it alone, and hence concludes: The ens realissimum
15310: is an absolutely necessary being. But it is evident that reason has
15311: here presupposed that the conception of an ens realissimum is perfectly
15312: adequate to the conception of a being of absolute necessity, that is,
15313: that we may infer the existence of the latter from that of the former—a
15314: proposition which formed the basis of the ontological argument, and
15315: which is now employed in the support of the cosmological argument,
15316: contrary to the wish and professions of its inventors. For the
15317: existence of an absolutely necessary being is given in conceptions
15318: alone. But if I say: “The conception of the ens realissimum is a
15319: conception of this kind, and in fact the only conception which is
15320: adequate to our idea of a necessary being,” I am obliged to admit, that
15321: the latter may be inferred from the former. Thus it is properly the
15322: ontological argument which figures in the cosmological, and constitutes
15323: the whole strength of the latter; while the spurious basis of
15324: experience has been of no further use than to conduct us to the
15325: conception of absolute necessity, being utterly insufficient to
15326: demonstrate the presence of this attribute in any determinate existence
15327: or thing. For when we propose to ourselves an aim of this character, we
15328: must abandon the sphere of experience, and rise to that of pure
15329: conceptions, which we examine with the purpose of discovering whether
15330: any one contains the conditions of the possibility of an absolutely
15331: necessary being. But if the possibility of such a being is thus
15332: demonstrated, its existence is also proved; for we may then assert
15333: that, of all possible beings there is one which possesses the attribute
15334: of necessity—in other words, this being possesses an absolutely
15335: necessary existence.
15336: 
15337: All illusions in an argument are more easily detected when they are
15338: presented in the formal manner employed by the schools, which we now
15339: proceed to do.
15340: 
15341: If the proposition: “Every absolutely necessary being is likewise an
15342: ens realissimum,” is correct (and it is this which constitutes the
15343: nervus probandi of the cosmological argument), it must, like all
15344: affirmative judgements, be capable of conversion—the conversio per
15345: accidens, at least. It follows, then, that some entia realissima are
15346: absolutely necessary beings. But no ens realissimum is in any respect
15347: different from another, and what is valid of some is valid of all. In
15348: this present case, therefore, I may employ simple conversion, and say:
15349: “Every ens realissimum is a necessary being.” But as this proposition
15350: is determined à priori by the conceptions contained in it, the mere
15351: conception of an ens realissimum must possess the additional attribute
15352: of absolute necessity. But this is exactly what was maintained in the
15353: ontological argument, and not recognized by the cosmological, although
15354: it formed the real ground of its disguised and illusory reasoning.
15355: 
15356: Thus the second mode employed by speculative reason of demonstrating
15357: the existence of a Supreme Being, is not only, like the first, illusory
15358: and inadequate, but possesses the additional blemish of an ignoratio
15359: elenchi—professing to conduct us by a new road to the desired goal, but
15360: bringing us back, after a short circuit, to the old path which we had
15361: deserted at its call.
15362: 
15363: I mentioned above that this cosmological argument contains a perfect
15364: nest of dialectical assumptions, which transcendental criticism does
15365: not find it difficult to expose and to dissipate. I shall merely
15366: enumerate these, leaving it to the reader, who must by this time be
15367: well practised in such matters, to investigate the fallacies residing
15368: therein.
15369: 
15370: The following fallacies, for example, are discoverable in this mode of
15371: proof: 1. The transcendental principle: “Everything that is contingent
15372: must have a cause”—a principle without significance, except in the
15373: sensuous world. For the purely intellectual conception of the
15374: contingent cannot produce any synthetical proposition, like that of
15375: causality, which is itself without significance or distinguishing
15376: characteristic except in the phenomenal world. But in the present case
15377: it is employed to help us beyond the limits of its sphere. 2. “From the
15378: impossibility of an infinite ascending series of causes in the world of
15379: sense a first cause is inferred”; a conclusion which the principles of
15380: the employment of reason do not justify even in the sphere of
15381: experience, and still less when an attempt is made to pass the limits
15382: of this sphere. 3. Reason allows itself to be satisfied upon
15383: insufficient grounds, with regard to the completion of this series. It
15384: removes all conditions (without which, however, no conception of
15385: Necessity can take place); and, as after this it is beyond our power to
15386: form any other conceptions, it accepts this as a completion of the
15387: conception it wishes to form of the series. 4. The logical possibility
15388: of a conception of the total of reality (the criterion of this
15389: possibility being the absence of contradiction) is confounded with the
15390: transcendental, which requires a principle of the practicability of
15391: such a synthesis—a principle which again refers us to the world of
15392: experience. And so on.
15393: 
15394: The aim of the cosmological argument is to avoid the necessity of
15395: proving the existence of a necessary being priori from mere
15396: conceptions—a proof which must be ontological, and of which we feel
15397: ourselves quite incapable. With this purpose, we reason from an actual
15398: existence—an experience in general, to an absolutely necessary
15399: condition of that existence. It is in this case unnecessary to
15400: demonstrate its possibility. For after having proved that it exists,
15401: the question regarding its possibility is superfluous. Now, when we
15402: wish to define more strictly the nature of this necessary being, we do
15403: not look out for some being the conception of which would enable us to
15404: comprehend the necessity of its being—for if we could do this, an
15405: empirical presupposition would be unnecessary; no, we try to discover
15406: merely the negative condition (conditio sine qua non), without which a
15407: being would not be absolutely necessary. Now this would be perfectly
15408: admissible in every sort of reasoning, from a consequence to its
15409: principle; but in the present case it unfortunately happens that the
15410: condition of absolute necessity can be discovered in but a single
15411: being, the conception of which must consequently contain all that is
15412: requisite for demonstrating the presence of absolute necessity, and
15413: thus entitle me to infer this absolute necessity à priori. That is, it
15414: must be possible to reason conversely, and say: The thing, to which the
15415: conception of the highest reality belongs, is absolutely necessary. But
15416: if I cannot reason thus—and I cannot, unless I believe in the
15417: sufficiency of the ontological argument—I find insurmountable obstacles
15418: in my new path, and am really no farther than the point from which I
15419: set out. The conception of a Supreme Being satisfies all questions à
15420: priori regarding the internal determinations of a thing, and is for
15421: this reason an ideal without equal or parallel, the general conception
15422: of it indicating it as at the same time an ens individuum among all
15423: possible things. But the conception does not satisfy the question
15424: regarding its existence—which was the purpose of all our inquiries;
15425: and, although the existence of a necessary being were admitted, we
15426: should find it impossible to answer the question: What of all things in
15427: the world must be regarded as such?
15428: 
15429: It is certainly allowable to admit the existence of an all-sufficient
15430: being—a cause of all possible effects—for the purpose of enabling
15431: reason to introduce unity into its mode and grounds of explanation with
15432: regard to phenomena. But to assert that such a being necessarily
15433: exists, is no longer the modest enunciation of an admissible
15434: hypothesis, but the boldest declaration of an apodeictic certainty; for
15435: the cognition of that which is absolutely necessary must itself possess
15436: that character.
15437: 
15438: The aim of the transcendental ideal formed by the mind is either to
15439: discover a conception which shall harmonize with the idea of absolute
15440: necessity, or a conception which shall contain that idea. If the one is
15441: possible, so is the other; for reason recognizes that alone as
15442: absolutely necessary which is necessary from its conception. But both
15443: attempts are equally beyond our power—we find it impossible to satisfy
15444: the understanding upon this point, and as impossible to induce it to
15445: remain at rest in relation to this incapacity.
15446: 
15447: Unconditioned necessity, which, as the ultimate support and stay of all
15448: existing things, is an indispensable requirement of the mind, is an
15449: abyss on the verge of which human reason trembles in dismay. Even the
15450: idea of eternity, terrible and sublime as it is, as depicted by Haller,
15451: does not produce upon the mental vision such a feeling of awe and
15452: terror; for, although it measures the duration of things, it does not
15453: support them. We cannot bear, nor can we rid ourselves of the thought
15454: that a being, which we regard as the greatest of all possible
15455: existences, should say to himself: I am from eternity to eternity;
15456: beside me there is nothing, except that which exists by my will; whence
15457: then am I? Here all sinks away from under us; and the greatest, as the
15458: smallest, perfection, hovers without stay or footing in presence of the
15459: speculative reason, which finds it as easy to part with the one as with
15460: the other.
15461: 
15462: Many physical powers, which evidence their existence by their effects,
15463: are perfectly inscrutable in their nature; they elude all our powers of
15464: observation. The transcendental object which forms the basis of
15465: phenomena, and, in connection with it, the reason why our sensibility
15466: possesses this rather than that particular kind of conditions, are and
15467: must ever remain hidden from our mental vision; the fact is there, the
15468: reason of the fact we cannot see. But an ideal of pure reason cannot be
15469: termed mysterious or inscrutable, because the only credential of its
15470: reality is the need of it felt by reason, for the purpose of giving
15471: completeness to the world of synthetical unity. An ideal is not even
15472: given as a cogitable object, and therefore cannot be inscrutable; on
15473: the contrary, it must, as a mere idea, be based on the constitution of
15474: reason itself, and on this account must be capable of explanation and
15475: solution. For the very essence of reason consists in its ability to
15476: give an account, of all our conceptions, opinions, and assertions—upon
15477: objective, or, when they happen to be illusory and fallacious, upon
15478: subjective grounds.
15479: 
15480: Detection and Explanation of the Dialectical Illusion in all
15481: Transcendental Arguments for the Existence of a Necessary Being.
15482: 
15483: Both of the above arguments are transcendental; in other words, they do
15484: not proceed upon empirical principles. For, although the cosmological
15485: argument professed to lay a basis of experience for its edifice of
15486: reasoning, it did not ground its procedure upon the peculiar
15487: constitution of experience, but upon pure principles of reason—in
15488: relation to an existence given by empirical consciousness; utterly
15489: abandoning its guidance, however, for the purpose of supporting its
15490: assertions entirely upon pure conceptions. Now what is the cause, in
15491: these transcendental arguments, of the dialectical, but natural,
15492: illusion, which connects the conceptions of necessity and supreme
15493: reality, and hypostatizes that which cannot be anything but an idea?
15494: What is the cause of this unavoidable step on the part of reason, of
15495: admitting that some one among all existing things must be necessary,
15496: while it falls back from the assertion of the existence of such a being
15497: as from an abyss? And how does reason proceed to explain this anomaly
15498: to itself, and from the wavering condition of a timid and reluctant
15499: approbation—always again withdrawn—arrive at a calm and settled insight
15500: into its cause?
15501: 
15502: It is something very remarkable that, on the supposition that something
15503: exists, I cannot avoid the inference that something exists necessarily.
15504: Upon this perfectly natural—but not on that account reliable—inference
15505: does the cosmological argument rest. But, let me form any conception
15506: whatever of a thing, I find that I cannot cogitate the existence of the
15507: thing as absolutely necessary, and that nothing prevents me—be the
15508: thing or being what it may—from cogitating its non-existence. I may
15509: thus be obliged to admit that all existing things have a necessary
15510: basis, while I cannot cogitate any single or individual thing as
15511: necessary. In other words, I can never complete the regress through the
15512: conditions of existence, without admitting the existence of a necessary
15513: being; but, on the other hand, I cannot make a commencement from this
15514: being.
15515: 
15516: If I must cogitate something as existing necessarily as the basis of
15517: existing things, and yet am not permitted to cogitate any individual
15518: thing as in itself necessary, the inevitable inference is that
15519: necessity and contingency are not properties of things
15520: themselves—otherwise an internal contradiction would result; that
15521: consequently neither of these principles are objective, but merely
15522: subjective principles of reason—the one requiring us to seek for a
15523: necessary ground for everything that exists, that is, to be satisfied
15524: with no other explanation than that which is complete à priori, the
15525: other forbidding us ever to hope for the attainment of this
15526: completeness, that is, to regard no member of the empirical world as
15527: unconditioned. In this mode of viewing them, both principles, in their
15528: purely heuristic and regulative character, and as concerning merely the
15529: formal interest of reason, are quite consistent with each other. The
15530: one says: “You must philosophize upon nature,” as if there existed a
15531: necessary primal basis of all existing things, solely for the purpose
15532: of introducing systematic unity into your knowledge, by pursuing an
15533: idea of this character—a foundation which is arbitrarily admitted to be
15534: ultimate; while the other warns you to consider no individual
15535: determination, concerning the existence of things, as such an ultimate
15536: foundation, that is, as absolutely necessary, but to keep the way
15537: always open for further progress in the deduction, and to treat every
15538: determination as determined by some other. But if all that we perceive
15539: must be regarded as conditionally necessary, it is impossible that
15540: anything which is empirically given should be absolutely necessary.
15541: 
15542: It follows from this that you must accept the absolutely necessary as
15543: out of and beyond the world, inasmuch as it is useful only as a
15544: principle of the highest possible unity in experience, and you cannot
15545: discover any such necessary existence in the would, the second rule
15546: requiring you to regard all empirical causes of unity as themselves
15547: deduced.
15548: 
15549: The philosophers of antiquity regarded all the forms of nature as
15550: contingent; while matter was considered by them, in accordance with the
15551: judgement of the common reason of mankind, as primal and necessary. But
15552: if they had regarded matter, not relatively—as the substratum of
15553: phenomena, but absolutely and in itself—as an independent existence,
15554: this idea of absolute necessity would have immediately disappeared. For
15555: there is nothing absolutely connecting reason with such an existence;
15556: on the contrary, it can annihilate it in thought, always and without
15557: self-contradiction. But in thought alone lay the idea of absolute
15558: necessity. A regulative principle must, therefore, have been at the
15559: foundation of this opinion. In fact, extension and
15560: impenetrability—which together constitute our conception of matter—form
15561: the supreme empirical principle of the unity of phenomena, and this
15562: principle, in so far as it is empirically unconditioned, possesses the
15563: property of a regulative principle. But, as every determination of
15564: matter which constitutes what is real in it—and consequently
15565: impenetrability—is an effect, which must have a cause, and is for this
15566: reason always derived, the notion of matter cannot harmonize with the
15567: idea of a necessary being, in its character of the principle of all
15568: derived unity. For every one of its real properties, being derived,
15569: must be only conditionally necessary, and can therefore be annihilated
15570: in thought; and thus the whole existence of matter can be so
15571: annihilated or suppressed. If this were not the case, we should have
15572: found in the world of phenomena the highest ground or condition of
15573: unity—which is impossible, according to the second regulative
15574: principle. It follows that matter, and, in general, all that forms part
15575: of the world of sense, cannot be a necessary primal being, nor even a
15576: principle of empirical unity, but that this being or principle must
15577: have its place assigned without the world. And, in this way, we can
15578: proceed in perfect confidence to deduce the phenomena of the world and
15579: their existence from other phenomena, just as if there existed no
15580: necessary being; and we can at the same time, strive without ceasing
15581: towards the attainment of completeness for our deduction, just as if
15582: such a being—the supreme condition of all existences—were presupposed
15583: by the mind.
15584: 
15585: These remarks will have made it evident to the reader that the ideal of
15586: the Supreme Being, far from being an enouncement of the existence of a
15587: being in itself necessary, is nothing more than a regulative principle
15588: of reason, requiring us to regard all connection existing between
15589: phenomena as if it had its origin from an all-sufficient necessary
15590: cause, and basing upon this the rule of a systematic and necessary
15591: unity in the explanation of phenomena. We cannot, at the same time,
15592: avoid regarding, by a transcendental subreptio, this formal principle
15593: as constitutive, and hypostatizing this unity. Precisely similar is the
15594: case with our notion of space. Space is the primal condition of all
15595: forms, which are properly just so many different limitations of it; and
15596: thus, although it is merely a principle of sensibility, we cannot help
15597: regarding it as an absolutely necessary and self-subsistent thing—as an
15598: object given à priori in itself. In the same way, it is quite natural
15599: that, as the systematic unity of nature cannot be established as a
15600: principle for the empirical employment of reason, unless it is based
15601: upon the idea of an ens realissimum, as the supreme cause, we should
15602: regard this idea as a real object, and this object, in its character of
15603: supreme condition, as absolutely necessary, and that in this way a
15604: regulative should be transformed into a constitutive principle. This
15605: interchange becomes evident when I regard this supreme being, which,
15606: relatively to the world, was absolutely (unconditionally) necessary, as
15607: a thing per se. In this case, I find it impossible to represent this
15608: necessity in or by any conception, and it exists merely in my own mind,
15609: as the formal condition of thought, but not as a material and
15610: hypostatic condition of existence.
15611: 
15612: Section VI. Of the Impossibility of a Physico-Theological Proof
15613: 
15614: If, then, neither a pure conception nor the general experience of an
15615: existing being can provide a sufficient basis for the proof of the
15616: existence of the Deity, we can make the attempt by the only other
15617: mode—that of grounding our argument upon a determinate experience of
15618: the phenomena of the present world, their constitution and disposition,
15619: and discover whether we can thus attain to a sound conviction of the
15620: existence of a Supreme Being. This argument we shall term the
15621: physico-theological argument. If it is shown to be insufficient,
15622: speculative reason cannot present us with any satisfactory proof of the
15623: existence of a being corresponding to our transcendental idea.
15624: 
15625: It is evident from the remarks that have been made in the preceding
15626: sections, that an answer to this question will be far from being
15627: difficult or unconvincing. For how can any experience be adequate with
15628: an idea? The very essence of an idea consists in the fact that no
15629: experience can ever be discovered congruent or adequate with it. The
15630: transcendental idea of a necessary and all-sufficient being is so
15631: immeasurably great, so high above all that is empirical, which is
15632: always conditioned, that we hope in vain to find materials in the
15633: sphere of experience sufficiently ample for our conception, and in vain
15634: seek the unconditioned among things that are conditioned, while
15635: examples, nay, even guidance is denied us by the laws of empirical
15636: synthesis.
15637: 
15638: If the Supreme Being forms a link in the chain of empirical conditions,
15639: it must be a member of the empirical series, and, like the lower
15640: members which it precedes, have its origin in some higher member of the
15641: series. If, on the other hand, we disengage it from the chain, and
15642: cogitate it as an intelligible being, apart from the series of natural
15643: causes—how shall reason bridge the abyss that separates the latter from
15644: the former? All laws respecting the regress from effects to causes, all
15645: synthetical additions to our knowledge relate solely to possible
15646: experience and the objects of the sensuous world, and, apart from them,
15647: are without significance.
15648: 
15649: The world around us opens before our view so magnificent a spectacle of
15650: order, variety, beauty, and conformity to ends, that whether we pursue
15651: our observations into the infinity of space in the one direction, or
15652: into its illimitable divisions in the other, whether we regard the
15653: world in its greatest or its least manifestations—even after we have
15654: attained to the highest summit of knowledge which our weak minds can
15655: reach, we find that language in the presence of wonders so
15656: inconceivable has lost its force, and number its power to reckon, nay,
15657: even thought fails to conceive adequately, and our conception of the
15658: whole dissolves into an astonishment without power of expression—all
15659: the more eloquent that it is dumb. Everywhere around us we observe a
15660: chain of causes and effects, of means and ends, of death and birth;
15661: and, as nothing has entered of itself into the condition in which we
15662: find it, we are constantly referred to some other thing, which itself
15663: suggests the same inquiry regarding its cause, and thus the universe
15664: must sink into the abyss of nothingness, unless we admit that, besides
15665: this infinite chain of contingencies, there exists something that is
15666: primal and self-subsistent—something which, as the cause of this
15667: phenomenal world, secures its continuance and preservation.
15668: 
15669: This highest cause—what magnitude shall we attribute to it? Of the
15670: content of the world we are ignorant; still less can we estimate its
15671: magnitude by comparison with the sphere of the possible. But this
15672: supreme cause being a necessity of the human mind, what is there to
15673: prevent us from attributing to it such a degree of perfection as to
15674: place it above the sphere of all that is possible? This we can easily
15675: do, although only by the aid of the faint outline of an abstract
15676: conception, by representing this being to ourselves as containing in
15677: itself, as an individual substance, all possible perfection—a
15678: conception which satisfies that requirement of reason which demands
15679: parsimony in principles, which is free from self-contradiction, which
15680: even contributes to the extension of the employment of reason in
15681: experience, by means of the guidance afforded by this idea to order and
15682: system, and which in no respect conflicts with any law of experience.
15683: 
15684: This argument always deserves to be mentioned with respect. It is the
15685: oldest, the clearest, and that most in conformity with the common
15686: reason of humanity. It animates the study of nature, as it itself
15687: derives its existence and draws ever new strength from that source. It
15688: introduces aims and ends into a sphere in which our observation could
15689: not of itself have discovered them, and extends our knowledge of
15690: nature, by directing our attention to a unity, the principle of which
15691: lies beyond nature. This knowledge of nature again reacts upon this
15692: idea—its cause; and thus our belief in a divine author of the universe
15693: rises to the power of an irresistible conviction.
15694: 
15695: For these reasons it would be utterly hopeless to attempt to rob this
15696: argument of the authority it has always enjoyed. The mind, unceasingly
15697: elevated by these considerations, which, although empirical, are so
15698: remarkably powerful, and continually adding to their force, will not
15699: suffer itself to be depressed by the doubts suggested by subtle
15700: speculation; it tears itself out of this state of uncertainty, the
15701: moment it casts a look upon the wondrous forms of nature and the
15702: majesty of the universe, and rises from height to height, from
15703: condition to condition, till it has elevated itself to the supreme and
15704: unconditioned author of all.
15705: 
15706: But although we have nothing to object to the reasonableness and
15707: utility of this procedure, but have rather to commend and encourage it,
15708: we cannot approve of the claims which this argument advances to
15709: demonstrative certainty and to a reception upon its own merits, apart
15710: from favour or support by other arguments. Nor can it injure the cause
15711: of morality to endeavour to lower the tone of the arrogant sophist, and
15712: to teach him that modesty and moderation which are the properties of a
15713: belief that brings calm and content into the mind, without prescribing
15714: to it an unworthy subjection. I maintain, then, that the
15715: physico-theological argument is insufficient of itself to prove the
15716: existence of a Supreme Being, that it must entrust this to the
15717: ontological argument—to which it serves merely as an introduction, and
15718: that, consequently, this argument contains the only possible ground of
15719: proof (possessed by speculative reason) for the existence of this
15720: being.
15721: 
15722: The chief momenta in the physico-theological argument are as follow: 1.
15723: We observe in the world manifest signs of an arrangement full of
15724: purpose, executed with great wisdom, and argument in whole of a content
15725: indescribably various, and of an extent without limits. 2. This
15726: arrangement of means and ends is entirely foreign to the things
15727: existing in the world—it belongs to them merely as a contingent
15728: attribute; in other words, the nature of different things could not of
15729: itself, whatever means were employed, harmoniously tend towards certain
15730: purposes, were they not chosen and directed for these purposes by a
15731: rational and disposing principle, in accordance with certain
15732: fundamental ideas. 3. There exists, therefore, a sublime and wise cause
15733: (or several), which is not merely a blind, all-powerful nature,
15734: producing the beings and events which fill the world in unconscious
15735: fecundity, but a free and intelligent cause of the world. 4. The unity
15736: of this cause may be inferred from the unity of the reciprocal relation
15737: existing between the parts of the world, as portions of an artistic
15738: edifice—an inference which all our observation favours, and all
15739: principles of analogy support.
15740: 
15741: In the above argument, it is inferred from the analogy of certain
15742: products of nature with those of human art, when it compels Nature to
15743: bend herself to its purposes, as in the case of a house, a ship, or a
15744: watch, that the same kind of causality—namely, understanding and
15745: will—resides in nature. It is also declared that the internal
15746: possibility of this freely-acting nature (which is the source of all
15747: art, and perhaps also of human reason) is derivable from another and
15748: superhuman art—a conclusion which would perhaps be found incapable of
15749: standing the test of subtle transcendental criticism. But to neither of
15750: these opinions shall we at present object. We shall only remark that it
15751: must be confessed that, if we are to discuss the subject of cause at
15752: all, we cannot proceed more securely than with the guidance of the
15753: analogy subsisting between nature and such products of design—these
15754: being the only products whose causes and modes of organization are
15755: completely known to us. Reason would be unable to satisfy her own
15756: requirements, if she passed from a causality which she does know, to
15757: obscure and indemonstrable principles of explanation which she does not
15758: know.
15759: 
15760: According to the physico-theological argument, the connection and
15761: harmony existing in the world evidence the contingency of the form
15762: merely, but not of the matter, that is, of the substance of the world.
15763: To establish the truth of the latter opinion, it would be necessary to
15764: prove that all things would be in themselves incapable of this harmony
15765: and order, unless they were, even as regards their substance, the
15766: product of a supreme wisdom. But this would require very different
15767: grounds of proof from those presented by the analogy with human art.
15768: This proof can at most, therefore, demonstrate the existence of an
15769: architect of the world, whose efforts are limited by the capabilities
15770: of the material with which he works, but not of a creator of the world,
15771: to whom all things are subject. Thus this argument is utterly
15772: insufficient for the task before us—a demonstration of the existence of
15773: an all-sufficient being. If we wish to prove the contingency of matter,
15774: we must have recourse to a transcendental argument, which the
15775: physico-theological was constructed expressly to avoid.
15776: 
15777: We infer, from the order and design visible in the universe, as a
15778: disposition of a thoroughly contingent character, the existence of a
15779: cause proportionate thereto. The conception of this cause must contain
15780: certain determinate qualities, and it must therefore be regarded as the
15781: conception of a being which possesses all power, wisdom, and so on, in
15782: one word, all perfection—the conception, that is, of an all-sufficient
15783: being. For the predicates of very great, astonishing, or immeasurable
15784: power and excellence, give us no determinate conception of the thing,
15785: nor do they inform us what the thing may be in itself. They merely
15786: indicate the relation existing between the magnitude of the object and
15787: the observer, who compares it with himself and with his own power of
15788: comprehension, and are mere expressions of praise and reverence, by
15789: which the object is either magnified, or the observing subject
15790: depreciated in relation to the object. Where we have to do with the
15791: magnitude (of the perfection) of a thing, we can discover no
15792: determinate conception, except that which comprehends all possible
15793: perfection or completeness, and it is only the total (omnitudo) of
15794: reality which is completely determined in and through its conception
15795: alone.
15796: 
15797: Now it cannot be expected that any one will be bold enough to declare
15798: that he has a perfect insight into the relation which the magnitude of
15799: the world he contemplates bears (in its extent as well as in its
15800: content) to omnipotence, into that of the order and design in the world
15801: to the highest wisdom, and that of the unity of the world to the
15802: absolute unity of a Supreme Being. Physico-theology is therefore
15803: incapable of presenting a determinate conception of a supreme cause of
15804: the world, and is therefore insufficient as a principle of theology—a
15805: theology which is itself to be the basis of religion.
15806: 
15807: The attainment of absolute totality is completely impossible on the
15808: path of empiricism. And yet this is the path pursued in the
15809: physico-theological argument. What means shall we employ to bridge the
15810: abyss?
15811: 
15812: After elevating ourselves to admiration of the magnitude of the power,
15813: wisdom, and other attributes of the author of the world, and finding we
15814: can advance no further, we leave the argument on empirical grounds, and
15815: proceed to infer the contingency of the world from the order and
15816: conformity to aims that are observable in it. From this contingency we
15817: infer, by the help of transcendental conceptions alone, the existence
15818: of something absolutely necessary; and, still advancing, proceed from
15819: the conception of the absolute necessity of the first cause to the
15820: completely determined or determining conception thereof—the conception
15821: of an all-embracing reality. Thus the physico-theological, failing in
15822: its undertaking, recurs in its embarrassment to the cosmological
15823: argument; and, as this is merely the ontological argument in disguise,
15824: it executes its design solely by the aid of pure reason, although it at
15825: first professed to have no connection with this faculty and to base its
15826: entire procedure upon experience alone.
15827: 
15828: The physico-theologians have therefore no reason to regard with such
15829: contempt the transcendental mode of argument, and to look down upon it,
15830: with the conceit of clear-sighted observers of nature, as the
15831: brain-cobweb of obscure speculatists. For, if they reflect upon and
15832: examine their own arguments, they will find that, after following for
15833: some time the path of nature and experience, and discovering themselves
15834: no nearer their object, they suddenly leave this path and pass into the
15835: region of pure possibility, where they hope to reach upon the wings of
15836: ideas what had eluded all their empirical investigations. Gaining, as
15837: they think, a firm footing after this immense leap, they extend their
15838: determinate conception—into the possession of which they have come,
15839: they know not how—over the whole sphere of creation, and explain their
15840: ideal, which is entirely a product of pure reason, by illustrations
15841: drawn from experience—though in a degree miserably unworthy of the
15842: grandeur of the object, while they refuse to acknowledge that they have
15843: arrived at this cognition or hypothesis by a very different road from
15844: that of experience.
15845: 
15846: Thus the physico-theological is based upon the cosmological, and this
15847: upon the ontological proof of the existence of a Supreme Being; and as
15848: besides these three there is no other path open to speculative reason,
15849: the ontological proof, on the ground of pure conceptions of reason, is
15850: the only possible one, if any proof of a proposition so far
15851: transcending the empirical exercise of the understanding is possible at
15852: all.
15853: 
15854: Section VII. Critique of all Theology based upon Speculative Principles
15855: of Reason
15856: 
15857: If by the term theology I understand the cognition of a primal being,
15858: that cognition is based either upon reason alone (theologia rationalis)
15859: or upon revelation (theologia revelata). The former cogitates its
15860: object either by means of pure transcendental conceptions, as an ens
15861: originarium, realissimum, ens entium, and is termed transcendental
15862: theology; or, by means of a conception derived from the nature of our
15863: own mind, as a supreme intelligence, and must then be entitled natural
15864: theology. The person who believes in a transcendental theology alone,
15865: is termed a deist; he who acknowledges the possibility of a natural
15866: theology also, a theist. The former admits that we can cognize by pure
15867: reason alone the existence of a Supreme Being, but at the same time
15868: maintains that our conception of this being is purely transcendental,
15869: and that all we can say of it is that it possesses all reality, without
15870: being able to define it more closely. The second asserts that reason is
15871: capable of presenting us, from the analogy with nature, with a more
15872: definite conception of this being, and that its operations, as the
15873: cause of all things, are the results of intelligence and free will. The
15874: former regards the Supreme Being as the cause of the world—whether by
15875: the necessity of his nature, or as a free agent, is left undetermined;
15876: the latter considers this being as the author of the world.
15877: 
15878: Transcendental theology aims either at inferring the existence of a
15879: Supreme Being from a general experience, without any closer reference
15880: to the world to which this experience belongs, and in this case it is
15881: called cosmotheology; or it endeavours to cognize the existence of such
15882: a being, through mere conceptions, without the aid of experience, and
15883: is then termed ontotheology.
15884: 
15885: Natural theology infers the attributes and the existence of an author
15886: of the world, from the constitution of, the order and unity observable
15887: in, the world, in which two modes of causality must be admitted to
15888: exist—those of nature and freedom. Thus it rises from this world to a
15889: supreme intelligence, either as the principle of all natural, or of all
15890: moral order and perfection. In the former case it is termed
15891: physico-theology, in the latter, ethical or moral-theology.[69]
15892: 
15893:  [69] Not theological ethics; for this science contains ethical laws,
15894:  which presuppose the existence of a Supreme Governor of the world;
15895:  while moral-theology, on the contrary, is the expression of a
15896:  conviction of the existence of a Supreme Being, founded upon ethical
15897:  laws.
15898: 
15899: 
15900: As we are wont to understand by the term God not merely an eternal
15901: nature, the operations of which are insensate and blind, but a Supreme
15902: Being, who is the free and intelligent author of all things, and as it
15903: is this latter view alone that can be of interest to humanity, we
15904: might, in strict rigour, deny to the deist any belief in God at all,
15905: and regard him merely as a maintainer of the existence of a primal
15906: being or thing—the supreme cause of all other things. But, as no one
15907: ought to be blamed, merely because he does not feel himself justified
15908: in maintaining a certain opinion, as if he altogether denied its truth
15909: and asserted the opposite, it is more correct—as it is less harsh—to
15910: say, the deist believes in a God, the theist in a living God (summa
15911: intelligentia). We shall now proceed to investigate the sources of all
15912: these attempts of reason to establish the existence of a Supreme Being.
15913: 
15914: It may be sufficient in this place to define theoretical knowledge or
15915: cognition as knowledge of that which is, and practical knowledge as
15916: knowledge of that which ought to be. In this view, the theoretical
15917: employment of reason is that by which I cognize à priori (as necessary)
15918: that something is, while the practical is that by which I cognize à
15919: priori what ought to happen. Now, if it is an indubitably certain,
15920: though at the same time an entirely conditioned truth, that something
15921: is, or ought to happen, either a certain determinate condition of this
15922: truth is absolutely necessary, or such a condition may be arbitrarily
15923: presupposed. In the former case the condition is postulated (per
15924: thesin), in the latter supposed (per hypothesin). There are certain
15925: practical laws—those of morality—which are absolutely necessary. Now,
15926: if these laws necessarily presuppose the existence of some being, as
15927: the condition of the possibility of their obligatory power, this being
15928: must be postulated, because the conditioned, from which we reason to
15929: this determinate condition, is itself cognized à priori as absolutely
15930: necessary. We shall at some future time show that the moral laws not
15931: merely presuppose the existence of a Supreme Being, but also, as
15932: themselves absolutely necessary in a different relation, demand or
15933: postulate it—although only from a practical point of view. The
15934: discussion of this argument we postpone for the present.
15935: 
15936: When the question relates merely to that which is, not to that which
15937: ought to be, the conditioned which is presented in experience is always
15938: cogitated as contingent. For this reason its condition cannot be
15939: regarded as absolutely necessary, but merely as relatively necessary,
15940: or rather as needful; the condition is in itself and à priori a mere
15941: arbitrary presupposition in aid of the cognition, by reason, of the
15942: conditioned. If, then, we are to possess a theoretical cognition of the
15943: absolute necessity of a thing, we cannot attain to this cognition
15944: otherwise than à priori by means of conceptions; while it is impossible
15945: in this way to cognize the existence of a cause which bears any
15946: relation to an existence given in experience.
15947: 
15948: Theoretical cognition is speculative when it relates to an object or
15949: certain conceptions of an object which is not given and cannot be
15950: discovered by means of experience. It is opposed to the cognition of
15951: nature, which concerns only those objects or predicates which can be
15952: presented in a possible experience.
15953: 
15954: The principle that everything which happens (the empirically
15955: contingent) must have a cause, is a principle of the cognition of
15956: nature, but not of speculative cognition. For, if we change it into an
15957: abstract principle, and deprive it of its reference to experience and
15958: the empirical, we shall find that it cannot with justice be regarded
15959: any longer as a synthetical proposition, and that it is impossible to
15960: discover any mode of transition from that which exists to something
15961: entirely different—termed cause. Nay, more, the conception of a cause
15962: likewise that of the contingent—loses, in this speculative mode of
15963: employing it, all significance, for its objective reality and meaning
15964: are comprehensible from experience alone.
15965: 
15966: When from the existence of the universe and the things in it the
15967: existence of a cause of the universe is inferred, reason is proceeding
15968: not in the natural, but in the speculative method. For the principle of
15969: the former enounces, not that things themselves or substances, but only
15970: that which happens or their states—as empirically contingent, have a
15971: cause: the assertion that the existence of substance itself is
15972: contingent is not justified by experience, it is the assertion of a
15973: reason employing its principles in a speculative manner. If, again, I
15974: infer from the form of the universe, from the way in which all things
15975: are connected and act and react upon each other, the existence of a
15976: cause entirely distinct from the universe—this would again be a
15977: judgement of purely speculative reason; because the object in this
15978: case—the cause—can never be an object of possible experience. In both
15979: these cases the principle of causality, which is valid only in the
15980: field of experience—useless and even meaningless beyond this region,
15981: would be diverted from its proper destination.
15982: 
15983: Now I maintain that all attempts of reason to establish a theology by
15984: the aid of speculation alone are fruitless, that the principles of
15985: reason as applied to nature do not conduct us to any theological
15986: truths, and, consequently, that a rational theology can have no
15987: existence, unless it is founded upon the laws of morality. For all
15988: synthetical principles of the understanding are valid only as immanent
15989: in experience; while the cognition of a Supreme Being necessitates
15990: their being employed transcendentally, and of this the understanding is
15991: quite incapable. If the empirical law of causality is to conduct us to
15992: a Supreme Being, this being must belong to the chain of empirical
15993: objects—in which case it would be, like all phenomena, itself
15994: conditioned. If the possibility of passing the limits of experience be
15995: admitted, by means of the dynamical law of the relation of an effect to
15996: its cause, what kind of conception shall we obtain by this procedure?
15997: Certainly not the conception of a Supreme Being, because experience
15998: never presents us with the greatest of all possible effects, and it is
15999: only an effect of this character that could witness to the existence of
16000: a corresponding cause. If, for the purpose of fully satisfying the
16001: requirements of Reason, we recognize her right to assert the existence
16002: of a perfect and absolutely necessary being, this can be admitted only
16003: from favour, and cannot be regarded as the result of irresistible
16004: demonstration. The physico-theological proof may add weight to
16005: others—if other proofs there are—by connecting speculation with
16006: experience; but in itself it rather prepares the mind for theological
16007: cognition, and gives it a right and natural direction, than establishes
16008: a sure foundation for theology.
16009: 
16010: It is now perfectly evident that transcendental questions admit only of
16011: transcendental answers—those presented à priori by pure conceptions
16012: without the least empirical admixture. But the question in the present
16013: case is evidently synthetical—it aims at the extension of our cognition
16014: beyond the bounds of experience—it requires an assurance respecting the
16015: existence of a being corresponding with the idea in our minds, to which
16016: no experience can ever be adequate. Now it has been abundantly proved
16017: that all à priori synthetical cognition is possible only as the
16018: expression of the formal conditions of a possible experience; and that
16019: the validity of all principles depends upon their immanence in the
16020: field of experience, that is, their relation to objects of empirical
16021: cognition or phenomena. Thus all transcendental procedure in reference
16022: to speculative theology is without result.
16023: 
16024: If any one prefers doubting the conclusiveness of the proofs of our
16025: analytic to losing the persuasion of the validity of these old and time
16026: honoured arguments, he at least cannot decline answering the
16027: question—how he can pass the limits of all possible experience by the
16028: help of mere ideas. If he talks of new arguments, or of improvements
16029: upon old arguments, I request him to spare me. There is certainly no
16030: great choice in this sphere of discussion, as all speculative arguments
16031: must at last look for support to the ontological, and I have,
16032: therefore, very little to fear from the argumentative fecundity of the
16033: dogmatical defenders of a non-sensuous reason. Without looking upon
16034: myself as a remarkably combative person, I shall not decline the
16035: challenge to detect the fallacy and destroy the pretensions of every
16036: attempt of speculative theology. And yet the hope of better fortune
16037: never deserts those who are accustomed to the dogmatical mode of
16038: procedure. I shall, therefore, restrict myself to the simple and
16039: equitable demand that such reasoners will demonstrate, from the nature
16040: of the human mind as well as from that of the other sources of
16041: knowledge, how we are to proceed to extend our cognition completely à
16042: priori, and to carry it to that point where experience abandons us, and
16043: no means exist of guaranteeing the objective reality of our
16044: conceptions. In whatever way the understanding may have attained to a
16045: conception, the existence of the object of the conception cannot be
16046: discovered in it by analysis, because the cognition of the existence of
16047: the object depends upon the object’s being posited and given in itself
16048: apart from the conception. But it is utterly impossible to go beyond
16049: our conception, without the aid of experience—which presents to the
16050: mind nothing but phenomena, or to attain by the help of mere
16051: conceptions to a conviction of the existence of new kinds of objects or
16052: supernatural beings.
16053: 
16054: But although pure speculative reason is far from sufficient to
16055: demonstrate the existence of a Supreme Being, it is of the highest
16056: utility in correcting our conception of this being—on the supposition
16057: that we can attain to the cognition of it by some other means—in making
16058: it consistent with itself and with all other conceptions of
16059: intelligible objects, clearing it from all that is incompatible with
16060: the conception of an ens summun, and eliminating from it all
16061: limitations or admixtures of empirical elements.
16062: 
16063: Transcendental theology is still therefore, notwithstanding its
16064: objective insufficiency, of importance in a negative respect; it is
16065: useful as a test of the procedure of reason when engaged with pure
16066: ideas, no other than a transcendental standard being in this case
16067: admissible. For if, from a practical point of view, the hypothesis of a
16068: Supreme and All-sufficient Being is to maintain its validity without
16069: opposition, it must be of the highest importance to define this
16070: conception in a correct and rigorous manner—as the transcendental
16071: conception of a necessary being, to eliminate all phenomenal elements
16072: (anthropomorphism in its most extended signification), and at the same
16073: time to overflow all contradictory assertions—be they atheistic,
16074: deistic, or anthropomorphic. This is of course very easy; as the same
16075: arguments which demonstrated the inability of human reason to affirm
16076: the existence of a Supreme Being must be alike sufficient to prove the
16077: invalidity of its denial. For it is impossible to gain from the pure
16078: speculation of reason demonstration that there exists no Supreme Being,
16079: as the ground of all that exists, or that this being possesses none of
16080: those properties which we regard as analogical with the dynamical
16081: qualities of a thinking being, or that, as the anthropomorphists would
16082: have us believe, it is subject to all the limitations which sensibility
16083: imposes upon those intelligences which exist in the world of
16084: experience.
16085: 
16086: A Supreme Being is, therefore, for the speculative reason, a mere
16087: ideal, though a faultless one—a conception which perfects and crowns
16088: the system of human cognition, but the objective reality of which can
16089: neither be proved nor disproved by pure reason. If this defect is ever
16090: supplied by a moral theology, the problematic transcendental theology
16091: which has preceded, will have been at least serviceable as
16092: demonstrating the mental necessity existing for the conception, by the
16093: complete determination of it which it has furnished, and the ceaseless
16094: testing of the conclusions of a reason often deceived by sense, and not
16095: always in harmony with its own ideas. The attributes of necessity,
16096: infinitude, unity, existence apart from the world (and not as a world
16097: soul), eternity (free from conditions of time), omnipresence (free from
16098: conditions of space), omnipotence, and others, are pure transcendental
16099: predicates; and thus the accurate conception of a Supreme Being, which
16100: every theology requires, is furnished by transcendental theology alone.
16101: 
16102: APPENDIX. Of the Regulative Employment of the Ideas of Pure Reason
16103: 
16104: The result of all the dialectical attempts of pure reason not only
16105: confirms the truth of what we have already proved in our Transcendental
16106: Analytic, namely, that all inferences which would lead us beyond the
16107: limits of experience are fallacious and groundless, but it at the same
16108: time teaches us this important lesson, that human reason has a natural
16109: inclination to overstep these limits, and that transcendental ideas are
16110: as much the natural property of the reason as categories are of the
16111: understanding. There exists this difference, however, that while the
16112: categories never mislead us, outward objects being always in perfect
16113: harmony therewith, ideas are the parents of irresistible illusions, the
16114: severest and most subtle criticism being required to save us from the
16115: fallacies which they induce.
16116: 
16117: Whatever is grounded in the nature of our powers will be found to be in
16118: harmony with the final purpose and proper employment of these powers,
16119: when once we have discovered their true direction and aim. We are
16120: entitled to suppose, therefore, that there exists a mode of employing
16121: transcendental ideas which is proper and immanent; although, when we
16122: mistake their meaning, and regard them as conceptions of actual things,
16123: their mode of application is transcendent and delusive. For it is not
16124: the idea itself, but only the employment of the idea in relation to
16125: possible experience, that is transcendent or immanent. An idea is
16126: employed transcendently, when it is applied to an object falsely
16127: believed to be adequate with and to correspond to it; imminently, when
16128: it is applied solely to the employment of the understanding in the
16129: sphere of experience. Thus all errors of subreptio—of misapplication,
16130: are to be ascribed to defects of judgement, and not to understanding or
16131: reason.
16132: 
16133: Reason never has an immediate relation to an object; it relates
16134: immediately to the understanding alone. It is only through the
16135: understanding that it can be employed in the field of experience. It
16136: does not form conceptions of objects, it merely arranges them and gives
16137: to them that unity which they are capable of possessing when the sphere
16138: of their application has been extended as widely as possible. Reason
16139: avails itself of the conception of the understanding for the sole
16140: purpose of producing totality in the different series. This totality
16141: the understanding does not concern itself with; its only occupation is
16142: the connection of experiences, by which series of conditions in
16143: accordance with conceptions are established. The object of reason is,
16144: therefore, the understanding and its proper destination. As the latter
16145: brings unity into the diversity of objects by means of its conceptions,
16146: so the former brings unity into the diversity of conceptions by means
16147: of ideas; as it sets the final aim of a collective unity to the
16148: operations of the understanding, which without this occupies itself
16149: with a distributive unity alone.
16150: 
16151: I accordingly maintain that transcendental ideas can never be employed
16152: as constitutive ideas, that they cannot be conceptions of objects, and
16153: that, when thus considered, they assume a fallacious and dialectical
16154: character. But, on the other hand, they are capable of an admirable and
16155: indispensably necessary application to objects—as regulative ideas,
16156: directing the understanding to a certain aim, the guiding lines towards
16157: which all its laws follow, and in which they all meet in one point.
16158: This point—though a mere idea (focus imaginarius), that is, not a point
16159: from which the conceptions of the understanding do really proceed, for
16160: it lies beyond the sphere of possible experience—serves,
16161: notwithstanding, to give to these conceptions the greatest possible
16162: unity combined with the greatest possible extension. Hence arises the
16163: natural illusion which induces us to believe that these lines proceed
16164: from an object which lies out of the sphere of empirical cognition,
16165: just as objects reflected in a mirror appear to be behind it. But this
16166: illusion—which we may hinder from imposing upon us—is necessary and
16167: unavoidable, if we desire to see, not only those objects which lie
16168: before us, but those which are at a great distance behind us; that is
16169: to say, when, in the present case, we direct the aims of the
16170: understanding, beyond every given experience, towards an extension as
16171: great as can possibly be attained.
16172: 
16173: If we review our cognitions in their entire extent, we shall find that
16174: the peculiar business of reason is to arrange them into a system, that
16175: is to say, to give them connection according to a principle. This unity
16176: presupposes an idea—the idea of the form of a whole (of cognition),
16177: preceding the determinate cognition of the parts, and containing the
16178: conditions which determine à priori to every part its place and
16179: relation to the other parts of the whole system. This idea,
16180: accordingly, demands complete unity in the cognition of the
16181: understanding—not the unity of a contingent aggregate, but that of a
16182: system connected according to necessary laws. It cannot be affirmed
16183: with propriety that this idea is a conception of an object; it is
16184: merely a conception of the complete unity of the conceptions of
16185: objects, in so far as this unity is available to the understanding as a
16186: rule. Such conceptions of reason are not derived from nature; on the
16187: contrary, we employ them for the interrogation and investigation of
16188: nature, and regard our cognition as defective so long as it is not
16189: adequate to them. We admit that such a thing as pure earth, pure water,
16190: or pure air, is not to be discovered. And yet we require these
16191: conceptions (which have their origin in the reason, so far as regards
16192: their absolute purity and completeness) for the purpose of determining
16193: the share which each of these natural causes has in every phenomenon.
16194: Thus the different kinds of matter are all referred to earths, as mere
16195: weight; to salts and inflammable bodies, as pure force; and finally, to
16196: water and air, as the vehicula of the former, or the machines employed
16197: by them in their operations—for the purpose of explaining the chemical
16198: action and reaction of bodies in accordance with the idea of a
16199: mechanism. For, although not actually so expressed, the influence of
16200: such ideas of reason is very observable in the procedure of natural
16201: philosophers.
16202: 
16203: If reason is the faculty of deducing the particular from the general,
16204: and if the general be certain in se and given, it is only necessary
16205: that the judgement should subsume the particular under the general, the
16206: particular being thus necessarily determined. I shall term this the
16207: demonstrative or apodeictic employment of reason. If, however, the
16208: general is admitted as problematical only, and is a mere idea, the
16209: particular case is certain, but the universality of the rule which
16210: applies to this particular case remains a problem. Several particular
16211: cases, the certainty of which is beyond doubt, are then taken and
16212: examined, for the purpose of discovering whether the rule is applicable
16213: to them; and if it appears that all the particular cases which can be
16214: collected follow from the rule, its universality is inferred, and at
16215: the same time, all the causes which have not, or cannot be presented to
16216: our observation, are concluded to be of the same character with those
16217: which we have observed. This I shall term the hypothetical employment
16218: of the reason.
16219: 
16220: The hypothetical exercise of reason by the aid of ideas employed as
16221: problematical conceptions is properly not constitutive. That is to say,
16222: if we consider the subject strictly, the truth of the rule, which has
16223: been employed as an hypothesis, does not follow from the use that is
16224: made of it by reason. For how can we know all the possible cases that
16225: may arise? some of which may, however, prove exceptions to the
16226: universality of the rule. This employment of reason is merely
16227: regulative, and its sole aim is the introduction of unity into the
16228: aggregate of our particular cognitions, and thereby the approximating
16229: of the rule to universality.
16230: 
16231: The object of the hypothetical employment of reason is therefore the
16232: systematic unity of cognitions; and this unity is the criterion of the
16233: truth of a rule. On the other hand, this systematic unity—as a mere
16234: idea—is in fact merely a unity projected, not to be regarded as given,
16235: but only in the light of a problem—a problem which serves, however, as
16236: a principle for the various and particular exercise of the
16237: understanding in experience, directs it with regard to those cases
16238: which are not presented to our observation, and introduces harmony and
16239: consistency into all its operations.
16240: 
16241: All that we can be certain of from the above considerations is that
16242: this systematic unity is a logical principle, whose aim is to assist
16243: the understanding, where it cannot of itself attain to rules, by means
16244: of ideas, to bring all these various rules under one principle, and
16245: thus to ensure the most complete consistency and connection that can be
16246: attained. But the assertion that objects and the understanding by which
16247: they are cognized are so constituted as to be determined to systematic
16248: unity, that this may be postulated à priori, without any reference to
16249: the interest of reason, and that we are justified in declaring all
16250: possible cognitions—empirical and others—to possess systematic unity,
16251: and to be subject to general principles from which, notwithstanding
16252: their various character, they are all derivable such an assertion can
16253: be founded only upon a transcendental principle of reason, which would
16254: render this systematic unity not subjectively and logically—in its
16255: character of a method, but objectively necessary.
16256: 
16257: We shall illustrate this by an example. The conceptions of the
16258: understanding make us acquainted, among many other kinds of unity, with
16259: that of the causality of a substance, which is termed power. The
16260: different phenomenal manifestations of the same substance appear at
16261: first view to be so very dissimilar that we are inclined to assume the
16262: existence of just as many different powers as there are different
16263: effects—as, in the case of the human mind, we have feeling,
16264: consciousness, imagination, memory, wit, analysis, pleasure, desire and
16265: so on. Now we are required by a logical maxim to reduce these
16266: differences to as small a number as possible, by comparing them and
16267: discovering the hidden identity which exists. We must inquire, for
16268: example, whether or not imagination (connected with consciousness),
16269: memory, wit, and analysis are not merely different forms of
16270: understanding and reason. The idea of a fundamental power, the
16271: existence of which no effort of logic can assure us of, is the problem
16272: to be solved, for the systematic representation of the existing variety
16273: of powers. The logical principle of reason requires us to produce as
16274: great a unity as is possible in the system of our cognitions; and the
16275: more the phenomena of this and the other power are found to be
16276: identical, the more probable does it become, that they are nothing but
16277: different manifestations of one and the same power, which may be
16278: called, relatively speaking, a fundamental power. And so with other
16279: cases.
16280: 
16281: These relatively fundamental powers must again be compared with each
16282: other, to discover, if possible, the one radical and absolutely
16283: fundamental power of which they are but the manifestations. But this
16284: unity is purely hypothetical. It is not maintained, that this unity
16285: does really exist, but that we must, in the interest of reason, that
16286: is, for the establishment of principles for the various rules presented
16287: by experience, try to discover and introduce it, so far as is
16288: practicable, into the sphere of our cognitions.
16289: 
16290: But the transcendental employment of the understanding would lead us to
16291: believe that this idea of a fundamental power is not problematical, but
16292: that it possesses objective reality, and thus the systematic unity of
16293: the various powers or forces in a substance is demanded by the
16294: understanding and erected into an apodeictic or necessary principle.
16295: For, without having attempted to discover the unity of the various
16296: powers existing in nature, nay, even after all our attempts have
16297: failed, we notwithstanding presuppose that it does exist, and may be,
16298: sooner or later, discovered. And this reason does, not only, as in the
16299: case above adduced, with regard to the unity of substance, but where
16300: many substances, although all to a certain extent homogeneous, are
16301: discoverable, as in the case of matter in general. Here also does
16302: reason presuppose the existence of the systematic unity of various
16303: powers—inasmuch as particular laws of nature are subordinate to general
16304: laws; and parsimony in principles is not merely an economical principle
16305: of reason, but an essential law of nature.
16306: 
16307: We cannot understand, in fact, how a logical principle of unity can of
16308: right exist, unless we presuppose a transcendental principle, by which
16309: such a systematic unit—as a property of objects themselves—is regarded
16310: as necessary à priori. For with what right can reason, in its logical
16311: exercise, require us to regard the variety of forces which nature
16312: displays, as in effect a disguised unity, and to deduce them from one
16313: fundamental force or power, when she is free to admit that it is just
16314: as possible that all forces should be different in kind, and that a
16315: systematic unity is not conformable to the design of nature? In this
16316: view of the case, reason would be proceeding in direct opposition to
16317: her own destination, by setting as an aim an idea which entirely
16318: conflicts with the procedure and arrangement of nature. Neither can we
16319: assert that reason has previously inferred this unity from the
16320: contingent nature of phenomena. For the law of reason which requires us
16321: to seek for this unity is a necessary law, inasmuch as without it we
16322: should not possess a faculty of reason, nor without reason a consistent
16323: and self-accordant mode of employing the understanding, nor, in the
16324: absence of this, any proper and sufficient criterion of empirical
16325: truth. In relation to this criterion, therefore, we must suppose the
16326: idea of the systematic unity of nature to possess objective validity
16327: and necessity.
16328: 
16329: We find this transcendental presupposition lurking in different forms
16330: in the principles of philosophers, although they have neither
16331: recognized it nor confessed to themselves its presence. That the
16332: diversities of individual things do not exclude identity of species,
16333: that the various species must be considered as merely different
16334: determinations of a few genera, and these again as divisions of still
16335: higher races, and so on—that, accordingly, a certain systematic unity
16336: of all possible empirical conceptions, in so far as they can be deduced
16337: from higher and more general conceptions, must be sought for, is a
16338: scholastic maxim or logical principle, without which reason could not
16339: be employed by us. For we can infer the particular from the general,
16340: only in so far as general properties of things constitute the
16341: foundation upon which the particular rest.
16342: 
16343: That the same unity exists in nature is presupposed by philosophers in
16344: the well-known scholastic maxim, which forbids us unnecessarily to
16345: augment the number of entities or principles (entia praeter
16346: necessitatem non esse multiplicanda). This maxim asserts that nature
16347: herself assists in the establishment of this unity of reason, and that
16348: the seemingly infinite diversity of phenomena should not deter us from
16349: the expectation of discovering beneath this diversity a unity of
16350: fundamental properties, of which the aforesaid variety is but a more or
16351: less determined form. This unity, although a mere idea, thinkers have
16352: found it necessary rather to moderate the desire than to encourage it.
16353: It was considered a great step when chemists were able to reduce all
16354: salts to two main genera—acids and alkalis; and they regard this
16355: difference as itself a mere variety, or different manifestation of one
16356: and the same fundamental material. The different kinds of earths
16357: (stones and even metals) chemists have endeavoured to reduce to three,
16358: and afterwards to two; but still, not content with this advance, they
16359: cannot but think that behind these diversities there lurks but one
16360: genus—nay, that even salts and earths have a common principle. It might
16361: be conjectured that this is merely an economical plan of reason, for
16362: the purpose of sparing itself trouble, and an attempt of a purely
16363: hypothetical character, which, when successful, gives an appearance of
16364: probability to the principle of explanation employed by the reason. But
16365: a selfish purpose of this kind is easily to be distinguished from the
16366: idea, according to which every one presupposes that this unity is in
16367: accordance with the laws of nature, and that reason does not in this
16368: case request, but requires, although we are quite unable to determine
16369: the proper limits of this unity.
16370: 
16371: If the diversity existing in phenomena—a diversity not of form (for in
16372: this they may be similar) but of content—were so great that the
16373: subtlest human reason could never by comparison discover in them the
16374: least similarity (which is not impossible), in this case the logical
16375: law of genera would be without foundation, the conception of a genus,
16376: nay, all general conceptions would be impossible, and the faculty of
16377: the understanding, the exercise of which is restricted to the world of
16378: conceptions, could not exist. The logical principle of genera,
16379: accordingly, if it is to be applied to nature (by which I mean objects
16380: presented to our senses), presupposes a transcendental principle. In
16381: accordance with this principle, homogeneity is necessarily presupposed
16382: in the variety of phenomena (although we are unable to determine à
16383: priori the degree of this homogeneity), because without it no empirical
16384: conceptions, and consequently no experience, would be possible.
16385: 
16386: The logical principle of genera, which demands identity in phenomena,
16387: is balanced by another principle—that of species, which requires
16388: variety and diversity in things, notwithstanding their accordance in
16389: the same genus, and directs the understanding to attend to the one no
16390: less than to the other. This principle (of the faculty of distinction)
16391: acts as a check upon the reason and reason exhibits in this respect a
16392: double and conflicting interest—on the one hand, the interest in the
16393: extent (the interest of generality) in relation to genera; on the
16394: other, that of the content (the interest of individuality) in relation
16395: to the variety of species. In the former case, the understanding
16396: cogitates more under its conceptions, in the latter it cogitates more
16397: in them. This distinction manifests itself likewise in the habits of
16398: thought peculiar to natural philosophers, some of whom—the remarkably
16399: speculative heads—may be said to be hostile to heterogeneity in
16400: phenomena, and have their eyes always fixed on the unity of genera,
16401: while others—with a strong empirical tendency—aim unceasingly at the
16402: analysis of phenomena, and almost destroy in us the hope of ever being
16403: able to estimate the character of these according to general
16404: principles.
16405: 
16406: The latter mode of thought is evidently based upon a logical principle,
16407: the aim of which is the systematic completeness of all cognitions. This
16408: principle authorizes me, beginning at the genus, to descend to the
16409: various and diverse contained under it; and in this way extension, as
16410: in the former case unity, is assured to the system. For if we merely
16411: examine the sphere of the conception which indicates a genus, we cannot
16412: discover how far it is possible to proceed in the division of that
16413: sphere; just as it is impossible, from the consideration of the space
16414: occupied by matter, to determine how far we can proceed in the division
16415: of it. Hence every genus must contain different species, and these
16416: again different subspecies; and as each of the latter must itself
16417: contain a sphere (must be of a certain extent, as a conceptus
16418: communis), reason demands that no species or sub-species is to be
16419: considered as the lowest possible. For a species or sub-species, being
16420: always a conception, which contains only what is common to a number of
16421: different things, does not completely determine any individual thing,
16422: or relate immediately to it, and must consequently contain other
16423: conceptions, that is, other sub-species under it. This law of
16424: specification may be thus expressed: entium varietates non temere sunt
16425: minuendae.
16426: 
16427: But it is easy to see that this logical law would likewise be without
16428: sense or application, were it not based upon a transcendental law of
16429: specification, which certainly does not require that the differences
16430: existing phenomena should be infinite in number, for the logical
16431: principle, which merely maintains the indeterminateness of the logical
16432: sphere of a conception, in relation to its possible division, does not
16433: authorize this statement; while it does impose upon the understanding
16434: the duty of searching for subspecies to every species, and minor
16435: differences in every difference. For, were there no lower conceptions,
16436: neither could there be any higher. Now the understanding cognizes only
16437: by means of conceptions; consequently, how far soever it may proceed in
16438: division, never by mere intuition, but always by lower and lower
16439: conceptions. The cognition of phenomena in their complete determination
16440: (which is possible only by means of the understanding) requires an
16441: unceasingly continued specification of conceptions, and a progression
16442: to ever smaller differences, of which abstraction had been made in the
16443: conception of the species, and still more in that of the genus.
16444: 
16445: This law of specification cannot be deduced from experience; it can
16446: never present us with a principle of so universal an application.
16447: Empirical specification very soon stops in its distinction of
16448: diversities, and requires the guidance of the transcendental law, as a
16449: principle of the reason—a law which imposes on us the necessity of
16450: never ceasing in our search for differences, even although these may
16451: not present themselves to the senses. That absorbent earths are of
16452: different kinds could only be discovered by obeying the anticipatory
16453: law of reason, which imposes upon the understanding the task of
16454: discovering the differences existing between these earths, and supposes
16455: that nature is richer in substances than our senses would indicate. The
16456: faculty of the understanding belongs to us just as much under the
16457: presupposition of differences in the objects of nature, as under the
16458: condition that these objects are homogeneous, because we could not
16459: possess conceptions, nor make any use of our understanding, were not
16460: the phenomena included under these conceptions in some respects
16461: dissimilar, as well as similar, in their character.
16462: 
16463: Reason thus prepares the sphere of the understanding for the operations
16464: of this faculty: 1. By the principle of the homogeneity of the diverse
16465: in higher genera; 2. By the principle of the variety of the homogeneous
16466: in lower species; and, to complete the systematic unity, it adds, 3. A
16467: law of the affinity of all conceptions which prescribes a continuous
16468: transition from one species to every other by the gradual increase of
16469: diversity. We may term these the principles of the homogeneity, the
16470: specification, and the continuity of forms. The latter results from the
16471: union of the two former, inasmuch as we regard the systematic
16472: connection as complete in thought, in the ascent to higher genera, as
16473: well as in the descent to lower species. For all diversities must be
16474: related to each other, as they all spring from one highest genus,
16475: descending through the different gradations of a more and more extended
16476: determination.
16477: 
16478: We may illustrate the systematic unity produced by the three logical
16479: principles in the following manner. Every conception may be regarded as
16480: a point, which, as the standpoint of a spectator, has a certain
16481: horizon, which may be said to enclose a number of things that may be
16482: viewed, so to speak, from that centre. Within this horizon there must
16483: be an infinite number of other points, each of which has its own
16484: horizon, smaller and more circumscribed; in other words, every species
16485: contains sub-species, according to the principle of specification, and
16486: the logical horizon consists of smaller horizons (subspecies), but not
16487: of points (individuals), which possess no extent. But different
16488: horizons or genera, which include under them so many conceptions, may
16489: have one common horizon, from which, as from a mid-point, they may be
16490: surveyed; and we may proceed thus, till we arrive at the highest genus,
16491: or universal and true horizon, which is determined by the highest
16492: conception, and which contains under itself all differences and
16493: varieties, as genera, species, and subspecies.
16494: 
16495: To this highest standpoint I am conducted by the law of homogeneity, as
16496: to all lower and more variously-determined conceptions by the law of
16497: specification. Now as in this way there exists no void in the whole
16498: extent of all possible conceptions, and as out of the sphere of these
16499: the mind can discover nothing, there arises from the presupposition of
16500: the universal horizon above mentioned, and its complete division, the
16501: principle: Non datur vacuum formarum. This principle asserts that there
16502: are not different primitive and highest genera, which stand isolated,
16503: so to speak, from each other, but all the various genera are mere
16504: divisions and limitations of one highest and universal genus; and hence
16505: follows immediately the principle: Datur continuum formarum. This
16506: principle indicates that all differences of species limit each other,
16507: and do not admit of transition from one to another by a saltus, but
16508: only through smaller degrees of the difference between the one species
16509: and the other. In one word, there are no species or sub-species which
16510: (in the view of reason) are the nearest possible to each other;
16511: intermediate species or sub-species being always possible, the
16512: difference of which from each of the former is always smaller than the
16513: difference existing between these.
16514: 
16515: The first law, therefore, directs us to avoid the notion that there
16516: exist different primal genera, and enounces the fact of perfect
16517: homogeneity; the second imposes a check upon this tendency to unity and
16518: prescribes the distinction of sub-species, before proceeding to apply
16519: our general conceptions to individuals. The third unites both the
16520: former, by enouncing the fact of homogeneity as existing even in the
16521: most various diversity, by means of the gradual transition from one
16522: species to another. Thus it indicates a relationship between the
16523: different branches or species, in so far as they all spring from the
16524: same stem.
16525: 
16526: But this logical law of the continuum specierum (formarum logicarum)
16527: presupposes a transcendental principle (lex continui in natura),
16528: without which the understanding might be led into error, by following
16529: the guidance of the former, and thus perhaps pursuing a path contrary
16530: to that prescribed by nature. This law must, consequently, be based
16531: upon pure transcendental, and not upon empirical, considerations. For,
16532: in the latter case, it would come later than the system; whereas it is
16533: really itself the parent of all that is systematic in our cognition of
16534: nature. These principles are not mere hypotheses employed for the
16535: purpose of experimenting upon nature; although when any such connection
16536: is discovered, it forms a solid ground for regarding the hypothetical
16537: unity as valid in the sphere of nature—and thus they are in this
16538: respect not without their use. But we go farther, and maintain that it
16539: is manifest that these principles of parsimony in fundamental causes,
16540: variety in effects, and affinity in phenomena, are in accordance both
16541: with reason and nature, and that they are not mere methods or plans
16542: devised for the purpose of assisting us in our observation of the
16543: external world.
16544: 
16545: But it is plain that this continuity of forms is a mere idea, to which
16546: no adequate object can be discovered in experience. And this for two
16547: reasons. First, because the species in nature are really divided, and
16548: hence form quanta discreta; and, if the gradual progression through
16549: their affinity were continuous, the intermediate members lying between
16550: two given species must be infinite in number, which is impossible.
16551: Secondly, because we cannot make any determinate empirical use of this
16552: law, inasmuch as it does not present us with any criterion of affinity
16553: which could aid us in determining how far we ought to pursue the
16554: graduation of differences: it merely contains a general indication that
16555: it is our duty to seek for and, if possible, to discover them.
16556: 
16557: When we arrange these principles of systematic unity in the order
16558: conformable to their employment in experience, they will stand thus:
16559: Variety, Affinity, Unity, each of them, as ideas, being taken in the
16560: highest degree of their completeness. Reason presupposes the existence
16561: of cognitions of the understanding, which have a direct relation to
16562: experience, and aims at the ideal unity of these cognitions—a unity
16563: which far transcends all experience or empirical notions. The affinity
16564: of the diverse, notwithstanding the differences existing between its
16565: parts, has a relation to things, but a still closer one to the mere
16566: properties and powers of things. For example, imperfect experience may
16567: represent the orbits of the planets as circular. But we discover
16568: variations from this course, and we proceed to suppose that the planets
16569: revolve in a path which, if not a circle, is of a character very
16570: similar to it. That is to say, the movements of those planets which do
16571: not form a circle will approximate more or less to the properties of a
16572: circle, and probably form an ellipse. The paths of comets exhibit still
16573: greater variations, for, so far as our observation extends, they do not
16574: return upon their own course in a circle or ellipse. But we proceed to
16575: the conjecture that comets describe a parabola, a figure which is
16576: closely allied to the ellipse. In fact, a parabola is merely an
16577: ellipse, with its longer axis produced to an indefinite extent. Thus
16578: these principles conduct us to a unity in the genera of the forms of
16579: these orbits, and, proceeding farther, to a unity as regards the cause
16580: of the motions of the heavenly bodies—that is, gravitation. But we go
16581: on extending our conquests over nature, and endeavour to explain all
16582: seeming deviations from these rules, and even make additions to our
16583: system which no experience can ever substantiate—for example, the
16584: theory, in affinity with that of ellipses, of hyperbolic paths of
16585: comets, pursuing which, these bodies leave our solar system and,
16586: passing from sun to sun, unite the most distant parts of the infinite
16587: universe, which is held together by the same moving power.
16588: 
16589: The most remarkable circumstance connected with these principles is
16590: that they seem to be transcendental, and, although only containing
16591: ideas for the guidance of the empirical exercise of reason, and
16592: although this empirical employment stands to these ideas in an
16593: asymptotic relation alone (to use a mathematical term), that is,
16594: continually approximate, without ever being able to attain to them,
16595: they possess, notwithstanding, as à priori synthetical propositions,
16596: objective though undetermined validity, and are available as rules for
16597: possible experience. In the elaboration of our experience, they may
16598: also be employed with great advantage, as heuristic[70] principles. A
16599: transcendental deduction of them cannot be made; such a deduction being
16600: always impossible in the case of ideas, as has been already shown.
16601: 
16602:  [70] From the Greek, eurhioko.
16603: 
16604: 
16605: We distinguished, in the Transcendental Analytic, the dynamical
16606: principles of the understanding, which are regulative principles of
16607: intuition, from the mathematical, which are constitutive principles of
16608: intuition. These dynamical laws are, however, constitutive in relation
16609: to experience, inasmuch as they render the conceptions without which
16610: experience could not exist possible à priori. But the principles of
16611: pure reason cannot be constitutive even in regard to empirical
16612: conceptions, because no sensuous schema corresponding to them can be
16613: discovered, and they cannot therefore have an object in concreto. Now,
16614: if I grant that they cannot be employed in the sphere of experience, as
16615: constitutive principles, how shall I secure for them employment and
16616: objective validity as regulative principles, and in what way can they
16617: be so employed?
16618: 
16619: The understanding is the object of reason, as sensibility is the object
16620: of the understanding. The production of systematic unity in all the
16621: empirical operations of the understanding is the proper occupation of
16622: reason; just as it is the business of the understanding to connect the
16623: various content of phenomena by means of conceptions, and subject them
16624: to empirical laws. But the operations of the understanding are, without
16625: the schemata of sensibility, undetermined; and, in the same manner, the
16626: unity of reason is perfectly undetermined as regards the conditions
16627: under which, and the extent to which, the understanding ought to carry
16628: the systematic connection of its conceptions. But, although it is
16629: impossible to discover in intuition a schema for the complete
16630: systematic unity of all the conceptions of the understanding, there
16631: must be some analogon of this schema. This analogon is the idea of the
16632: maximum of the division and the connection of our cognition in one
16633: principle. For we may have a determinate notion of a maximum and an
16634: absolutely perfect, all the restrictive conditions which are connected
16635: with an indeterminate and various content having been abstracted. Thus
16636: the idea of reason is analogous with a sensuous schema, with this
16637: difference, that the application of the categories to the schema of
16638: reason does not present a cognition of any object (as is the case with
16639: the application of the categories to sensuous schemata), but merely
16640: provides us with a rule or principle for the systematic unity of the
16641: exercise of the understanding. Now, as every principle which imposes
16642: upon the exercise of the understanding à priori compliance with the
16643: rule of systematic unity also relates, although only in an indirect
16644: manner, to an object of experience, the principles of pure reason will
16645: also possess objective reality and validity in relation to experience.
16646: But they will not aim at determining our knowledge in regard to any
16647: empirical object; they will merely indicate the procedure, following
16648: which the empirical and determinate exercise of the understanding may
16649: be in complete harmony and connection with itself—a result which is
16650: produced by its being brought into harmony with the principle of
16651: systematic unity, so far as that is possible, and deduced from it.
16652: 
16653: I term all subjective principles, which are not derived from
16654: observation of the constitution of an object, but from the interest
16655: which Reason has in producing a certain completeness in her cognition
16656: of that object, maxims of reason. Thus there are maxims of speculative
16657: reason, which are based solely upon its speculative interest, although
16658: they appear to be objective principles.
16659: 
16660: When principles which are really regulative are regarded as
16661: constitutive, and employed as objective principles, contradictions must
16662: arise; but if they are considered as mere maxims, there is no room for
16663: contradictions of any kind, as they then merely indicate the different
16664: interests of reason, which occasion differences in the mode of thought.
16665: In effect, Reason has only one single interest, and the seeming
16666: contradiction existing between her maxims merely indicates a difference
16667: in, and a reciprocal limitation of, the methods by which this interest
16668: is satisfied.
16669: 
16670: This reasoner has at heart the interest of diversity—in accordance with
16671: the principle of specification; another, the interest of unity—in
16672: accordance with the principle of aggregation. Each believes that his
16673: judgement rests upon a thorough insight into the subject he is
16674: examining, and yet it has been influenced solely by a greater or less
16675: degree of adherence to some one of the two principles, neither of which
16676: are objective, but originate solely from the interest of reason, and on
16677: this account to be termed maxims rather than principles. When I observe
16678: intelligent men disputing about the distinctive characteristics of men,
16679: animals, or plants, and even of minerals, those on the one side
16680: assuming the existence of certain national characteristics, certain
16681: well-defined and hereditary distinctions of family, race, and so on,
16682: while the other side maintain that nature has endowed all races of men
16683: with the same faculties and dispositions, and that all differences are
16684: but the result of external and accidental circumstances—I have only to
16685: consider for a moment the real nature of the subject of discussion, to
16686: arrive at the conclusion that it is a subject far too deep for us to
16687: judge of, and that there is little probability of either party being
16688: able to speak from a perfect insight into and understanding of the
16689: nature of the subject itself. Both have, in reality, been struggling
16690: for the twofold interest of reason; the one maintaining the one
16691: interest, the other the other. But this difference between the maxims
16692: of diversity and unity may easily be reconciled and adjusted; although,
16693: so long as they are regarded as objective principles, they must
16694: occasion not only contradictions and polemic, but place hinderances in
16695: the way of the advancement of truth, until some means is discovered of
16696: reconciling these conflicting interests, and bringing reason into union
16697: and harmony with itself.
16698: 
16699: The same is the case with the so-called law discovered by Leibnitz, and
16700: supported with remarkable ability by Bonnet—the law of the continuous
16701: gradation of created beings, which is nothing more than an inference
16702: from the principle of affinity; for observation and study of the order
16703: of nature could never present it to the mind as an objective truth. The
16704: steps of this ladder, as they appear in experience, are too far apart
16705: from each other, and the so-called petty differences between different
16706: kinds of animals are in nature commonly so wide separations that no
16707: confidence can be placed in such views (particularly when we reflect on
16708: the great variety of things, and the ease with which we can discover
16709: resemblances), and no faith in the laws which are said to express the
16710: aims and purposes of nature. On the other hand, the method of
16711: investigating the order of nature in the light of this principle, and
16712: the maxim which requires us to regard this order—it being still
16713: undetermined how far it extends—as really existing in nature, is beyond
16714: doubt a legitimate and excellent principle of reason—a principle which
16715: extends farther than any experience or observation of ours and which,
16716: without giving us any positive knowledge of anything in the region of
16717: experience, guides us to the goal of systematic unity.
16718: 
16719: _Of the Ultimate End of the Natural Dialectic of Human Reason._
16720: 
16721: The ideas of pure reason cannot be, of themselves and in their own
16722: nature, dialectical; it is from their misemployment alone that
16723: fallacies and illusions arise. For they originate in the nature of
16724: reason itself, and it is impossible that this supreme tribunal for all
16725: the rights and claims of speculation should be itself undeserving of
16726: confidence and promotive of error. It is to be expected, therefore,
16727: that these ideas have a genuine and legitimate aim. It is true, the mob
16728: of sophists raise against reason the cry of inconsistency and
16729: contradiction, and affect to despise the government of that faculty,
16730: because they cannot understand its constitution, while it is to its
16731: beneficial influences alone that they owe the position and the
16732: intelligence which enable them to criticize and to blame its procedure.
16733: 
16734: We cannot employ an à priori conception with certainty, until we have
16735: made a transcendental deduction therefore. The ideas of pure reason do
16736: not admit of the same kind of deduction as the categories. But if they
16737: are to possess the least objective validity, and to represent anything
16738: but mere creations of thought (entia rationis ratiocinantis), a
16739: deduction of them must be possible. This deduction will complete the
16740: critical task imposed upon pure reason; and it is to this part Of our
16741: labours that we now proceed.
16742: 
16743: There is a great difference between a thing’s being presented to the
16744: mind as an object in an absolute sense, or merely as an ideal object.
16745: In the former case I employ my conceptions to determine the object; in
16746: the latter case nothing is present to the mind but a mere schema, which
16747: does not relate directly to an object, not even in a hypothetical
16748: sense, but which is useful only for the purpose of representing other
16749: objects to the mind, in a mediate and indirect manner, by means of
16750: their relation to the idea in the intellect. Thus I say the conception
16751: of a supreme intelligence is a mere idea; that is to say, its objective
16752: reality does not consist in the fact that it has an immediate relation
16753: to an object (for in this sense we have no means of establishing its
16754: objective validity), it is merely a schema constructed according to the
16755: necessary conditions of the unity of reason—the schema of a thing in
16756: general, which is useful towards the production of the highest degree
16757: of systematic unity in the empirical exercise of reason, in which we
16758: deduce this or that object of experience from the imaginary object of
16759: this idea, as the ground or cause of the said object of experience. In
16760: this way, the idea is properly a heuristic, and not an ostensive,
16761: conception; it does not give us any information respecting the
16762: constitution of an object, it merely indicates how, under the guidance
16763: of the idea, we ought to investigate the constitution and the relations
16764: of objects in the world of experience. Now, if it can be shown that the
16765: three kinds of transcendental ideas (psychological, cosmological, and
16766: theological), although not relating directly to any object nor
16767: determining it, do nevertheless, on the supposition of the existence of
16768: an ideal object, produce systematic unity in the laws of the empirical
16769: employment of the reason, and extend our empirical cognition, without
16770: ever being inconsistent or in opposition with it—it must be a necessary
16771: maxim of reason to regulate its procedure according to these ideas. And
16772: this forms the transcendental deduction of all speculative ideas, not
16773: as constitutive principles of the extension of our cognition beyond the
16774: limits of our experience, but as regulative principles of the
16775: systematic unity of empirical cognition, which is by the aid of these
16776: ideas arranged and emended within its own proper limits, to an extent
16777: unattainable by the operation of the principles of the understanding
16778: alone.
16779: 
16780: I shall make this plainer. Guided by the principles involved in these
16781: ideas, we must, in the first place, so connect all the phenomena,
16782: actions, and feelings of the mind, as if it were a simple substance,
16783: which, endowed with personal identity, possesses a permanent existence
16784: (in this life at least), while its states, among which those of the
16785: body are to be included as external conditions, are in continual
16786: change. Secondly, in cosmology, we must investigate the conditions of
16787: all natural phenomena, internal as well as external, as if they
16788: belonged to a chain infinite and without any prime or supreme member,
16789: while we do not, on this account, deny the existence of intelligible
16790: grounds of these phenomena, although we never employ them to explain
16791: phenomena, for the simple reason that they are not objects of our
16792: cognition. Thirdly, in the sphere of theology, we must regard the whole
16793: system of possible experience as forming an absolute, but dependent and
16794: sensuously-conditioned unity, and at the same time as based upon a
16795: sole, supreme, and all-sufficient ground existing apart from the world
16796: itself—a ground which is a self-subsistent, primeval and creative
16797: reason, in relation to which we so employ our reason in the field of
16798: experience, as if all objects drew their origin from that archetype of
16799: all reason. In other words, we ought not to deduce the internal
16800: phenomena of the mind from a simple thinking substance, but deduce them
16801: from each other under the guidance of the regulative idea of a simple
16802: being; we ought not to deduce the phenomena, order, and unity of the
16803: universe from a supreme intelligence, but merely draw from this idea of
16804: a supremely wise cause the rules which must guide reason in its
16805: connection of causes and effects.
16806: 
16807: Now there is nothing to hinder us from admitting these ideas to possess
16808: an objective and hyperbolic existence, except the cosmological ideas,
16809: which lead reason into an antinomy: the psychological and theological
16810: ideas are not antinomial. They contain no contradiction; and how, then,
16811: can any one dispute their objective reality, since he who denies it
16812: knows as little about their possibility as we who affirm? And yet, when
16813: we wish to admit the existence of a thing, it is not sufficient to
16814: convince ourselves that there is no positive obstacle in the way; for
16815: it cannot be allowable to regard mere creations of thought, which
16816: transcend, though they do not contradict, all our conceptions, as real
16817: and determinate objects, solely upon the authority of a speculative
16818: reason striving to compass its own aims. They cannot, therefore, be
16819: admitted to be real in themselves; they can only possess a comparative
16820: reality—that of a schema of the regulative principle of the systematic
16821: unity of all cognition. They are to be regarded not as actual things,
16822: but as in some measure analogous to them. We abstract from the object
16823: of the idea all the conditions which limit the exercise of our
16824: understanding, but which, on the other hand, are the sole conditions of
16825: our possessing a determinate conception of any given thing. And thus we
16826: cogitate a something, of the real nature of which we have not the least
16827: conception, but which we represent to ourselves as standing in a
16828: relation to the whole system of phenomena, analogous to that in which
16829: phenomena stand to each other.
16830: 
16831: By admitting these ideal beings, we do not really extend our cognitions
16832: beyond the objects of possible experience; we extend merely the
16833: empirical unity of our experience, by the aid of systematic unity, the
16834: schema of which is furnished by the idea, which is therefore valid—not
16835: as a constitutive, but as a regulative principle. For although we posit
16836: a thing corresponding to the idea—a something, an actual existence—we
16837: do not on that account aim at the extension of our cognition by means
16838: of transcendent conceptions. This existence is purely ideal, and not
16839: objective; it is the mere expression of the systematic unity which is
16840: to be the guide of reason in the field of experience. There are no
16841: attempts made at deciding what the ground of this unity may be, or what
16842: the real nature of this imaginary being.
16843: 
16844: Thus the transcendental and only determinate conception of God, which
16845: is presented to us by speculative reason, is in the strictest sense
16846: deistic. In other words, reason does not assure us of the objective
16847: validity of the conception; it merely gives us the idea of something,
16848: on which the supreme and necessary unity of all experience is based.
16849: This something we cannot, following the analogy of a real substance,
16850: cogitate otherwise than as the cause of all things operating in
16851: accordance with rational laws, if we regard it as an individual object;
16852: although we should rest contented with the idea alone as a regulative
16853: principle of reason, and make no attempt at completing the sum of the
16854: conditions imposed by thought. This attempt is, indeed, inconsistent
16855: with the grand aim of complete systematic unity in the sphere of
16856: cognition—a unity to which no bounds are set by reason.
16857: 
16858: Hence it happens that, admitting a divine being, I can have no
16859: conception of the internal possibility of its perfection, or of the
16860: necessity of its existence. The only advantage of this admission is
16861: that it enables me to answer all other questions relating to the
16862: contingent, and to give reason the most complete satisfaction as
16863: regards the unity which it aims at attaining in the world of
16864: experience. But I cannot satisfy reason with regard to this hypothesis
16865: itself; and this proves that it is not its intelligence and insight
16866: into the subject, but its speculative interest alone which induces it
16867: to proceed from a point lying far beyond the sphere of our cognition,
16868: for the purpose of being able to consider all objects as parts of a
16869: systematic whole.
16870: 
16871: Here a distinction presents itself, in regard to the way in which we
16872: may cogitate a presupposition—a distinction which is somewhat subtle,
16873: but of great importance in transcendental philosophy. I may have
16874: sufficient grounds to admit something, or the existence of something,
16875: in a relative point of view (suppositio relativa), without being
16876: justified in admitting it in an absolute sense (suppositio absoluta).
16877: This distinction is undoubtedly requisite, in the case of a regulative
16878: principle, the necessity of which we recognize, though we are ignorant
16879: of the source and cause of that necessity, and which we assume to be
16880: based upon some ultimate ground, for the purpose of being able to
16881: cogitate the universality of the principle in a more determinate way.
16882: For example, I cogitate the existence of a being corresponding to a
16883: pure transcendental idea. But I cannot admit that this being exists
16884: absolutely and in itself, because all of the conceptions by which I can
16885: cogitate an object in a determinate manner fall short of assuring me of
16886: its existence; nay, the conditions of the objective validity of my
16887: conceptions are excluded by the idea—by the very fact of its being an
16888: idea. The conceptions of reality, substance, causality, nay, even that
16889: of necessity in existence, have no significance out of the sphere of
16890: empirical cognition, and cannot, beyond that sphere, determine any
16891: object. They may, accordingly, be employed to explain the possibility
16892: of things in the world of sense, but they are utterly inadequate to
16893: explain the possibility of the universe itself considered as a whole;
16894: because in this case the ground of explanation must lie out of and
16895: beyond the world, and cannot, therefore, be an object of possible
16896: experience. Now, I may admit the existence of an incomprehensible being
16897: of this nature—the object of a mere idea, relatively to the world of
16898: sense; although I have no ground to admit its existence absolutely and
16899: in itself. For if an idea (that of a systematic and complete unity, of
16900: which I shall presently speak more particularly) lies at the foundation
16901: of the most extended empirical employment of reason, and if this idea
16902: cannot be adequately represented in concreto, although it is
16903: indispensably necessary for the approximation of empirical unity to the
16904: highest possible degree—I am not only authorized, but compelled, to
16905: realize this idea, that is, to posit a real object corresponding
16906: thereto. But I cannot profess to know this object; it is to me merely a
16907: something, to which, as the ground of systematic unity in cognition, I
16908: attribute such properties as are analogous to the conceptions employed
16909: by the understanding in the sphere of experience. Following the analogy
16910: of the notions of reality, substance, causality, and necessity, I
16911: cogitate a being, which possesses all these attributes in the highest
16912: degree; and, as this idea is the offspring of my reason alone, I
16913: cogitate this being as self-subsistent reason, and as the cause of the
16914: universe operating by means of ideas of the greatest possible harmony
16915: and unity. Thus I abstract all conditions that would limit my idea,
16916: solely for the purpose of rendering systematic unity possible in the
16917: world of empirical diversity, and thus securing the widest possible
16918: extension for the exercise of reason in that sphere. This I am enabled
16919: to do, by regarding all connections and relations in the world of
16920: sense, as if they were the dispositions of a supreme reason, of which
16921: our reason is but a faint image. I then proceed to cogitate this
16922: Supreme Being by conceptions which have, properly, no meaning or
16923: application, except in the world of sense. But as I am authorized to
16924: employ the transcendental hypothesis of such a being in a relative
16925: respect alone, that is, as the substratum of the greatest possible
16926: unity in experience—I may attribute to a being which I regard as
16927: distinct from the world, such properties as belong solely to the sphere
16928: of sense and experience. For I do not desire, and am not justified in
16929: desiring, to cognize this object of my idea, as it exists in itself;
16930: for I possess no conceptions sufficient for this task, those of
16931: reality, substance, causality, nay, even that of necessity in
16932: existence, losing all significance, and becoming merely the signs of
16933: conceptions, without content and without applicability, when I attempt
16934: to carry them beyond the limits of the world of sense. I cogitate
16935: merely the relation of a perfectly unknown being to the greatest
16936: possible systematic unity of experience, solely for the purpose of
16937: employing it as the schema of the regulative principle which directs
16938: reason in its empirical exercise.
16939: 
16940: It is evident, at the first view, that we cannot presuppose the reality
16941: of this transcendental object, by means of the conceptions of reality,
16942: substance, causality, and so on, because these conceptions cannot be
16943: applied to anything that is distinct from the world of sense. Thus the
16944: supposition of a Supreme Being or cause is purely relative; it is
16945: cogitated only in behalf of the systematic unity of experience; such a
16946: being is but a something, of whose existence in itself we have not the
16947: least conception. Thus, too, it becomes sufficiently manifest why we
16948: required the idea of a necessary being in relation to objects given by
16949: sense, although we can never have the least conception of this being,
16950: or of its absolute necessity.
16951: 
16952: And now we can clearly perceive the result of our transcendental
16953: dialectic, and the proper aim of the ideas of pure reason—which become
16954: dialectical solely from misunderstanding and inconsiderateness. Pure
16955: reason is, in fact, occupied with itself, and not with any object.
16956: Objects are not presented to it to be embraced in the unity of an
16957: empirical conception; it is only the cognitions of the understanding
16958: that are presented to it, for the purpose of receiving the unity of a
16959: rational conception, that is, of being connected according to a
16960: principle. The unity of reason is the unity of system; and this
16961: systematic unity is not an objective principle, extending its dominion
16962: over objects, but a subjective maxim, extending its authority over the
16963: empirical cognition of objects. The systematic connection which reason
16964: gives to the empirical employment of the understanding not only
16965: advances the extension of that employment, but ensures its correctness,
16966: and thus the principle of a systematic unity of this nature is also
16967: objective, although only in an indefinite respect (principium vagum).
16968: It is not, however, a constitutive principle, determining an object to
16969: which it directly relates; it is merely a regulative principle or
16970: maxim, advancing and strengthening the empirical exercise of reason, by
16971: the opening up of new paths of which the understanding is ignorant,
16972: while it never conflicts with the laws of its exercise in the sphere of
16973: experience.
16974: 
16975: But reason cannot cogitate this systematic unity, without at the same
16976: time cogitating an object of the idea—an object that cannot be
16977: presented in any experience, which contains no concrete example of a
16978: complete systematic unity. This being (ens rationis ratiocinatae) is
16979: therefore a mere idea and is not assumed to be a thing which is real
16980: absolutely and in itself. On the contrary, it forms merely the
16981: problematical foundation of the connection which the mind introduces
16982: among the phenomena of the sensuous world. We look upon this
16983: connection, in the light of the above-mentioned idea, as if it drew its
16984: origin from the supposed being which corresponds to the idea. And yet
16985: all we aim at is the possession of this idea as a secure foundation for
16986: the systematic unity of experience—a unity indispensable to reason,
16987: advantageous to the understanding, and promotive of the interests of
16988: empirical cognition.
16989: 
16990: We mistake the true meaning of this idea when we regard it as an
16991: enouncement, or even as a hypothetical declaration of the existence of
16992: a real thing, which we are to regard as the origin or ground of a
16993: systematic constitution of the universe. On the contrary, it is left
16994: completely undetermined what the nature or properties of this so-called
16995: ground may be. The idea is merely to be adopted as a point of view,
16996: from which this unity, so essential to reason and so beneficial to the
16997: understanding, may be regarded as radiating. In one word, this
16998: transcendental thing is merely the schema of a regulative principle, by
16999: means of which Reason, so far as in her lies, extends the dominion of
17000: systematic unity over the whole sphere of experience.
17001: 
17002: The first object of an idea of this kind is the ego, considered merely
17003: as a thinking nature or soul. If I wish to investigate the properties
17004: of a thinking being, I must interrogate experience. But I find that I
17005: can apply none of the categories to this object, the schema of these
17006: categories, which is the condition of their application, being given
17007: only in sensuous intuition. But I cannot thus attain to the cognition
17008: of a systematic unity of all the phenomena of the internal sense.
17009: Instead, therefore, of an empirical conception of what the soul really
17010: is, reason takes the conception of the empirical unity of all thought,
17011: and, by cogitating this unity as unconditioned and primitive,
17012: constructs the rational conception or idea of a simple substance which
17013: is in itself unchangeable, possessing personal identity, and in
17014: connection with other real things external to it; in one word, it
17015: constructs the idea of a simple self-subsistent intelligence. But the
17016: real aim of reason in this procedure is the attainment of principles of
17017: systematic unity for the explanation of the phenomena of the soul. That
17018: is, reason desires to be able to represent all the determinations of
17019: the internal sense as existing in one subject, all powers as deduced
17020: from one fundamental power, all changes as mere varieties in the
17021: condition of a being which is permanent and always the same, and all
17022: phenomena in space as entirely different in their nature from the
17023: procedure of thought. Essential simplicity (with the other attributes
17024: predicated of the ego) is regarded as the mere schema of this
17025: regulative principle; it is not assumed that it is the actual ground of
17026: the properties of the soul. For these properties may rest upon quite
17027: different grounds, of which we are completely ignorant; just as the
17028: above predicates could not give us any knowledge of the soul as it is
17029: in itself, even if we regarded them as valid in respect of it, inasmuch
17030: as they constitute a mere idea, which cannot be represented in
17031: concreto. Nothing but good can result from a psychological idea of this
17032: kind, if we only take proper care not to consider it as more than an
17033: idea; that is, if we regard it as valid merely in relation to the
17034: employment of reason, in the sphere of the phenomena of the soul. Under
17035: the guidance of this idea, or principle, no empirical laws of corporeal
17036: phenomena are called in to explain that which is a phenomenon of the
17037: internal sense alone; no windy hypotheses of the generation,
17038: annihilation, and palingenesis of souls are admitted. Thus the
17039: consideration of this object of the internal sense is kept pure, and
17040: unmixed with heterogeneous elements; while the investigation of reason
17041: aims at reducing all the grounds of explanation employed in this sphere
17042: of knowledge to a single principle. All this is best effected, nay,
17043: cannot be effected otherwise than by means of such a schema, which
17044: requires us to regard this ideal thing as an actual existence. The
17045: psychological idea is, therefore, meaningless and inapplicable, except
17046: as the schema of a regulative conception. For, if I ask whether the
17047: soul is not really of a spiritual nature—it is a question which has no
17048: meaning. From such a conception has been abstracted, not merely all
17049: corporeal nature, but all nature, that is, all the predicates of a
17050: possible experience; and consequently, all the conditions which enable
17051: us to cogitate an object to this conception have disappeared. But, if
17052: these conditions are absent, it is evident that the conception is
17053: meaningless.
17054: 
17055: The second regulative idea of speculative reason is the conception of
17056: the universe. For nature is properly the only object presented to us,
17057: in regard to which reason requires regulative principles. Nature is
17058: twofold—thinking and corporeal nature. To cogitate the latter in regard
17059: to its internal possibility, that is, to determine the application of
17060: the categories to it, no idea is required—no representation which
17061: transcends experience. In this sphere, therefore, an idea is
17062: impossible, sensuous intuition being our only guide; while, in the
17063: sphere of psychology, we require the fundamental idea (I), which
17064: contains à priori a certain form of thought namely, the unity of the
17065: ego. Pure reason has, therefore, nothing left but nature in general,
17066: and the completeness of conditions in nature in accordance with some
17067: principle. The absolute totality of the series of these conditions is
17068: an idea, which can never be fully realized in the empirical exercise of
17069: reason, while it is serviceable as a rule for the procedure of reason
17070: in relation to that totality. It requires us, in the explanation of
17071: given phenomena (in the regress or ascent in the series), to proceed as
17072: if the series were infinite in itself, that is, were prolonged in
17073: indefinitum; while on the other hand, where reason is regarded as
17074: itself the determining cause (in the region of freedom), we are
17075: required to proceed as if we had not before us an object of sense, but
17076: of the pure understanding. In this latter case, the conditions do not
17077: exist in the series of phenomena, but may be placed quite out of and
17078: beyond it, and the series of conditions may be regarded as if it had an
17079: absolute beginning from an intelligible cause. All this proves that the
17080: cosmological ideas are nothing but regulative principles, and not
17081: constitutive; and that their aim is not to realize an actual totality
17082: in such series. The full discussion of this subject will be found in
17083: its proper place in the chapter on the antinomy of pure reason.
17084: 
17085: The third idea of pure reason, containing the hypothesis of a being
17086: which is valid merely as a relative hypothesis, is that of the one and
17087: all-sufficient cause of all cosmological series, in other words, the
17088: idea of God. We have not the slightest ground absolutely to admit the
17089: existence of an object corresponding to this idea; for what can empower
17090: or authorize us to affirm the existence of a being of the highest
17091: perfection—a being whose existence is absolutely necessary—merely
17092: because we possess the conception of such a being? The answer is: It is
17093: the existence of the world which renders this hypothesis necessary. But
17094: this answer makes it perfectly evident that the idea of this being,
17095: like all other speculative ideas, is essentially nothing more than a
17096: demand upon reason that it shall regulate the connection which it and
17097: its subordinate faculties introduce into the phenomena of the world by
17098: principles of systematic unity and, consequently, that it shall regard
17099: all phenomena as originating from one all-embracing being, as the
17100: supreme and all-sufficient cause. From this it is plain that the only
17101: aim of reason in this procedure is the establishment of its own formal
17102: rule for the extension of its dominion in the world of experience; that
17103: it does not aim at an extension of its cognition beyond the limits of
17104: experience; and that, consequently, this idea does not contain any
17105: constitutive principle.
17106: 
17107: The highest formal unity, which is based upon ideas alone, is the unity
17108: of all things—a unity in accordance with an aim or purpose; and the
17109: speculative interest of reason renders it necessary to regard all order
17110: in the world as if it originated from the intention and design of a
17111: supreme reason. This principle unfolds to the view of reason in the
17112: sphere of experience new and enlarged prospects, and invites it to
17113: connect the phenomena of the world according to teleological laws, and
17114: in this way to attain to the highest possible degree of systematic
17115: unity. The hypothesis of a supreme intelligence, as the sole cause of
17116: the universe—an intelligence which has for us no more than an ideal
17117: existence—is accordingly always of the greatest service to reason.
17118: Thus, if we presuppose, in relation to the figure of the earth (which
17119: is round, but somewhat flattened at the poles),[71] or that of
17120: mountains or seas, wise designs on the part of an author of the
17121: universe, we cannot fail to make, by the light of this supposition, a
17122: great number of interesting discoveries. If we keep to this hypothesis,
17123: as a principle which is purely regulative, even error cannot be very
17124: detrimental. For, in this case, error can have no more serious
17125: consequences than that, where we expected to discover a teleological
17126: connection (nexus finalis), only a mechanical or physical connection
17127: appears. In such a case, we merely fail to find the additional form of
17128: unity we expected, but we do not lose the rational unity which the mind
17129: requires in its procedure in experience. But even a miscarriage of this
17130: sort cannot affect the law in its general and teleological relations.
17131: For although we may convict an anatomist of an error, when he connects
17132: the limb of some animal with a certain purpose, it is quite impossible
17133: to prove in a single case that any arrangement of nature, be it what it
17134: may, is entirely without aim or design. And thus medical physiology, by
17135: the aid of a principle presented to it by pure reason, extends its very
17136: limited empirical knowledge of the purposes of the different parts of
17137: an organized body so far that it may be asserted with the utmost
17138: confidence, and with the approbation of all reflecting men, that every
17139: organ or bodily part of an animal has its use and answers a certain
17140: design. Now, this is a supposition which, if regarded as of a
17141: constitutive character, goes much farther than any experience or
17142: observation of ours can justify. Hence it is evident that it is nothing
17143: more than a regulative principle of reason, which aims at the highest
17144: degree of systematic unity, by the aid of the idea of a causality
17145: according to design in a supreme cause—a cause which it regards as the
17146: highest intelligence.
17147: 
17148:  [71] The advantages which a circular form, in the case of the earth,
17149:  has over every other, are well known. But few are aware that the
17150:  slight flattening at the poles, which gives it the figure of a
17151:  spheroid, is the only cause which prevents the elevations of
17152:  continents or even of mountains, perhaps thrown up by some internal
17153:  convulsion, from continually altering the position of the axis of the
17154:  earth—and that to some considerable degree in a short time. The great
17155:  protuberance of the earth under the Equator serves to overbalance the
17156:  impetus of all other masses of earth, and thus to preserve the axis of
17157:  the earth, so far as we can observe, in its present position. And yet
17158:  this wise arrangement has been unthinkingly explained from the
17159:  equilibrium of the formerly fluid mass.
17160: 
17161: 
17162: If, however, we neglect this restriction of the idea to a purely
17163: regulative influence, reason is betrayed into numerous errors. For it
17164: has then left the ground of experience, in which alone are to be found
17165: the criteria of truth, and has ventured into the region of the
17166: incomprehensible and unsearchable, on the heights of which it loses its
17167: power and collectedness, because it has completely severed its
17168: connection with experience.
17169: 
17170: The first error which arises from our employing the idea of a Supreme
17171: Being as a constitutive (in repugnance to the very nature of an idea),
17172: and not as a regulative principle, is the error of inactive reason
17173: (ignava ratio).[72] We may so term every principle which requires us to
17174: regard our investigations of nature as absolutely complete, and allows
17175: reason to cease its inquiries, as if it had fully executed its task.
17176: Thus the psychological idea of the ego, when employed as a constitutive
17177: principle for the explanation of the phenomena of the soul, and for the
17178: extension of our knowledge regarding this subject beyond the limits of
17179: experience—even to the condition of the soul after death—is convenient
17180: enough for the purposes of pure reason, but detrimental and even
17181: ruinous to its interests in the sphere of nature and experience. The
17182: dogmatizing spiritualist explains the unchanging unity of our
17183: personality through all changes of condition from the unity of a
17184: thinking substance, the interest which we take in things and events
17185: that can happen only after our death, from a consciousness of the
17186: immaterial nature of our thinking subject, and so on. Thus he dispenses
17187: with all empirical investigations into the cause of these internal
17188: phenomena, and with all possible explanations of them upon purely
17189: natural grounds; while, at the dictation of a transcendent reason, he
17190: passes by the immanent sources of cognition in experience, greatly to
17191: his own ease and convenience, but to the sacrifice of all, genuine
17192: insight and intelligence. These prejudicial consequences become still
17193: more evident, in the case of the dogmatical treatment of our idea of a
17194: Supreme Intelligence, and the theological system of nature
17195: (physico-theology) which is falsely based upon it. For, in this case,
17196: the aims which we observe in nature, and often those which we merely
17197: fancy to exist, make the investigation of causes a very easy task, by
17198: directing us to refer such and such phenomena immediately to the
17199: unsearchable will and counsel of the Supreme Wisdom, while we ought to
17200: investigate their causes in the general laws of the mechanism of
17201: matter. We are thus recommended to consider the labour of reason as
17202: ended, when we have merely dispensed with its employment, which is
17203: guided surely and safely only by the order of nature and the series of
17204: changes in the world—which are arranged according to immanent and
17205: general laws. This error may be avoided, if we do not merely consider
17206: from the view-point of final aims certain parts of nature, such as the
17207: division and structure of a continent, the constitution and direction
17208: of certain mountain-chains, or even the organization existing in the
17209: vegetable and animal kingdoms, but look upon this systematic unity of
17210: nature in a perfectly general way, in relation to the idea of a Supreme
17211: Intelligence. If we pursue this advice, we lay as a foundation for all
17212: investigation the conformity to aims of all phenomena of nature in
17213: accordance with universal laws, for which no particular arrangement of
17214: nature is exempt, but only cognized by us with more or less difficulty;
17215: and we possess a regulative principle of the systematic unity of a
17216: teleological connection, which we do not attempt to anticipate or
17217: predetermine. All that we do, and ought to do, is to follow out the
17218: physico-mechanical connection in nature according to general laws, with
17219: the hope of discovering, sooner or later, the teleological connection
17220: also. Thus, and thus only, can the principle of final unity aid in the
17221: extension of the employment of reason in the sphere of experience,
17222: without being in any case detrimental to its interests.
17223: 
17224:  [72] This was the term applied by the old dialecticians to a
17225:  sophistical argument, which ran thus: If it is your fate to die of
17226:  this disease, you will die, whether you employ a physician or not.
17227:  Cicero says that this mode of reasoning has received this appellation,
17228:  because, if followed, it puts an end to the employment of reason in
17229:  the affairs of life. For a similar reason, I have applied this
17230:  designation to the sophistical argument of pure reason.
17231: 
17232: 
17233: The second error which arises from the misconception of the principle
17234: of systematic unity is that of perverted reason (perversa ratio,
17235: usteron roteron rationis). The idea of systematic unity is available as
17236: a regulative principle in the connection of phenomena according to
17237: general natural laws; and, how far soever we have to travel upon the
17238: path of experience to discover some fact or event, this idea requires
17239: us to believe that we have approached all the more nearly to the
17240: completion of its use in the sphere of nature, although that completion
17241: can never be attained. But this error reverses the procedure of reason.
17242: We begin by hypostatizing the principle of systematic unity, and by
17243: giving an anthropomorphic determination to the conception of a Supreme
17244: Intelligence, and then proceed forcibly to impose aims upon nature.
17245: Thus not only does teleology, which ought to aid in the completion of
17246: unity in accordance with general laws, operate to the destruction of
17247: its influence, but it hinders reason from attaining its proper aim,
17248: that is, the proof, upon natural grounds, of the existence of a supreme
17249: intelligent cause. For, if we cannot presuppose supreme finality in
17250: nature à priori, that is, as essentially belonging to nature, how can
17251: we be directed to endeavour to discover this unity and, rising
17252: gradually through its different degrees, to approach the supreme
17253: perfection of an author of all—a perfection which is absolutely
17254: necessary, and therefore cognizable à priori? The regulative principle
17255: directs us to presuppose systematic unity absolutely and, consequently,
17256: as following from the essential nature of things—but only as a unity of
17257: nature, not merely cognized empirically, but presupposed à priori,
17258: although only in an indeterminate manner. But if I insist on basing
17259: nature upon the foundation of a supreme ordaining Being, the unity of
17260: nature is in effect lost. For, in this case, it is quite foreign and
17261: unessential to the nature of things, and cannot be cognized from the
17262: general laws of nature. And thus arises a vicious circular argument,
17263: what ought to have been proved having been presupposed.
17264: 
17265: To take the regulative principle of systematic unity in nature for a
17266: constitutive principle, and to hypostatize and make a cause out of that
17267: which is properly the ideal ground of the consistent and harmonious
17268: exercise of reason, involves reason in inextricable embarrassments. The
17269: investigation of nature pursues its own path under the guidance of the
17270: chain of natural causes, in accordance with the general laws of nature,
17271: and ever follows the light of the idea of an author of the universe—not
17272: for the purpose of deducing the finality, which it constantly pursues,
17273: from this Supreme Being, but to attain to the cognition of his
17274: existence from the finality which it seeks in the existence of the
17275: phenomena of nature, and, if possible, in that of all things to cognize
17276: this being, consequently, as absolutely necessary. Whether this latter
17277: purpose succeed or not, the idea is and must always be a true one, and
17278: its employment, when merely regulative, must always be accompanied by
17279: truthful and beneficial results.
17280: 
17281: Complete unity, in conformity with aims, constitutes absolute
17282: perfection. But if we do not find this unity in the nature of the
17283: things which go to constitute the world of experience, that is, of
17284: objective cognition, consequently in the universal and necessary laws
17285: of nature, how can we infer from this unity the idea of the supreme and
17286: absolutely necessary perfection of a primal being, which is the origin
17287: of all causality? The greatest systematic unity, and consequently
17288: teleological unity, constitutes the very foundation of the possibility
17289: of the most extended employment of human reason. The idea of unity is
17290: therefore essentially and indissolubly connected with the nature of our
17291: reason. This idea is a legislative one; and hence it is very natural
17292: that we should assume the existence of a legislative reason
17293: corresponding to it, from which the systematic unity of nature—the
17294: object of the operations of reason—must be derived.
17295: 
17296: In the course of our discussion of the antinomies, we stated that it is
17297: always possible to answer all the questions which pure reason may
17298: raise; and that the plea of the limited nature of our cognition, which
17299: is unavoidable and proper in many questions regarding natural
17300: phenomena, cannot in this case be admitted, because the questions
17301: raised do not relate to the nature of things, but are necessarily
17302: originated by the nature of reason itself, and relate to its own
17303: internal constitution. We can now establish this assertion, which at
17304: first sight appeared so rash, in relation to the two questions in which
17305: reason takes the greatest interest, and thus complete our discussion of
17306: the dialectic of pure reason.
17307: 
17308: If, then, the question is asked, in relation to transcendental
17309: theology,[73] first, whether there is anything distinct from the world,
17310: which contains the ground of cosmical order and connection according to
17311: general laws? The answer is: Certainly. For the world is a sum of
17312: phenomena; there must, therefore, be some transcendental basis of these
17313: phenomena, that is, a basis cogitable by the pure understanding alone.
17314: If, secondly, the question is asked whether this being is substance,
17315: whether it is of the greatest reality, whether it is necessary, and so
17316: forth? I answer that this question is utterly without meaning. For all
17317: the categories which aid me in forming a conception of an object cannot
17318: be employed except in the world of sense, and are without meaning when
17319: not applied to objects of actual or possible experience. Out of this
17320: sphere, they are not properly conceptions, but the mere marks or
17321: indices of conceptions, which we may admit, although they cannot,
17322: without the help of experience, help us to understand any subject or
17323: thing. If, thirdly, the question is whether we may not cogitate this
17324: being, which is distinct from the world, in analogy with the objects of
17325: experience? The answer is: Undoubtedly, but only as an ideal, and not
17326: as a real object. That is, we must cogitate it only as an unknown
17327: substratum of the systematic unity, order, and finality of the world—a
17328: unity which reason must employ as the regulative principle of its
17329: investigation of nature. Nay, more, we may admit into the idea certain
17330: anthropomorphic elements, which are promotive of the interests of this
17331: regulative principle. For it is no more than an idea, which does not
17332: relate directly to a being distinct from the world, but to the
17333: regulative principle of the systematic unity of the world, by means,
17334: however, of a schema of this unity—the schema of a Supreme
17335: Intelligence, who is the wisely-designing author of the universe. What
17336: this basis of cosmical unity may be in itself, we know not—we cannot
17337: discover from the idea; we merely know how we ought to employ the idea
17338: of this unity, in relation to the systematic operation of reason in the
17339: sphere of experience.
17340: 
17341:  [73] After what has been said of the psychological idea of the ego and
17342:  its proper employment as a regulative principle of the operations of
17343:  reason, I need not enter into details regarding the transcendental
17344:  illusion by which the systematic unity of all the various phenomena of
17345:  the internal sense is hypostatized. The procedure is in this case very
17346:  similar to that which has been discussed in our remarks on the
17347:  theological ideal.
17348: 
17349: 
17350: But, it will be asked again, can we on these grounds, admit the
17351: existence of a wise and omnipotent author of the world? Without doubt;
17352: and not only so, but we must assume the existence of such a being. But
17353: do we thus extend the limits of our knowledge beyond the field of
17354: possible experience? By no means. For we have merely presupposed a
17355: something, of which we have no conception, which we do not know as it
17356: is in itself; but, in relation to the systematic disposition of the
17357: universe, which we must presuppose in all our observation of nature, we
17358: have cogitated this unknown being in analogy with an intelligent
17359: existence (an empirical conception), that is to say, we have endowed it
17360: with those attributes, which, judging from the nature of our own
17361: reason, may contain the ground of such a systematic unity. This idea is
17362: therefore valid only relatively to the employment in experience of our
17363: reason. But if we attribute to it absolute and objective validity, we
17364: overlook the fact that it is merely an ideal being that we cogitate;
17365: and, by setting out from a basis which is not determinable by
17366: considerations drawn from experience, we place ourselves in a position
17367: which incapacitates us from applying this principle to the empirical
17368: employment of reason.
17369: 
17370: But, it will be asked further, can I make any use of this conception
17371: and hypothesis in my investigations into the world and nature? Yes, for
17372: this very purpose was the idea established by reason as a fundamental
17373: basis. But may I regard certain arrangements, which seemed to have been
17374: made in conformity with some fixed aim, as the arrangements of design,
17375: and look upon them as proceeding from the divine will, with the
17376: intervention, however, of certain other particular arrangements
17377: disposed to that end? Yes, you may do so; but at the same time you must
17378: regard it as indifferent, whether it is asserted that divine wisdom has
17379: disposed all things in conformity with his highest aims, or that the
17380: idea of supreme wisdom is a regulative principle in the investigation
17381: of nature, and at the same time a principle of the systematic unity of
17382: nature according to general laws, even in those cases where we are
17383: unable to discover that unity. In other words, it must be perfectly
17384: indifferent to you whether you say, when you have discovered this
17385: unity: God has wisely willed it so; or: Nature has wisely arranged
17386: this. For it was nothing but the systematic unity, which reason
17387: requires as a basis for the investigation of nature, that justified you
17388: in accepting the idea of a supreme intelligence as a schema for a
17389: regulative principle; and, the farther you advance in the discovery of
17390: design and finality, the more certain the validity of your idea. But,
17391: as the whole aim of this regulative principle was the discovery of a
17392: necessary and systematic unity in nature, we have, in so far as we
17393: attain this, to attribute our success to the idea of a Supreme Being;
17394: while, at the same time, we cannot, without involving ourselves in
17395: contradictions, overlook the general laws of nature, as it was in
17396: reference to them alone that this idea was employed. We cannot, I say,
17397: overlook the general laws of nature, and regard this conformity to aims
17398: observable in nature as contingent or hyperphysical in its origin;
17399: inasmuch as there is no ground which can justify us in the admission of
17400: a being with such properties distinct from and above nature. All that
17401: we are authorized to assert is that this idea may be employed as a
17402: principle, and that the properties of the being which is assumed to
17403: correspond to it may be regarded as systematically connected in analogy
17404: with the causal determination of phenomena.
17405: 
17406: For the same reasons we are justified in introducing into the idea of
17407: the supreme cause other anthropomorphic elements (for without these we
17408: could not predicate anything of it); we may regard it as allowable to
17409: cogitate this cause as a being with understanding, the feelings of
17410: pleasure and displeasure, and faculties of desire and will
17411: corresponding to these. At the same time, we may attribute to this
17412: being infinite perfection—a perfection which necessarily transcends
17413: that which our knowledge of the order and design in the world authorize
17414: us to predicate of it. For the regulative law of systematic unity
17415: requires us to study nature on the supposition that systematic and
17416: final unity in infinitum is everywhere discoverable, even in the
17417: highest diversity. For, although we may discover little of this
17418: cosmical perfection, it belongs to the legislative prerogative of
17419: reason to require us always to seek for and to expect it; while it must
17420: always be beneficial to institute all inquiries into nature in
17421: accordance with this principle. But it is evident that, by this idea of
17422: a supreme author of all, which I place as the foundation of all
17423: inquiries into nature, I do not mean to assert the existence of such a
17424: being, or that I have any knowledge of its existence; and,
17425: consequently, I do not really deduce anything from the existence of
17426: this being, but merely from its idea, that is to say, from the nature
17427: of things in this world, in accordance with this idea. A certain dim
17428: consciousness of the true use of this idea seems to have dictated to
17429: the philosophers of all times the moderate language used by them
17430: regarding the cause of the world. We find them employing the
17431: expressions wisdom and care of nature, and divine wisdom, as
17432: synonymous—nay, in purely speculative discussions, preferring the
17433: former, because it does not carry the appearance of greater pretensions
17434: than such as we are entitled to make, and at the same time directs
17435: reason to its proper field of action—nature and her phenomena.
17436: 
17437: Thus, pure reason, which at first seemed to promise us nothing less
17438: than the extension of our cognition beyond the limits of experience, is
17439: found, when thoroughly examined, to contain nothing but regulative
17440: principles, the virtue and function of which is to introduce into our
17441: cognition a higher degree of unity than the understanding could of
17442: itself. These principles, by placing the goal of all our struggles at
17443: so great a distance, realize for us the most thorough connection
17444: between the different parts of our cognition, and the highest degree of
17445: systematic unity. But, on the other hand, if misunderstood and employed
17446: as constitutive principles of transcendent cognition, they become the
17447: parents of illusions and contradictions, while pretending to introduce
17448: us to new regions of knowledge.
17449: 
17450: Thus all human cognition begins with intuitions, proceeds from thence
17451: to conceptions, and ends with ideas. Although it possesses, in relation
17452: to all three elements, à priori sources of cognition, which seemed to
17453: transcend the limits of all experience, a thoroughgoing criticism
17454: demonstrates that speculative reason can never, by the aid of these
17455: elements, pass the bounds of possible experience, and that the proper
17456: destination of this highest faculty of cognition is to employ all
17457: methods, and all the principles of these methods, for the purpose of
17458: penetrating into the innermost secrets of nature, by the aid of the
17459: principles of unity (among all kinds of which teleological unity is the
17460: highest), while it ought not to attempt to soar above the sphere of
17461: experience, beyond which there lies nought for us but the void inane.
17462: The critical examination, in our Transcendental Analytic, of all the
17463: propositions which professed to extend cognition beyond the sphere of
17464: experience, completely demonstrated that they can only conduct us to a
17465: possible experience. If we were not distrustful even of the clearest
17466: abstract theorems, if we were not allured by specious and inviting
17467: prospects to escape from the constraining power of their evidence, we
17468: might spare ourselves the laborious examination of all the dialectical
17469: arguments which a transcendent reason adduces in support of its
17470: pretensions; for we should know with the most complete certainty that,
17471: however honest such professions might be, they are null and valueless,
17472: because they relate to a kind of knowledge to which no man can by any
17473: possibility attain. But, as there is no end to discussion, if we cannot
17474: discover the true cause of the illusions by which even the wisest are
17475: deceived, and as the analysis of all our transcendent cognition into
17476: its elements is of itself of no slight value as a psychological study,
17477: while it is a duty incumbent on every philosopher—it was found
17478: necessary to investigate the dialectical procedure of reason in its
17479: primary sources. And as the inferences of which this dialectic is the
17480: parent are not only deceitful, but naturally possess a profound
17481: interest for humanity, it was advisable at the same time, to give a
17482: full account of the momenta of this dialectical procedure, and to
17483: deposit it in the archives of human reason, as a warning to all future
17484: metaphysicians to avoid these causes of speculative error.
17485: 
17486: 
17487: 
17488: II. Transcendental Doctrine of Method
17489: 
17490: 
17491: If we regard the sum of the cognition of pure speculative reason as an
17492: edifice, the idea of which, at least, exists in the human mind, it may
17493: be said that we have in the Transcendental Doctrine of Elements
17494: examined the materials and determined to what edifice these belong, and
17495: what its height and stability. We have found, indeed, that, although we
17496: had purposed to build for ourselves a tower which should reach to
17497: Heaven, the supply of materials sufficed merely for a habitation, which
17498: was spacious enough for all terrestrial purposes, and high enough to
17499: enable us to survey the level plain of experience, but that the bold
17500: undertaking designed necessarily failed for want of materials—not to
17501: mention the confusion of tongues, which gave rise to endless disputes
17502: among the labourers on the plan of the edifice, and at last scattered
17503: them over all the world, each to erect a separate building for himself,
17504: according to his own plans and his own inclinations. Our present task
17505: relates not to the materials, but to the plan of an edifice; and, as we
17506: have had sufficient warning not to venture blindly upon a design which
17507: may be found to transcend our natural powers, while, at the same time,
17508: we cannot give up the intention of erecting a secure abode for the
17509: mind, we must proportion our design to the material which is presented
17510: to us, and which is, at the same time, sufficient for all our wants.
17511: 
17512: I understand, then, by the transcendental doctrine of method, the
17513: determination of the formal conditions of a complete system of pure
17514: reason. We shall accordingly have to treat of the discipline, the
17515: canon, the architectonic, and, finally, the history of pure reason.
17516: This part of our Critique will accomplish, from the transcendental
17517: point of view, what has been usually attempted, but miserably executed,
17518: under the name of practical logic. It has been badly executed, I say,
17519: because general logic, not being limited to any particular kind of
17520: cognition (not even to the pure cognition of the understanding) nor to
17521: any particular objects, it cannot, without borrowing from other
17522: sciences, do more than present merely the titles or signs of possible
17523: methods and the technical expressions, which are employed in the
17524: systematic parts of all sciences; and thus the pupil is made acquainted
17525: with names, the meaning and application of which he is to learn only at
17526: some future time.
17527: 
17528: Chapter I. The Discipline of Pure Reason
17529: 
17530: Negative judgements—those which are so not merely as regards their
17531: logical form, but in respect of their content—are not commonly held in
17532: especial respect. They are, on the contrary, regarded as jealous
17533: enemies of our insatiable desire for knowledge; and it almost requires
17534: an apology to induce us to tolerate, much less to prize and to respect
17535: them.
17536: 
17537: All propositions, indeed, may be logically expressed in a negative
17538: form; but, in relation to the content of our cognition, the peculiar
17539: province of negative judgements is solely to prevent error. For this
17540: reason, too, negative propositions, which are framed for the purpose of
17541: correcting false cognitions where error is absolutely impossible, are
17542: undoubtedly true, but inane and senseless; that is, they are in reality
17543: purposeless and, for this reason, often very ridiculous. Such is the
17544: proposition of the schoolman that Alexander could not have subdued any
17545: countries without an army.
17546: 
17547: But where the limits of our possible cognition are very much
17548: contracted, the attraction to new fields of knowledge great, the
17549: illusions to which the mind is subject of the most deceptive character,
17550: and the evil consequences of error of no inconsiderable magnitude—the
17551: negative element in knowledge, which is useful only to guard us against
17552: error, is of far more importance than much of that positive instruction
17553: which makes additions to the sum of our knowledge. The restraint which
17554: is employed to repress, and finally to extirpate the constant
17555: inclination to depart from certain rules, is termed discipline. It is
17556: distinguished from culture, which aims at the formation of a certain
17557: degree of skill, without attempting to repress or to destroy any other
17558: mental power, already existing. In the cultivation of a talent, which
17559: has given evidence of an impulse towards self-development, discipline
17560: takes a negative,[74] culture and doctrine a positive, part.
17561: 
17562:  [74] I am well aware that, in the language of the schools, the term
17563:  discipline is usually employed as synonymous with instruction. But
17564:  there are so many cases in which it is necessary to distinguish the
17565:  notion of the former, as a course of corrective training, from that of
17566:  the latter, as the communication of knowledge, and the nature of
17567:  things itself demands the appropriation of the most suitable
17568:  expressions for this distinction, that it is my desire that the former
17569:  terms should never be employed in any other than a negative
17570:  signification.
17571: 
17572: 
17573: That natural dispositions and talents (such as imagination and wit),
17574: which ask a free and unlimited development, require in many respects
17575: the corrective influence of discipline, every one will readily grant.
17576: But it may well appear strange that reason, whose proper duty it is to
17577: prescribe rules of discipline to all the other powers of the mind,
17578: should itself require this corrective. It has, in fact, hitherto
17579: escaped this humiliation, only because, in presence of its magnificent
17580: pretensions and high position, no one could readily suspect it to be
17581: capable of substituting fancies for conceptions, and words for things.
17582: 
17583: Reason, when employed in the field of experience, does not stand in
17584: need of criticism, because its principles are subjected to the
17585: continual test of empirical observations. Nor is criticism requisite in
17586: the sphere of mathematics, where the conceptions of reason must always
17587: be presented in concreto in pure intuition, and baseless or arbitrary
17588: assertions are discovered without difficulty. But where reason is not
17589: held in a plain track by the influence of empirical or of pure
17590: intuition, that is, when it is employed in the transcendental sphere of
17591: pure conceptions, it stands in great need of discipline, to restrain
17592: its propensity to overstep the limits of possible experience and to
17593: keep it from wandering into error. In fact, the utility of the
17594: philosophy of pure reason is entirely of this negative character.
17595: Particular errors may be corrected by particular animadversions, and
17596: the causes of these errors may be eradicated by criticism. But where we
17597: find, as in the case of pure reason, a complete system of illusions and
17598: fallacies, closely connected with each other and depending upon grand
17599: general principles, there seems to be required a peculiar and negative
17600: code of mental legislation, which, under the denomination of a
17601: discipline, and founded upon the nature of reason and the objects of
17602: its exercise, shall constitute a system of thorough examination and
17603: testing, which no fallacy will be able to withstand or escape from,
17604: under whatever disguise or concealment it may lurk.
17605: 
17606: But the reader must remark that, in this the second division of our
17607: transcendental Critique the discipline of pure reason is not directed
17608: to the content, but to the method of the cognition of pure reason. The
17609: former task has been completed in the doctrine of elements. But there
17610: is so much similarity in the mode of employing the faculty of reason,
17611: whatever be the object to which it is applied, while, at the same time,
17612: its employment in the transcendental sphere is so essentially different
17613: in kind from every other, that, without the warning negative influence
17614: of a discipline specially directed to that end, the errors are
17615: unavoidable which spring from the unskillful employment of the methods
17616: which are originated by reason but which are out of place in this
17617: sphere.
17618: 
17619: Section I. The Discipline of Pure Reason in the Sphere of Dogmatism
17620: 
17621: The science of mathematics presents the most brilliant example of the
17622: extension of the sphere of pure reason without the aid of experience.
17623: Examples are always contagious; and they exert an especial influence on
17624: the same faculty, which naturally flatters itself that it will have the
17625: same good fortune in other case as fell to its lot in one fortunate
17626: instance. Hence pure reason hopes to be able to extend its empire in
17627: the transcendental sphere with equal success and security, especially
17628: when it applies the same method which was attended with such brilliant
17629: results in the science of mathematics. It is, therefore, of the highest
17630: importance for us to know whether the method of arriving at
17631: demonstrative certainty, which is termed mathematical, be identical
17632: with that by which we endeavour to attain the same degree of certainty
17633: in philosophy, and which is termed in that science dogmatical.
17634: 
17635: Philosophical cognition is the cognition of reason by means of
17636: conceptions; mathematical cognition is cognition by means of the
17637: construction of conceptions. The construction of a conception is the
17638: presentation à priori of the intuition which corresponds to the
17639: conception. For this purpose a non-empirical intuition is requisite,
17640: which, as an intuition, is an individual object; while, as the
17641: construction of a conception (a general representation), it must be
17642: seen to be universally valid for all the possible intuitions which rank
17643: under that conception. Thus I construct a triangle, by the presentation
17644: of the object which corresponds to this conception, either by mere
17645: imagination, in pure intuition, or upon paper, in empirical intuition,
17646: in both cases completely à priori, without borrowing the type of that
17647: figure from any experience. The individual figure drawn upon paper is
17648: empirical; but it serves, notwithstanding, to indicate the conception,
17649: even in its universality, because in this empirical intuition we keep
17650: our eye merely on the act of the construction of the conception, and
17651: pay no attention to the various modes of determining it, for example,
17652: its size, the length of its sides, the size of its angles, these not in
17653: the least affecting the essential character of the conception.
17654: 
17655: Philosophical cognition, accordingly, regards the particular only in
17656: the general; mathematical the general in the particular, nay, in the
17657: individual. This is done, however, entirely à priori and by means of
17658: pure reason, so that, as this individual figure is determined under
17659: certain universal conditions of construction, the object of the
17660: conception, to which this individual figure corresponds as its schema,
17661: must be cogitated as universally determined.
17662: 
17663: The essential difference of these two modes of cognition consists,
17664: therefore, in this formal quality; it does not regard the difference of
17665: the matter or objects of both. Those thinkers who aim at distinguishing
17666: philosophy from mathematics by asserting that the former has to do with
17667: quality merely, and the latter with quantity, have mistaken the effect
17668: for the cause. The reason why mathematical cognition can relate only to
17669: quantity is to be found in its form alone. For it is the conception of
17670: quantities only that is capable of being constructed, that is,
17671: presented à priori in intuition; while qualities cannot be given in any
17672: other than an empirical intuition. Hence the cognition of qualities by
17673: reason is possible only through conceptions. No one can find an
17674: intuition which shall correspond to the conception of reality, except
17675: in experience; it cannot be presented to the mind à priori and
17676: antecedently to the empirical consciousness of a reality. We can form
17677: an intuition, by means of the mere conception of it, of a cone, without
17678: the aid of experience; but the colour of the cone we cannot know except
17679: from experience. I cannot present an intuition of a cause, except in an
17680: example which experience offers to me. Besides, philosophy, as well as
17681: mathematics, treats of quantities; as, for example, of totality,
17682: infinity, and so on. Mathematics, too, treats of the difference of
17683: lines and surfaces—as spaces of different quality, of the continuity of
17684: extension—as a quality thereof. But, although in such cases they have a
17685: common object, the mode in which reason considers that object is very
17686: different in philosophy from what it is in mathematics. The former
17687: confines itself to the general conceptions; the latter can do nothing
17688: with a mere conception, it hastens to intuition. In this intuition it
17689: regards the conception in concreto, not empirically, but in an à priori
17690: intuition, which it has constructed; and in which, all the results
17691: which follow from the general conditions of the construction of the
17692: conception are in all cases valid for the object of the constructed
17693: conception.
17694: 
17695: Suppose that the conception of a triangle is given to a philosopher and
17696: that he is required to discover, by the philosophical method, what
17697: relation the sum of its angles bears to a right angle. He has nothing
17698: before him but the conception of a figure enclosed within three right
17699: lines, and, consequently, with the same number of angles. He may
17700: analyse the conception of a right line, of an angle, or of the number
17701: three as long as he pleases, but he will not discover any properties
17702: not contained in these conceptions. But, if this question is proposed
17703: to a geometrician, he at once begins by constructing a triangle. He
17704: knows that two right angles are equal to the sum of all the contiguous
17705: angles which proceed from one point in a straight line; and he goes on
17706: to produce one side of his triangle, thus forming two adjacent angles
17707: which are together equal to two right angles. He then divides the
17708: exterior of these angles, by drawing a line parallel with the opposite
17709: side of the triangle, and immediately perceives that he has thus got an
17710: exterior adjacent angle which is equal to the interior. Proceeding in
17711: this way, through a chain of inferences, and always on the ground of
17712: intuition, he arrives at a clear and universally valid solution of the
17713: question.
17714: 
17715: But mathematics does not confine itself to the construction of
17716: quantities (quanta), as in the case of geometry; it occupies itself
17717: with pure quantity also (quantitas), as in the case of algebra, where
17718: complete abstraction is made of the properties of the object indicated
17719: by the conception of quantity. In algebra, a certain method of notation
17720: by signs is adopted, and these indicate the different possible
17721: constructions of quantities, the extraction of roots, and so on. After
17722: having thus denoted the general conception of quantities, according to
17723: their different relations, the different operations by which quantity
17724: or number is increased or diminished are presented in intuition in
17725: accordance with general rules. Thus, when one quantity is to be divided
17726: by another, the signs which denote both are placed in the form peculiar
17727: to the operation of division; and thus algebra, by means of a
17728: symbolical construction of quantity, just as geometry, with its
17729: ostensive or geometrical construction (a construction of the objects
17730: themselves), arrives at results which discursive cognition cannot hope
17731: to reach by the aid of mere conceptions.
17732: 
17733: Now, what is the cause of this difference in the fortune of the
17734: philosopher and the mathematician, the former of whom follows the path
17735: of conceptions, while the latter pursues that of intuitions, which he
17736: represents, à priori, in correspondence with his conceptions? The cause
17737: is evident from what has been already demonstrated in the introduction
17738: to this Critique. We do not, in the present case, want to discover
17739: analytical propositions, which may be produced merely by analysing our
17740: conceptions—for in this the philosopher would have the advantage over
17741: his rival; we aim at the discovery of synthetical propositions—such
17742: synthetical propositions, moreover, as can be cognized à priori. I must
17743: not confine myself to that which I actually cogitate in my conception
17744: of a triangle, for this is nothing more than the mere definition; I
17745: must try to go beyond that, and to arrive at properties which are not
17746: contained in, although they belong to, the conception. Now, this is
17747: impossible, unless I determine the object present to my mind according
17748: to the conditions, either of empirical, or of pure, intuition. In the
17749: former case, I should have an empirical proposition (arrived at by
17750: actual measurement of the angles of the triangle), which would possess
17751: neither universality nor necessity; but that would be of no value. In
17752: the latter, I proceed by geometrical construction, by means of which I
17753: collect, in a pure intuition, just as I would in an empirical
17754: intuition, all the various properties which belong to the schema of a
17755: triangle in general, and consequently to its conception, and thus
17756: construct synthetical propositions which possess the attribute of
17757: universality.
17758: 
17759: It would be vain to philosophize upon the triangle, that is, to reflect
17760: on it discursively; I should get no further than the definition with
17761: which I had been obliged to set out. There are certainly transcendental
17762: synthetical propositions which are framed by means of pure conceptions,
17763: and which form the peculiar distinction of philosophy; but these do not
17764: relate to any particular thing, but to a thing in general, and enounce
17765: the conditions under which the perception of it may become a part of
17766: possible experience. But the science of mathematics has nothing to do
17767: with such questions, nor with the question of existence in any fashion;
17768: it is concerned merely with the properties of objects in themselves,
17769: only in so far as these are connected with the conception of the
17770: objects.
17771: 
17772: In the above example, we merely attempted to show the great difference
17773: which exists between the discursive employment of reason in the sphere
17774: of conceptions, and its intuitive exercise by means of the construction
17775: of conceptions. The question naturally arises: What is the cause which
17776: necessitates this twofold exercise of reason, and how are we to
17777: discover whether it is the philosophical or the mathematical method
17778: which reason is pursuing in an argument?
17779: 
17780: All our knowledge relates, finally, to possible intuitions, for it is
17781: these alone that present objects to the mind. An à priori or
17782: non-empirical conception contains either a pure intuition—and in this
17783: case it can be constructed; or it contains nothing but the synthesis of
17784: possible intuitions, which are not given à priori. In this latter case,
17785: it may help us to form synthetical à priori judgements, but only in the
17786: discursive method, by conceptions, not in the intuitive, by means of
17787: the construction of conceptions.
17788: 
17789: The only à priori intuition is that of the pure form of phenomena—space
17790: and time. A conception of space and time as quanta may be presented à
17791: priori in intuition, that is, constructed, either alone with their
17792: quality (figure), or as pure quantity (the mere synthesis of the
17793: homogeneous), by means of number. But the matter of phenomena, by which
17794: things are given in space and time, can be presented only in
17795: perception, à posteriori. The only conception which represents à priori
17796: this empirical content of phenomena is the conception of a thing in
17797: general; and the à priori synthetical cognition of this conception can
17798: give us nothing more than the rule for the synthesis of that which may
17799: be contained in the corresponding à posteriori perception; it is
17800: utterly inadequate to present an à priori intuition of the real object,
17801: which must necessarily be empirical.
17802: 
17803: Synthetical propositions, which relate to things in general, an à
17804: priori intuition of which is impossible, are transcendental. For this
17805: reason transcendental propositions cannot be framed by means of the
17806: construction of conceptions; they are à priori, and based entirely on
17807: conceptions themselves. They contain merely the rule, by which we are
17808: to seek in the world of perception or experience the synthetical unity
17809: of that which cannot be intuited à priori. But they are incompetent to
17810: present any of the conceptions which appear in them in an à priori
17811: intuition; these can be given only à posteriori, in experience, which,
17812: however, is itself possible only through these synthetical principles.
17813: 
17814: If we are to form a synthetical judgement regarding a conception, we
17815: must go beyond it, to the intuition in which it is given. If we keep to
17816: what is contained in the conception, the judgement is merely
17817: analytical—it is merely an explanation of what we have cogitated in the
17818: conception. But I can pass from the conception to the pure or empirical
17819: intuition which corresponds to it. I can proceed to examine my
17820: conception in concreto, and to cognize, either à priori or a posterio,
17821: what I find in the object of the conception. The former—à priori
17822: cognition—is rational-mathematical cognition by means of the
17823: construction of the conception; the latter—à posteriori cognition—is
17824: purely empirical cognition, which does not possess the attributes of
17825: necessity and universality. Thus I may analyse the conception I have of
17826: gold; but I gain no new information from this analysis, I merely
17827: enumerate the different properties which I had connected with the
17828: notion indicated by the word. My knowledge has gained in logical
17829: clearness and arrangement, but no addition has been made to it. But if
17830: I take the matter which is indicated by this name, and submit it to the
17831: examination of my senses, I am enabled to form several
17832: synthetical—although still empirical—propositions. The mathematical
17833: conception of a triangle I should construct, that is, present à priori
17834: in intuition, and in this way attain to rational-synthetical cognition.
17835: But when the transcendental conception of reality, or substance, or
17836: power is presented to my mind, I find that it does not relate to or
17837: indicate either an empirical or pure intuition, but that it indicates
17838: merely the synthesis of empirical intuitions, which cannot of course be
17839: given à priori. The synthesis in such a conception cannot proceed à
17840: priori—without the aid of experience—to the intuition which corresponds
17841: to the conception; and, for this reason, none of these conceptions can
17842: produce a determinative synthetical proposition, they can never present
17843: more than a principle of the synthesis[75] of possible empirical
17844: intuitions. A transcendental proposition is, therefore, a synthetical
17845: cognition of reason by means of pure conceptions and the discursive
17846: method, and it renders possible all synthetical unity in empirical
17847: cognition, though it cannot present us with any intuition à priori.
17848: 
17849:  [75] In the case of the conception of cause, I do really go beyond the
17850:  empirical conception of an event—but not to the intuition which
17851:  presents this conception in concreto, but only to the time-conditions,
17852:  which may be found in experience to correspond to the conception. My
17853:  procedure is, therefore, strictly according to conceptions; I cannot
17854:  in a case of this kind employ the construction of conceptions, because
17855:  the conception is merely a rule for the synthesis of perceptions,
17856:  which are not pure intuitions, and which, therefore, cannot be given à
17857:  priori.
17858: 
17859: 
17860: There is thus a twofold exercise of reason. Both modes have the
17861: properties of universality and an à priori origin in common, but are,
17862: in their procedure, of widely different character. The reason of this
17863: is that in the world of phenomena, in which alone objects are presented
17864: to our minds, there are two main elements—the form of intuition (space
17865: and time), which can be cognized and determined completely à priori,
17866: and the matter or content—that which is presented in space and time,
17867: and which, consequently, contains a something—an existence
17868: corresponding to our powers of sensation. As regards the latter, which
17869: can never be given in a determinate mode except by experience, there
17870: are no à priori notions which relate to it, except the undetermined
17871: conceptions of the synthesis of possible sensations, in so far as these
17872: belong (in a possible experience) to the unity of consciousness. As
17873: regards the former, we can determine our conceptions à priori in
17874: intuition, inasmuch as we are ourselves the creators of the objects of
17875: the conceptions in space and time—these objects being regarded simply
17876: as quanta. In the one case, reason proceeds according to conceptions
17877: and can do nothing more than subject phenomena to these—which can only
17878: be determined empirically, that is, à posteriori—in conformity,
17879: however, with those conceptions as the rules of all empirical
17880: synthesis. In the other case, reason proceeds by the construction of
17881: conceptions; and, as these conceptions relate to an à priori intuition,
17882: they may be given and determined in pure intuition à priori, and
17883: without the aid of empirical data. The examination and consideration of
17884: everything that exists in space or time—whether it is a quantum or not,
17885: in how far the particular something (which fills space or time) is a
17886: primary substratum, or a mere determination of some other existence,
17887: whether it relates to anything else—either as cause or effect, whether
17888: its existence is isolated or in reciprocal connection with and
17889: dependence upon others, the possibility of this existence, its reality
17890: and necessity or opposites—all these form part of the cognition of
17891: reason on the ground of conceptions, and this cognition is termed
17892: philosophical. But to determine à priori an intuition in space (its
17893: figure), to divide time into periods, or merely to cognize the quantity
17894: of an intuition in space and time, and to determine it by number—all
17895: this is an operation of reason by means of the construction of
17896: conceptions, and is called mathematical.
17897: 
17898: The success which attends the efforts of reason in the sphere of
17899: mathematics naturally fosters the expectation that the same good
17900: fortune will be its lot, if it applies the mathematical method in other
17901: regions of mental endeavour besides that of quantities. Its success is
17902: thus great, because it can support all its conceptions by à priori
17903: intuitions and, in this way, make itself a master, as it were, over
17904: nature; while pure philosophy, with its à priori discursive
17905: conceptions, bungles about in the world of nature, and cannot accredit
17906: or show any à priori evidence of the reality of these conceptions.
17907: Masters in the science of mathematics are confident of the success of
17908: this method; indeed, it is a common persuasion that it is capable of
17909: being applied to any subject of human thought. They have hardly ever
17910: reflected or philosophized on their favourite science—a task of great
17911: difficulty; and the specific difference between the two modes of
17912: employing the faculty of reason has never entered their thoughts. Rules
17913: current in the field of common experience, and which common sense
17914: stamps everywhere with its approval, are regarded by them as axiomatic.
17915: From what source the conceptions of space and time, with which (as the
17916: only primitive quanta) they have to deal, enter their minds, is a
17917: question which they do not trouble themselves to answer; and they think
17918: it just as unnecessary to examine into the origin of the pure
17919: conceptions of the understanding and the extent of their validity. All
17920: they have to do with them is to employ them. In all this they are
17921: perfectly right, if they do not overstep the limits of the sphere of
17922: nature. But they pass, unconsciously, from the world of sense to the
17923: insecure ground of pure transcendental conceptions (instabilis tellus,
17924: innabilis unda), where they can neither stand nor swim, and where the
17925: tracks of their footsteps are obliterated by time; while the march of
17926: mathematics is pursued on a broad and magnificent highway, which the
17927: latest posterity shall frequent without fear of danger or impediment.
17928: 
17929: As we have taken upon us the task of determining, clearly and
17930: certainly, the limits of pure reason in the sphere of
17931: transcendentalism, and as the efforts of reason in this direction are
17932: persisted in, even after the plainest and most expressive warnings,
17933: hope still beckoning us past the limits of experience into the
17934: splendours of the intellectual world—it becomes necessary to cut away
17935: the last anchor of this fallacious and fantastic hope. We shall,
17936: accordingly, show that the mathematical method is unattended in the
17937: sphere of philosophy by the least advantage—except, perhaps, that it
17938: more plainly exhibits its own inadequacy—that geometry and philosophy
17939: are two quite different things, although they go hand in hand in the
17940: field of natural science, and, consequently, that the procedure of the
17941: one can never be imitated by the other.
17942: 
17943: The evidence of mathematics rests upon definitions, axioms, and
17944: demonstrations. I shall be satisfied with showing that none of these
17945: forms can be employed or imitated in philosophy in the sense in which
17946: they are understood by mathematicians; and that the geometrician, if he
17947: employs his method in philosophy, will succeed only in building
17948: card-castles, while the employment of the philosophical method in
17949: mathematics can result in nothing but mere verbiage. The essential
17950: business of philosophy, indeed, is to mark out the limits of the
17951: science; and even the mathematician, unless his talent is naturally
17952: circumscribed and limited to this particular department of knowledge,
17953: cannot turn a deaf ear to the warnings of philosophy, or set himself
17954: above its direction.
17955: 
17956: I. Of Definitions. A definition is, as the term itself indicates, the
17957: representation, upon primary grounds, of the complete conception of a
17958: thing within its own limits.[76] Accordingly, an empirical conception
17959: cannot be defined, it can only be explained. For, as there are in such
17960: a conception only a certain number of marks or signs, which denote a
17961: certain class of sensuous objects, we can never be sure that we do not
17962: cogitate under the word which indicates the same object, at one time a
17963: greater, at another a smaller number of signs. Thus, one person may
17964: cogitate in his conception of gold, in addition to its properties of
17965: weight, colour, malleability, that of resisting rust, while another
17966: person may be ignorant of this quality. We employ certain signs only so
17967: long as we require them for the sake of distinction; new observations
17968: abstract some and add new ones, so that an empirical conception never
17969: remains within permanent limits. It is, in fact, useless to define a
17970: conception of this kind. If, for example, we are speaking of water and
17971: its properties, we do not stop at what we actually think by the word
17972: water, but proceed to observation and experiment; and the word, with
17973: the few signs attached to it, is more properly a designation than a
17974: conception of the thing. A definition in this case would evidently be
17975: nothing more than a determination of the word. In the second place, no
17976: à priori conception, such as those of substance, cause, right, fitness,
17977: and so on, can be defined. For I can never be sure, that the clear
17978: representation of a given conception (which is given in a confused
17979: state) has been fully developed, until I know that the representation
17980: is adequate with its object. But, inasmuch as the conception, as it is
17981: presented to the mind, may contain a number of obscure representations,
17982: which we do not observe in our analysis, although we employ them in our
17983: application of the conception, I can never be sure that my analysis is
17984: complete, while examples may make this probable, although they can
17985: never demonstrate the fact. Instead of the word definition, I should
17986: rather employ the term exposition—a more modest expression, which the
17987: critic may accept without surrendering his doubts as to the
17988: completeness of the analysis of any such conception. As, therefore,
17989: neither empirical nor à priori conceptions are capable of definition,
17990: we have to see whether the only other kind of conceptions—arbitrary
17991: conceptions—can be subjected to this mental operation. Such a
17992: conception can always be defined; for I must know thoroughly what I
17993: wished to cogitate in it, as it was I who created it, and it was not
17994: given to my mind either by the nature of my understanding or by
17995: experience. At the same time, I cannot say that, by such a definition,
17996: I have defined a real object. If the conception is based upon empirical
17997: conditions, if, for example, I have a conception of a clock for a ship,
17998: this arbitrary conception does not assure me of the existence or even
17999: of the possibility of the object. My definition of such a conception
18000: would with more propriety be termed a declaration of a project than a
18001: definition of an object. There are no other conceptions which can bear
18002: definition, except those which contain an arbitrary synthesis, which
18003: can be constructed à priori. Consequently, the science of mathematics
18004: alone possesses definitions. For the object here thought is presented à
18005: priori in intuition; and thus it can never contain more or less than
18006: the conception, because the conception of the object has been given by
18007: the definition—and primarily, that is, without deriving the definition
18008: from any other source. Philosophical definitions are, therefore, merely
18009: expositions of given conceptions, while mathematical definitions are
18010: constructions of conceptions originally formed by the mind itself; the
18011: former are produced by analysis, the completeness of which is never
18012: demonstratively certain, the latter by a synthesis. In a mathematical
18013: definition the conception is formed, in a philosophical definition it
18014: is only explained. From this it follows:
18015: 
18016:  [76] The definition must describe the conception completely that is,
18017:  omit none of the marks or signs of which it composed; within its own
18018:  limits, that is, it must be precise, and enumerate no more signs than
18019:  belong to the conception; and on primary grounds, that is to say, the
18020:  limitations of the bounds of the conception must not be deduced from
18021:  other conceptions, as in this case a proof would be necessary, and the
18022:  so-called definition would be incapable of taking its place at the
18023:  head of all the judgements we have to form regarding an object.
18024: 
18025: 
18026: (a) That we must not imitate, in philosophy, the mathematical usage of
18027: commencing with definitions—except by way of hypothesis or experiment.
18028: For, as all so-called philosophical definitions are merely analyses of
18029: given conceptions, these conceptions, although only in a confused form,
18030: must precede the analysis; and the incomplete exposition must precede
18031: the complete, so that we may be able to draw certain inferences from
18032: the characteristics which an incomplete analysis has enabled us to
18033: discover, before we attain to the complete exposition or definition of
18034: the conception. In one word, a full and clear definition ought, in
18035: philosophy, rather to form the conclusion than the commencement of our
18036: labours.[77] In mathematics, on the contrary, we cannot have a
18037: conception prior to the definition; it is the definition which gives us
18038: the conception, and it must for this reason form the commencement of
18039: every chain of mathematical reasoning.
18040: 
18041:  [77] Philosophy abounds in faulty definitions, especially such as
18042:  contain some of the elements requisite to form a complete definition.
18043:  If a conception could not be employed in reasoning before it had been
18044:  defined, it would fare ill with all philosophical thought. But, as
18045:  incompletely defined conceptions may always be employed without
18046:  detriment to truth, so far as our analysis of the elements contained
18047:  in them proceeds, imperfect definitions, that is, propositions which
18048:  are properly not definitions, but merely approximations thereto, may
18049:  be used with great advantage. In mathematics, definition belongs ad
18050:  esse, in philosophy ad melius esse. It is a difficult task to
18051:  construct a proper definition. Jurists are still without a complete
18052:  definition of the idea of right.
18053: 
18054: 
18055: (b) Mathematical definitions cannot be erroneous. For the conception is
18056: given only in and through the definition, and thus it contains only
18057: what has been cogitated in the definition. But although a definition
18058: cannot be incorrect, as regards its content, an error may sometimes,
18059: although seldom, creep into the form. This error consists in a want of
18060: precision. Thus the common definition of a circle—that it is a curved
18061: line, every point in which is equally distant from another point called
18062: the centre—is faulty, from the fact that the determination indicated by
18063: the word curved is superfluous. For there ought to be a particular
18064: theorem, which may be easily proved from the definition, to the effect
18065: that every line, which has all its points at equal distances from
18066: another point, must be a curved line—that is, that not even the
18067: smallest part of it can be straight. Analytical definitions, on the
18068: other hand, may be erroneous in many respects, either by the
18069: introduction of signs which do not actually exist in the conception, or
18070: by wanting in that completeness which forms the essential of a
18071: definition. In the latter case, the definition is necessarily
18072: defective, because we can never be fully certain of the completeness of
18073: our analysis. For these reasons, the method of definition employed in
18074: mathematics cannot be imitated in philosophy.
18075: 
18076: 2. Of Axioms. These, in so far as they are immediately certain, are à
18077: priori synthetical principles. Now, one conception cannot be connected
18078: synthetically and yet immediately with another; because, if we wish to
18079: proceed out of and beyond a conception, a third mediating cognition is
18080: necessary. And, as philosophy is a cognition of reason by the aid of
18081: conceptions alone, there is to be found in it no principle which
18082: deserves to be called an axiom. Mathematics, on the other hand, may
18083: possess axioms, because it can always connect the predicates of an
18084: object à priori, and without any mediating term, by means of the
18085: construction of conceptions in intuition. Such is the case with the
18086: proposition: Three points can always lie in a plane. On the other hand,
18087: no synthetical principle which is based upon conceptions, can ever be
18088: immediately certain (for example, the proposition: Everything that
18089: happens has a cause), because I require a mediating term to connect the
18090: two conceptions of event and cause—namely, the condition of
18091: time-determination in an experience, and I cannot cognize any such
18092: principle immediately and from conceptions alone. Discursive principles
18093: are, accordingly, very different from intuitive principles or axioms.
18094: The former always require deduction, which in the case of the latter
18095: may be altogether dispensed with. Axioms are, for this reason, always
18096: self-evident, while philosophical principles, whatever may be the
18097: degree of certainty they possess, cannot lay any claim to such a
18098: distinction. No synthetical proposition of pure transcendental reason
18099: can be so evident, as is often rashly enough declared, as the
18100: statement, twice two are four. It is true that in the Analytic I
18101: introduced into the list of principles of the pure understanding,
18102: certain axioms of intuition; but the principle there discussed was not
18103: itself an axiom, but served merely to present the principle of the
18104: possibility of axioms in general, while it was really nothing more than
18105: a principle based upon conceptions. For it is one part of the duty of
18106: transcendental philosophy to establish the possibility of mathematics
18107: itself. Philosophy possesses, then, no axioms, and has no right to
18108: impose its à priori principles upon thought, until it has established
18109: their authority and validity by a thoroughgoing deduction.
18110: 
18111: 3. Of Demonstrations. Only an apodeictic proof, based upon intuition,
18112: can be termed a demonstration. Experience teaches us what is, but it
18113: cannot convince us that it might not have been otherwise. Hence a proof
18114: upon empirical grounds cannot be apodeictic. À priori conceptions, in
18115: discursive cognition, can never produce intuitive certainty or
18116: evidence, however certain the judgement they present may be.
18117: Mathematics alone, therefore, contains demonstrations, because it does
18118: not deduce its cognition from conceptions, but from the construction of
18119: conceptions, that is, from intuition, which can be given à priori in
18120: accordance with conceptions. The method of algebra, in equations, from
18121: which the correct answer is deduced by reduction, is a kind of
18122: construction—not geometrical, but by symbols—in which all conceptions,
18123: especially those of the relations of quantities, are represented in
18124: intuition by signs; and thus the conclusions in that science are
18125: secured from errors by the fact that every proof is submitted to ocular
18126: evidence. Philosophical cognition does not possess this advantage, it
18127: being required to consider the general always in abstracto (by means of
18128: conceptions), while mathematics can always consider it in concreto (in
18129: an individual intuition), and at the same time by means of à priori
18130: representation, whereby all errors are rendered manifest to the senses.
18131: The former—discursive proofs—ought to be termed acroamatic proofs,
18132: rather than demonstrations, as only words are employed in them, while
18133: demonstrations proper, as the term itself indicates, always require a
18134: reference to the intuition of the object.
18135: 
18136: It follows from all these considerations that it is not consonant with
18137: the nature of philosophy, especially in the sphere of pure reason, to
18138: employ the dogmatical method, and to adorn itself with the titles and
18139: insignia of mathematical science. It does not belong to that order, and
18140: can only hope for a fraternal union with that science. Its attempts at
18141: mathematical evidence are vain pretensions, which can only keep it back
18142: from its true aim, which is to detect the illusory procedure of reason
18143: when transgressing its proper limits, and by fully explaining and
18144: analysing our conceptions, to conduct us from the dim regions of
18145: speculation to the clear region of modest self-knowledge. Reason must
18146: not, therefore, in its transcendental endeavours, look forward with
18147: such confidence, as if the path it is pursuing led straight to its aim,
18148: nor reckon with such security upon its premisses, as to consider it
18149: unnecessary to take a step back, or to keep a strict watch for errors,
18150: which, overlooked in the principles, may be detected in the arguments
18151: themselves—in which case it may be requisite either to determine these
18152: principles with greater strictness, or to change them entirely.
18153: 
18154: I divide all apodeictic propositions, whether demonstrable or
18155: immediately certain, into dogmata and mathemata. A direct synthetical
18156: proposition, based on conceptions, is a dogma; a proposition of the
18157: same kind, based on the construction of conceptions, is a mathema.
18158: Analytical judgements do not teach us any more about an object than
18159: what was contained in the conception we had of it; because they do not
18160: extend our cognition beyond our conception of an object, they merely
18161: elucidate the conception. They cannot therefore be with propriety
18162: termed dogmas. Of the two kinds of à priori synthetical propositions
18163: above mentioned, only those which are employed in philosophy can,
18164: according to the general mode of speech, bear this name; those of
18165: arithmetic or geometry would not be rightly so denominated. Thus the
18166: customary mode of speaking confirms the explanation given above, and
18167: the conclusion arrived at, that only those judgements which are based
18168: upon conceptions, not on the construction of conceptions, can be termed
18169: dogmatical.
18170: 
18171: Thus, pure reason, in the sphere of speculation, does not contain a
18172: single direct synthetical judgement based upon conceptions. By means of
18173: ideas, it is, as we have shown, incapable of producing synthetical
18174: judgements, which are objectively valid; by means of the conceptions of
18175: the understanding, it establishes certain indubitable principles, not,
18176: however, directly on the basis of conceptions, but only indirectly by
18177: means of the relation of these conceptions to something of a purely
18178: contingent nature, namely, possible experience. When experience is
18179: presupposed, these principles are apodeictically certain, but in
18180: themselves, and directly, they cannot even be cognized à priori. Thus
18181: the given conceptions of cause and event will not be sufficient for the
18182: demonstration of the proposition: Every event has a cause. For this
18183: reason, it is not a dogma; although from another point of view, that of
18184: experience, it is capable of being proved to demonstration. The proper
18185: term for such a proposition is principle, and not theorem (although it
18186: does require to be proved), because it possesses the remarkable
18187: peculiarity of being the condition of the possibility of its own ground
18188: of proof, that is, experience, and of forming a necessary
18189: presupposition in all empirical observation.
18190: 
18191: If then, in the speculative sphere of pure reason, no dogmata are to be
18192: found; all dogmatical methods, whether borrowed from mathematics, or
18193: invented by philosophical thinkers, are alike inappropriate and
18194: inefficient. They only serve to conceal errors and fallacies, and to
18195: deceive philosophy, whose duty it is to see that reason pursues a safe
18196: and straight path. A philosophical method may, however, be
18197: systematical. For our reason is, subjectively considered, itself a
18198: system, and, in the sphere of mere conceptions, a system of
18199: investigation according to principles of unity, the material being
18200: supplied by experience alone. But this is not the proper place for
18201: discussing the peculiar method of transcendental philosophy, as our
18202: present task is simply to examine whether our faculties are capable of
18203: erecting an edifice on the basis of pure reason, and how far they may
18204: proceed with the materials at their command.
18205: 
18206: Section II. The Discipline of Pure Reason in Polemics
18207: 
18208: Reason must be subject, in all its operations, to criticism, which must
18209: always be permitted to exercise its functions without restraint;
18210: otherwise its interests are imperilled and its influence obnoxious to
18211: suspicion. There is nothing, however useful, however sacred it may be,
18212: that can claim exemption from the searching examination of this supreme
18213: tribunal, which has no respect of persons. The very existence of reason
18214: depends upon this freedom; for the voice of reason is not that of a
18215: dictatorial and despotic power, it is rather like the vote of the
18216: citizens of a free state, every member of which must have the privilege
18217: of giving free expression to his doubts, and possess even the right of
18218: veto.
18219: 
18220: But while reason can never decline to submit itself to the tribunal of
18221: criticism, it has not always cause to dread the judgement of this
18222: court. Pure reason, however, when engaged in the sphere of dogmatism,
18223: is not so thoroughly conscious of a strict observance of its highest
18224: laws, as to appear before a higher judicial reason with perfect
18225: confidence. On the contrary, it must renounce its magnificent
18226: dogmatical pretensions in philosophy.
18227: 
18228: Very different is the case when it has to defend itself, not before a
18229: judge, but against an equal. If dogmatical assertions are advanced on
18230: the negative side, in opposition to those made by reason on the
18231: positive side, its justification kat authrhopon is complete, although
18232: the proof of its propositions is kat aletheian unsatisfactory.
18233: 
18234: By the polemic of pure reason I mean the defence of its propositions
18235: made by reason, in opposition to the dogmatical counter-propositions
18236: advanced by other parties. The question here is not whether its own
18237: statements may not also be false; it merely regards the fact that
18238: reason proves that the opposite cannot be established with
18239: demonstrative certainty, nor even asserted with a higher degree of
18240: probability. Reason does not hold her possessions upon sufferance; for,
18241: although she cannot show a perfectly satisfactory title to them, no one
18242: can prove that she is not the rightful possessor.
18243: 
18244: It is a melancholy reflection that reason, in its highest exercise,
18245: falls into an antithetic; and that the supreme tribunal for the
18246: settlement of differences should not be at union with itself. It is
18247: true that we had to discuss the question of an apparent antithetic, but
18248: we found that it was based upon a misconception. In conformity with the
18249: common prejudice, phenomena were regarded as things in themselves, and
18250: thus an absolute completeness in their synthesis was required in the
18251: one mode or in the other (it was shown to be impossible in both); a
18252: demand entirely out of place in regard to phenomena. There was, then,
18253: no real self-contradiction of reason in the propositions: The series of
18254: phenomena given in themselves has an absolutely first beginning; and:
18255: This series is absolutely and in itself without beginning. The two
18256: propositions are perfectly consistent with each other, because
18257: phenomena as phenomena are in themselves nothing, and consequently the
18258: hypothesis that they are things in themselves must lead to
18259: self-contradictory inferences.
18260: 
18261: But there are cases in which a similar misunderstanding cannot be
18262: provided against, and the dispute must remain unsettled. Take, for
18263: example, the theistic proposition: There is a Supreme Being; and on the
18264: other hand, the atheistic counter-statement: There exists no Supreme
18265: Being; or, in psychology: Everything that thinks possesses the
18266: attribute of absolute and permanent unity, which is utterly different
18267: from the transitory unity of material phenomena; and the
18268: counter-proposition: The soul is not an immaterial unity, and its
18269: nature is transitory, like that of phenomena. The objects of these
18270: questions contain no heterogeneous or contradictory elements, for they
18271: relate to things in themselves, and not to phenomena. There would
18272: arise, indeed, a real contradiction, if reason came forward with a
18273: statement on the negative side of these questions alone. As regards the
18274: criticism to which the grounds of proof on the affirmative side must be
18275: subjected, it may be freely admitted, without necessitating the
18276: surrender of the affirmative propositions, which have, at least, the
18277: interest of reason in their favour—an advantage which the opposite
18278: party cannot lay claim to.
18279: 
18280: I cannot agree with the opinion of several admirable thinkers—Sulzer
18281: among the rest—that, in spite of the weakness of the arguments hitherto
18282: in use, we may hope, one day, to see sufficient demonstrations of the
18283: two cardinal propositions of pure reason—the existence of a Supreme
18284: Being, and the immortality of the soul. I am certain, on the contrary,
18285: that this will never be the case. For on what ground can reason base
18286: such synthetical propositions, which do not relate to the objects of
18287: experience and their internal possibility? But it is also
18288: demonstratively certain that no one will ever be able to maintain the
18289: contrary with the least show of probability. For, as he can attempt
18290: such a proof solely upon the basis of pure reason, he is bound to prove
18291: that a Supreme Being, and a thinking subject in the character of a pure
18292: intelligence, are impossible. But where will he find the knowledge
18293: which can enable him to enounce synthetical judgements in regard to
18294: things which transcend the region of experience? We may, therefore,
18295: rest assured that the opposite never will be demonstrated. We need not,
18296: then, have recourse to scholastic arguments; we may always admit the
18297: truth of those propositions which are consistent with the speculative
18298: interests of reason in the sphere of experience, and form, moreover,
18299: the only means of uniting the speculative with the practical interest.
18300: Our opponent, who must not be considered here as a critic solely, we
18301: can be ready to meet with a non liquet which cannot fail to disconcert
18302: him; while we cannot deny his right to a similar retort, as we have on
18303: our side the advantage of the support of the subjective maxim of
18304: reason, and can therefore look upon all his sophistical arguments with
18305: calm indifference.
18306: 
18307: From this point of view, there is properly no antithetic of pure
18308: reason. For the only arena for such a struggle would be upon the field
18309: of pure theology and psychology; but on this ground there can appear no
18310: combatant whom we need to fear. Ridicule and boasting can be his only
18311: weapons; and these may be laughed at, as mere child’s play. This
18312: consideration restores to Reason her courage; for what source of
18313: confidence could be found, if she, whose vocation it is to destroy
18314: error, were at variance with herself and without any reasonable hope of
18315: ever reaching a state of permanent repose?
18316: 
18317: Everything in nature is good for some purpose. Even poisons are
18318: serviceable; they destroy the evil effects of other poisons generated
18319: in our system, and must always find a place in every complete
18320: pharmacopoeia. The objections raised against the fallacies and
18321: sophistries of speculative reason, are objections given by the nature
18322: of this reason itself, and must therefore have a destination and
18323: purpose which can only be for the good of humanity. For what purpose
18324: has Providence raised many objects, in which we have the deepest
18325: interest, so far above us, that we vainly try to cognize them with
18326: certainty, and our powers of mental vision are rather excited than
18327: satisfied by the glimpses we may chance to seize? It is very doubtful
18328: whether it is for our benefit to advance bold affirmations regarding
18329: subjects involved in such obscurity; perhaps it would even be
18330: detrimental to our best interests. But it is undoubtedly always
18331: beneficial to leave the investigating, as well as the critical reason,
18332: in perfect freedom, and permit it to take charge of its own interests,
18333: which are advanced as much by its limitation, as by its extension of
18334: its views, and which always suffer by the interference of foreign
18335: powers forcing it, against its natural tendencies, to bend to certain
18336: preconceived designs.
18337: 
18338: Allow your opponent to say what he thinks reasonable, and combat him
18339: only with the weapons of reason. Have no anxiety for the practical
18340: interests of humanity—these are never imperilled in a purely
18341: speculative dispute. Such a dispute serves merely to disclose the
18342: antinomy of reason, which, as it has its source in the nature of
18343: reason, ought to be thoroughly investigated. Reason is benefited by the
18344: examination of a subject on both sides, and its judgements are
18345: corrected by being limited. It is not the matter that may give occasion
18346: to dispute, but the manner. For it is perfectly permissible to employ,
18347: in the presence of reason, the language of a firmly rooted faith, even
18348: after we have been obliged to renounce all pretensions to knowledge.
18349: 
18350: If we were to ask the dispassionate David Hume—a philosopher endowed,
18351: in a degree that few are, with a well-balanced judgement: What motive
18352: induced you to spend so much labour and thought in undermining the
18353: consoling and beneficial persuasion that reason is capable of assuring
18354: us of the existence, and presenting us with a determinate conception of
18355: a Supreme Being?—his answer would be: Nothing but the desire of
18356: teaching reason to know its own powers better, and, at the same time, a
18357: dislike of the procedure by which that faculty was compelled to support
18358: foregone conclusions, and prevented from confessing the internal
18359: weaknesses which it cannot but feel when it enters upon a rigid
18360: self-examination. If, on the other hand, we were to ask Priestley—a
18361: philosopher who had no taste for transcendental speculation, but was
18362: entirely devoted to the principles of empiricism—what his motives were
18363: for overturning those two main pillars of religion—the doctrines of the
18364: freedom of the will and the immortality of the soul (in his view the
18365: hope of a future life is but the expectation of the miracle of
18366: resurrection)—this philosopher, himself a zealous and pious teacher of
18367: religion, could give no other answer than this: I acted in the interest
18368: of reason, which always suffers, when certain objects are explained and
18369: judged by a reference to other supposed laws than those of material
18370: nature—the only laws which we know in a determinate manner. It would be
18371: unfair to decry the latter philosopher, who endeavoured to harmonize
18372: his paradoxical opinions with the interests of religion, and to
18373: undervalue an honest and reflecting man, because he finds himself at a
18374: loss the moment he has left the field of natural science. The same
18375: grace must be accorded to Hume, a man not less well-disposed, and quite
18376: as blameless in his moral character, and who pushed his abstract
18377: speculations to an extreme length, because, as he rightly believed, the
18378: object of them lies entirely beyond the bounds of natural science, and
18379: within the sphere of pure ideas.
18380: 
18381: What is to be done to provide against the danger which seems in the
18382: present case to menace the best interests of humanity? The course to be
18383: pursued in reference to this subject is a perfectly plain and natural
18384: one. Let each thinker pursue his own path; if he shows talent, if he
18385: gives evidence of profound thought, in one word, if he shows that he
18386: possesses the power of reasoning—reason is always the gainer. If you
18387: have recourse to other means, if you attempt to coerce reason, if you
18388: raise the cry of treason to humanity, if you excite the feelings of the
18389: crowd, which can neither understand nor sympathize with such subtle
18390: speculations—you will only make yourselves ridiculous. For the question
18391: does not concern the advantage or disadvantage which we are expected to
18392: reap from such inquiries; the question is merely how far reason can
18393: advance in the field of speculation, apart from all kinds of interest,
18394: and whether we may depend upon the exertions of speculative reason, or
18395: must renounce all reliance on it. Instead of joining the combatants, it
18396: is your part to be a tranquil spectator of the struggle—a laborious
18397: struggle for the parties engaged, but attended, in its progress as well
18398: as in its result, with the most advantageous consequences for the
18399: interests of thought and knowledge. It is absurd to expect to be
18400: enlightened by Reason, and at the same time to prescribe to her what
18401: side of the question she must adopt. Moreover, reason is sufficiently
18402: held in check by its own power, the limits imposed on it by its own
18403: nature are sufficient; it is unnecessary for you to place over it
18404: additional guards, as if its power were dangerous to the constitution
18405: of the intellectual state. In the dialectic of reason there is no
18406: victory gained which need in the least disturb your tranquility.
18407: 
18408: The strife of dialectic is a necessity of reason, and we cannot but
18409: wish that it had been conducted long ere this with that perfect freedom
18410: which ought to be its essential condition. In this case, we should have
18411: had at an earlier period a matured and profound criticism, which must
18412: have put an end to all dialectical disputes, by exposing the illusions
18413: and prejudices in which they originated.
18414: 
18415: There is in human nature an unworthy propensity—a propensity which,
18416: like everything that springs from nature, must in its final purpose be
18417: conducive to the good of humanity—to conceal our real sentiments, and
18418: to give expression only to certain received opinions, which are
18419: regarded as at once safe and promotive of the common good. It is true,
18420: this tendency, not only to conceal our real sentiments, but to profess
18421: those which may gain us favour in the eyes of society, has not only
18422: civilized, but, in a certain measure, moralized us; as no one can break
18423: through the outward covering of respectability, honour, and morality,
18424: and thus the seemingly-good examples which we see around us form an
18425: excellent school for moral improvement, so long as our belief in their
18426: genuineness remains unshaken. But this disposition to represent
18427: ourselves as better than we are, and to utter opinions which are not
18428: our own, can be nothing more than a kind of provisionary arrangement of
18429: nature to lead us from the rudeness of an uncivilized state, and to
18430: teach us how to assume at least the appearance and manner of the good
18431: we see. But when true principles have been developed, and have obtained
18432: a sure foundation in our habit of thought, this conventionalism must be
18433: attacked with earnest vigour, otherwise it corrupts the heart, and
18434: checks the growth of good dispositions with the mischievous weed of
18435: fair appearances.
18436: 
18437: I am sorry to remark the same tendency to misrepresentation and
18438: hypocrisy in the sphere of speculative discussion, where there is less
18439: temptation to restrain the free expression of thought. For what can be
18440: more prejudicial to the interests of intelligence than to falsify our
18441: real sentiments, to conceal the doubts which we feel in regard to our
18442: statements, or to maintain the validity of grounds of proof which we
18443: well know to be insufficient? So long as mere personal vanity is the
18444: source of these unworthy artifices—and this is generally the case in
18445: speculative discussions, which are mostly destitute of practical
18446: interest, and are incapable of complete demonstration—the vanity of the
18447: opposite party exaggerates as much on the other side; and thus the
18448: result is the same, although it is not brought about so soon as if the
18449: dispute had been conducted in a sincere and upright spirit. But where
18450: the mass entertains the notion that the aim of certain subtle
18451: speculators is nothing less than to shake the very foundations of
18452: public welfare and morality—it seems not only prudent, but even praise
18453: worthy, to maintain the good cause by illusory arguments, rather than
18454: to give to our supposed opponents the advantage of lowering our
18455: declarations to the moderate tone of a merely practical conviction, and
18456: of compelling us to confess our inability to attain to apodeictic
18457: certainty in speculative subjects. But we ought to reflect that there
18458: is nothing, in the world more fatal to the maintenance of a good cause
18459: than deceit, misrepresentation, and falsehood. That the strictest laws
18460: of honesty should be observed in the discussion of a purely speculative
18461: subject is the least requirement that can be made. If we could reckon
18462: with security even upon so little, the conflict of speculative reason
18463: regarding the important questions of God, immortality, and freedom,
18464: would have been either decided long ago, or would very soon be brought
18465: to a conclusion. But, in general, the uprightness of the defence stands
18466: in an inverse ratio to the goodness of the cause; and perhaps more
18467: honesty and fairness are shown by those who deny than by those who
18468: uphold these doctrines.
18469: 
18470: I shall persuade myself, then, that I have readers who do not wish to
18471: see a righteous cause defended by unfair arguments. Such will now
18472: recognize the fact that, according to the principles of this Critique,
18473: if we consider not what is, but what ought to be the case, there can be
18474: really no polemic of pure reason. For how can two persons dispute about
18475: a thing, the reality of which neither can present in actual or even in
18476: possible experience? Each adopts the plan of meditating on his idea for
18477: the purpose of drawing from the idea, if he can, what is more than the
18478: idea, that is, the reality of the object which it indicates. How shall
18479: they settle the dispute, since neither is able to make his assertions
18480: directly comprehensible and certain, but must restrict himself to
18481: attacking and confuting those of his opponent? All statements enounced
18482: by pure reason transcend the conditions of possible experience, beyond
18483: the sphere of which we can discover no criterion of truth, while they
18484: are at the same time framed in accordance with the laws of the
18485: understanding, which are applicable only to experience; and thus it is
18486: the fate of all such speculative discussions that while the one party
18487: attacks the weaker side of his opponent, he infallibly lays open his
18488: own weaknesses.
18489: 
18490: The critique of pure reason may be regarded as the highest tribunal for
18491: all speculative disputes; for it is not involved in these disputes,
18492: which have an immediate relation to certain objects and not to the laws
18493: of the mind, but is instituted for the purpose of determining the
18494: rights and limits of reason.
18495: 
18496: Without the control of criticism, reason is, as it were, in a state of
18497: nature, and can only establish its claims and assertions by war.
18498: Criticism, on the contrary, deciding all questions according to the
18499: fundamental laws of its own institution, secures to us the peace of law
18500: and order, and enables us to discuss all differences in the more
18501: tranquil manner of a legal process. In the former case, disputes are
18502: ended by victory, which both sides may claim and which is followed by a
18503: hollow armistice; in the latter, by a sentence, which, as it strikes at
18504: the root of all speculative differences, ensures to all concerned a
18505: lasting peace. The endless disputes of a dogmatizing reason compel us
18506: to look for some mode of arriving at a settled decision by a critical
18507: investigation of reason itself; just as Hobbes maintains that the state
18508: of nature is a state of injustice and violence, and that we must leave
18509: it and submit ourselves to the constraint of law, which indeed limits
18510: individual freedom, but only that it may consist with the freedom of
18511: others and with the common good of all.
18512: 
18513: This freedom will, among other things, permit of our openly stating the
18514: difficulties and doubts which we are ourselves unable to solve, without
18515: being decried on that account as turbulent and dangerous citizens. This
18516: privilege forms part of the native rights of human reason, which
18517: recognizes no other judge than the universal reason of humanity; and as
18518: this reason is the source of all progress and improvement, such a
18519: privilege is to be held sacred and inviolable. It is unwise, moreover,
18520: to denounce as dangerous any bold assertions against, or rash attacks
18521: upon, an opinion which is held by the largest and most moral class of
18522: the community; for that would be giving them an importance which they
18523: do not deserve. When I hear that the freedom of the will, the hope of a
18524: future life, and the existence of God have been overthrown by the
18525: arguments of some able writer, I feel a strong desire to read his book;
18526: for I expect that he will add to my knowledge and impart greater
18527: clearness and distinctness to my views by the argumentative power shown
18528: in his writings. But I am perfectly certain, even before I have opened
18529: the book, that he has not succeeded in a single point, not because I
18530: believe I am in possession of irrefutable demonstrations of these
18531: important propositions, but because this transcendental critique, which
18532: has disclosed to me the power and the limits of pure reason, has fully
18533: convinced me that, as it is insufficient to establish the affirmative,
18534: it is as powerless, and even more so, to assure us of the truth of the
18535: negative answer to these questions. From what source does this
18536: free-thinker derive his knowledge that there is, for example, no
18537: Supreme Being? This proposition lies out of the field of possible
18538: experience, and, therefore, beyond the limits of human cognition. But I
18539: would not read at, all the answer which the dogmatical maintainer of
18540: the good cause makes to his opponent, because I know well beforehand,
18541: that he will merely attack the fallacious grounds of his adversary,
18542: without being able to establish his own assertions. Besides, a new
18543: illusory argument, in the construction of which talent and acuteness
18544: are shown, is suggestive of new ideas and new trains of reasoning, and
18545: in this respect the old and everyday sophistries are quite useless.
18546: Again, the dogmatical opponent of religion gives employment to
18547: criticism, and enables us to test and correct its principles, while
18548: there is no occasion for anxiety in regard to the influence and results
18549: of his reasoning.
18550: 
18551: But, it will be said, must we not warn the youth entrusted to
18552: academical care against such writings, must we not preserve them from
18553: the knowledge of these dangerous assertions, until their judgement is
18554: ripened, or rather until the doctrines which we wish to inculcate are
18555: so firmly rooted in their minds as to withstand all attempts at
18556: instilling the contrary dogmas, from whatever quarter they may come?
18557: 
18558: If we are to confine ourselves to the dogmatical procedure in the
18559: sphere of pure reason, and find ourselves unable to settle such
18560: disputes otherwise than by becoming a party in them, and setting
18561: counter-assertions against the statements advanced by our opponents,
18562: there is certainly no plan more advisable for the moment, but, at the
18563: same time, none more absurd and inefficient for the future, than this
18564: retaining of the youthful mind under guardianship for a time, and thus
18565: preserving it—for so long at least—from seduction into error. But when,
18566: at a later period, either curiosity, or the prevalent fashion of
18567: thought places such writings in their hands, will the so-called
18568: convictions of their youth stand firm? The young thinker, who has in
18569: his armoury none but dogmatical weapons with which to resist the
18570: attacks of his opponent, and who cannot detect the latent dialectic
18571: which lies in his own opinions as well as in those of the opposite
18572: party, sees the advance of illusory arguments and grounds of proof
18573: which have the advantage of novelty, against as illusory grounds of
18574: proof destitute of this advantage, and which, perhaps, excite the
18575: suspicion that the natural credulity of his youth has been abused by
18576: his instructors. He thinks he can find no better means of showing that
18577: he has out grown the discipline of his minority than by despising those
18578: well-meant warnings, and, knowing no system of thought but that of
18579: dogmatism, he drinks deep draughts of the poison that is to sap the
18580: principles in which his early years were trained.
18581: 
18582: Exactly the opposite of the system here recommended ought to be pursued
18583: in academical instruction. This can only be effected, however, by a
18584: thorough training in the critical investigation of pure reason. For, in
18585: order to bring the principles of this critique into exercise as soon as
18586: possible, and to demonstrate their perfect even in the presence of the
18587: highest degree of dialectical illusion, the student ought to examine
18588: the assertions made on both sides of speculative questions step by
18589: step, and to test them by these principles. It cannot be a difficult
18590: task for him to show the fallacies inherent in these propositions, and
18591: thus he begins early to feel his own power of securing himself against
18592: the influence of such sophistical arguments, which must finally lose,
18593: for him, all their illusory power. And, although the same blows which
18594: overturn the edifice of his opponent are as fatal to his own
18595: speculative structures, if such he has wished to rear; he need not feel
18596: any sorrow in regard to this seeming misfortune, as he has now before
18597: him a fair prospect into the practical region in which he may
18598: reasonably hope to find a more secure foundation for a rational system.
18599: 
18600: There is, accordingly, no proper polemic in the sphere of pure reason.
18601: Both parties beat the air and fight with their own shadows, as they
18602: pass beyond the limits of nature, and can find no tangible point of
18603: attack—no firm footing for their dogmatical conflict. Fight as
18604: vigorously as they may, the shadows which they hew down, immediately
18605: start up again, like the heroes in Walhalla, and renew the bloodless
18606: and unceasing contest.
18607: 
18608: But neither can we admit that there is any proper sceptical employment
18609: of pure reason, such as might be based upon the principle of neutrality
18610: in all speculative disputes. To excite reason against itself, to place
18611: weapons in the hands of the party on the one side as well as in those
18612: of the other, and to remain an undisturbed and sarcastic spectator of
18613: the fierce struggle that ensues, seems, from the dogmatical point of
18614: view, to be a part fitting only a malevolent disposition. But, when the
18615: sophist evidences an invincible obstinacy and blindness, and a pride
18616: which no criticism can moderate, there is no other practicable course
18617: than to oppose to this pride and obstinacy similar feelings and
18618: pretensions on the other side, equally well or ill founded, so that
18619: reason, staggered by the reflections thus forced upon it, finds it
18620: necessary to moderate its confidence in such pretensions and to listen
18621: to the advice of criticism. But we cannot stop at these doubts, much
18622: less regard the conviction of our ignorance, not only as a cure for the
18623: conceit natural to dogmatism, but as the settlement of the disputes in
18624: which reason is involved with itself. On the contrary, scepticism is
18625: merely a means of awakening reason from its dogmatic dreams and
18626: exciting it to a more careful investigation into its own powers and
18627: pretensions. But, as scepticism appears to be the shortest road to a
18628: permanent peace in the domain of philosophy, and as it is the track
18629: pursued by the many who aim at giving a philosophical colouring to
18630: their contemptuous dislike of all inquiries of this kind, I think it
18631: necessary to present to my readers this mode of thought in its true
18632: light.
18633: 
18634: _Scepticism not a Permanent State for Human Reason._
18635: 
18636: The consciousness of ignorance—unless this ignorance is recognized to
18637: be absolutely necessary ought, instead of forming the conclusion of my
18638: inquiries, to be the strongest motive to the pursuit of them. All
18639: ignorance is either ignorance of things or of the limits of knowledge.
18640: If my ignorance is accidental and not necessary, it must incite me, in
18641: the first case, to a dogmatical inquiry regarding the objects of which
18642: I am ignorant; in the second, to a critical investigation into the
18643: bounds of all possible knowledge. But that my ignorance is absolutely
18644: necessary and unavoidable, and that it consequently absolves from the
18645: duty of all further investigation, is a fact which cannot be made out
18646: upon empirical grounds—from observation—but upon critical grounds
18647: alone, that is, by a thoroughgoing investigation into the primary
18648: sources of cognition. It follows that the determination of the bounds
18649: of reason can be made only on à priori grounds; while the empirical
18650: limitation of reason, which is merely an indeterminate cognition of an
18651: ignorance that can never be completely removed, can take place only à
18652: posteriori. In other words, our empirical knowledge is limited by that
18653: which yet remains for us to know. The former cognition of our
18654: ignorance, which is possible only on a rational basis, is a science;
18655: the latter is merely a perception, and we cannot say how far the
18656: inferences drawn from it may extend. If I regard the earth, as it
18657: really appears to my senses, as a flat surface, I am ignorant how far
18658: this surface extends. But experience teaches me that, how far soever I
18659: go, I always see before me a space in which I can proceed farther; and
18660: thus I know the limits—merely visual—of my actual knowledge of the
18661: earth, although I am ignorant of the limits of the earth itself. But if
18662: I have got so far as to know that the earth is a sphere, and that its
18663: surface is spherical, I can cognize à priori and determine upon
18664: principles, from my knowledge of a small part of this surface—say to
18665: the extent of a degree—the diameter and circumference of the earth; and
18666: although I am ignorant of the objects which this surface contains, I
18667: have a perfect knowledge of its limits and extent.
18668: 
18669: The sum of all the possible objects of our cognition seems to us to be
18670: a level surface, with an apparent horizon—that which forms the limit of
18671: its extent, and which has been termed by us the idea of unconditioned
18672: totality. To reach this limit by empirical means is impossible, and all
18673: attempts to determine it à priori according to a principle, are alike
18674: in vain. But all the questions raised by pure reason relate to that
18675: which lies beyond this horizon, or, at least, in its boundary line.
18676: 
18677: The celebrated David Hume was one of those geographers of human reason
18678: who believe that they have given a sufficient answer to all such
18679: questions by declaring them to lie beyond the horizon of our
18680: knowledge—a horizon which, however, Hume was unable to determine. His
18681: attention especially was directed to the principle of causality; and he
18682: remarked with perfect justice that the truth of this principle, and
18683: even the objective validity of the conception of a cause, was not
18684: commonly based upon clear insight, that is, upon à priori cognition.
18685: Hence he concluded that this law does not derive its authority from its
18686: universality and necessity, but merely from its general applicability
18687: in the course of experience, and a kind of subjective necessity thence
18688: arising, which he termed habit. From the inability of reason to
18689: establish this principle as a necessary law for the acquisition of all
18690: experience, he inferred the nullity of all the attempts of reason to
18691: pass the region of the empirical.
18692: 
18693: This procedure of subjecting the facta of reason to examination, and,
18694: if necessary, to disapproval, may be termed the censura of reason. This
18695: censura must inevitably lead us to doubts regarding all transcendent
18696: employment of principles. But this is only the second step in our
18697: inquiry. The first step in regard to the subjects of pure reason, and
18698: which marks the infancy of that faculty, is that of dogmatism. The
18699: second, which we have just mentioned, is that of scepticism, and it
18700: gives evidence that our judgement has been improved by experience. But
18701: a third step is necessary—indicative of the maturity and manhood of the
18702: judgement, which now lays a firm foundation upon universal and
18703: necessary principles. This is the period of criticism, in which we do
18704: not examine the facta of reason, but reason itself, in the whole extent
18705: of its powers, and in regard to its capability of à priori cognition;
18706: and thus we determine not merely the empirical and ever-shifting bounds
18707: of our knowledge, but its necessary and eternal limits. We demonstrate
18708: from indubitable principles, not merely our ignorance in respect to
18709: this or that subject, but in regard to all possible questions of a
18710: certain class. Thus scepticism is a resting place for reason, in which
18711: it may reflect on its dogmatical wanderings and gain some knowledge of
18712: the region in which it happens to be, that it may pursue its way with
18713: greater certainty; but it cannot be its permanent dwelling-place. It
18714: must take up its abode only in the region of complete certitude,
18715: whether this relates to the cognition of objects themselves, or to the
18716: limits which bound all our cognition.
18717: 
18718: Reason is not to be considered as an indefinitely extended plane, of
18719: the bounds of which we have only a general knowledge; it ought rather
18720: to be compared to a sphere, the radius of which may be found from the
18721: curvature of its surface—that is, the nature of à priori synthetical
18722: propositions—and, consequently, its circumference and extent. Beyond
18723: the sphere of experience there are no objects which it can cognize;
18724: nay, even questions regarding such supposititious objects relate only
18725: to the subjective principles of a complete determination of the
18726: relations which exist between the understanding-conceptions which lie
18727: within this sphere.
18728: 
18729: We are actually in possession of à priori synthetical cognitions, as is
18730: proved by the existence of the principles of the understanding, which
18731: anticipate experience. If any one cannot comprehend the possibility of
18732: these principles, he may have some reason to doubt whether they are
18733: really à priori; but he cannot on this account declare them to be
18734: impossible, and affirm the nullity of the steps which reason may have
18735: taken under their guidance. He can only say: If we perceived their
18736: origin and their authenticity, we should be able to determine the
18737: extent and limits of reason; but, till we can do this, all propositions
18738: regarding the latter are mere random assertions. In this view, the
18739: doubt respecting all dogmatical philosophy, which proceeds without the
18740: guidance of criticism, is well grounded; but we cannot therefore deny
18741: to reason the ability to construct a sound philosophy, when the way has
18742: been prepared by a thorough critical investigation. All the conceptions
18743: produced, and all the questions raised, by pure reason, do not lie in
18744: the sphere of experience, but in that of reason itself, and hence they
18745: must be solved, and shown to be either valid or inadmissible, by that
18746: faculty. We have no right to decline the solution of such problems, on
18747: the ground that the solution can be discovered only from the nature of
18748: things, and under pretence of the limitation of human faculties, for
18749: reason is the sole creator of all these ideas, and is therefore bound
18750: either to establish their validity or to expose their illusory nature.
18751: 
18752: The polemic of scepticism is properly directed against the dogmatist,
18753: who erects a system of philosophy without having examined the
18754: fundamental objective principles on which it is based, for the purpose
18755: of evidencing the futility of his designs, and thus bringing him to a
18756: knowledge of his own powers. But, in itself, scepticism does not give
18757: us any certain information in regard to the bounds of our knowledge.
18758: All unsuccessful dogmatical attempts of reason are facia, which it is
18759: always useful to submit to the censure of the sceptic. But this cannot
18760: help us to any decision regarding the expectations which reason
18761: cherishes of better success in future endeavours; the investigations of
18762: scepticism cannot, therefore, settle the dispute regarding the rights
18763: and powers of human reason.
18764: 
18765: Hume is perhaps the ablest and most ingenious of all sceptical
18766: philosophers, and his writings have, undoubtedly, exerted the most
18767: powerful influence in awakening reason to a thorough investigation into
18768: its own powers. It will, therefore, well repay our labours to consider
18769: for a little the course of reasoning which he followed and the errors
18770: into which he strayed, although setting out on the path of truth and
18771: certitude.
18772: 
18773: Hume was probably aware, although he never clearly developed the
18774: notion, that we proceed in judgements of a certain class beyond our
18775: conception of the object. I have termed this kind of judgement
18776: synthetical. As regard the manner in which I pass beyond my conception
18777: by the aid of experience, no doubts can be entertained. Experience is
18778: itself a synthesis of perceptions; and it employs perceptions to
18779: increment the conception, which I obtain by means of another
18780: perception. But we feel persuaded that we are able to proceed beyond a
18781: conception, and to extend our cognition à priori. We attempt this in
18782: two ways—either, through the pure understanding, in relation to that
18783: which may become an object of experience, or, through pure reason, in
18784: relation to such properties of things, or of the existence of things,
18785: as can never be presented in any experience. This sceptical philosopher
18786: did not distinguish these two kinds of judgements, as he ought to have
18787: done, but regarded this augmentation of conceptions, and, if we may so
18788: express ourselves, the spontaneous generation of understanding and
18789: reason, independently of the impregnation of experience, as altogether
18790: impossible. The so-called à priori principles of these faculties he
18791: consequently held to be invalid and imaginary, and regarded them as
18792: nothing but subjective habits of thought originating in experience, and
18793: therefore purely empirical and contingent rules, to which we attribute
18794: a spurious necessity and universality. In support of this strange
18795: assertion, he referred us to the generally acknowledged principle of
18796: the relation between cause and effect. No faculty of the mind can
18797: conduct us from the conception of a thing to the existence of something
18798: else; and hence he believed he could infer that, without experience, we
18799: possess no source from which we can augment a conception, and no ground
18800: sufficient to justify us in framing a judgement that is to extend our
18801: cognition à priori. That the light of the sun, which shines upon a
18802: piece of wax, at the same time melts it, while it hardens clay, no
18803: power of the understanding could infer from the conceptions which we
18804: previously possessed of these substances; much less is there any à
18805: priori law that could conduct us to such a conclusion, which experience
18806: alone can certify. On the other hand, we have seen in our discussion of
18807: transcendental logic, that, although we can never proceed immediately
18808: beyond the content of the conception which is given us, we can always
18809: cognize completely à priori—in relation, however, to a third term,
18810: namely, possible experience—the law of its connection with other
18811: things. For example, if I observe that a piece of wax melts, I can
18812: cognize à priori that there must have been something (the sun’s heat)
18813: preceding, which this law; although, without the aid of experience, I
18814: could not cognize à priori and in a determinate manner either the cause
18815: from the effect, or the effect from the cause. Hume was, therefore,
18816: wrong in inferring, from the contingency of the determination according
18817: to law, the contingency of the law itself; and the passing beyond the
18818: conception of a thing to possible experience (which is an à priori
18819: proceeding, constituting the objective reality of the conception), he
18820: confounded with our synthesis of objects in actual experience, which is
18821: always, of course, empirical. Thus, too, he regarded the principle of
18822: affinity, which has its seat in the understanding and indicates a
18823: necessary connection, as a mere rule of association, lying in the
18824: imitative faculty of imagination, which can present only contingent,
18825: and not objective connections.
18826: 
18827: The sceptical errors of this remarkably acute thinker arose principally
18828: from a defect, which was common to him with the dogmatists, namely,
18829: that he had never made a systematic review of all the different kinds
18830: of à priori synthesis performed by the understanding. Had he done so,
18831: he would have found, to take one example among many, that the principle
18832: of permanence was of this character, and that it, as well as the
18833: principle of causality, anticipates experience. In this way he might
18834: have been able to describe the determinate limits of the à priori
18835: operations of understanding and reason. But he merely declared the
18836: understanding to be limited, instead of showing what its limits were;
18837: he created a general mistrust in the power of our faculties, without
18838: giving us any determinate knowledge of the bounds of our necessary and
18839: unavoidable ignorance; he examined and condemned some of the principles
18840: of the understanding, without investigating all its powers with the
18841: completeness necessary to criticism. He denies, with truth, certain
18842: powers to the understanding, but he goes further, and declares it to be
18843: utterly inadequate to the à priori extension of knowledge, although he
18844: has not fully examined all the powers which reside in the faculty; and
18845: thus the fate which always overtakes scepticism meets him too. That is
18846: to say, his own declarations are doubted, for his objections were based
18847: upon facta, which are contingent, and not upon principles, which can
18848: alone demonstrate the necessary invalidity of all dogmatical
18849: assertions.
18850: 
18851: As Hume makes no distinction between the well-grounded claims of the
18852: understanding and the dialectical pretensions of reason, against which,
18853: however, his attacks are mainly directed, reason does not feel itself
18854: shut out from all attempts at the extension of à priori cognition, and
18855: hence it refuses, in spite of a few checks in this or that quarter, to
18856: relinquish such efforts. For one naturally arms oneself to resist an
18857: attack, and becomes more obstinate in the resolve to establish the
18858: claims he has advanced. But a complete review of the powers of reason,
18859: and the conviction thence arising that we are in possession of a
18860: limited field of action, while we must admit the vanity of higher
18861: claims, puts an end to all doubt and dispute, and induces reason to
18862: rest satisfied with the undisturbed possession of its limited domain.
18863: 
18864: To the uncritical dogmatist, who has not surveyed the sphere of his
18865: understanding, nor determined, in accordance with principles, the
18866: limits of possible cognition, who, consequently, is ignorant of his own
18867: powers, and believes he will discover them by the attempts he makes in
18868: the field of cognition, these attacks of scepticism are not only
18869: dangerous, but destructive. For if there is one proposition in his
18870: chain of reasoning which he cannot prove, or the fallacy in which he
18871: cannot evolve in accordance with a principle, suspicion falls on all
18872: his statements, however plausible they may appear.
18873: 
18874: And thus scepticism, the bane of dogmatical philosophy, conducts us to
18875: a sound investigation into the understanding and the reason. When we
18876: are thus far advanced, we need fear no further attacks; for the limits
18877: of our domain are clearly marked out, and we can make no claims nor
18878: become involved in any disputes regarding the region that lies beyond
18879: these limits. Thus the sceptical procedure in philosophy does not
18880: present any solution of the problems of reason, but it forms an
18881: excellent exercise for its powers, awakening its circumspection, and
18882: indicating the means whereby it may most fully establish its claims to
18883: its legitimate possessions.
18884: 
18885: Section III. The Discipline of Pure Reason in Hypothesis
18886: 
18887: This critique of reason has now taught us that all its efforts to
18888: extend the bounds of knowledge, by means of pure speculation, are
18889: utterly fruitless. So much the wider field, it may appear, lies open to
18890: hypothesis; as, where we cannot know with certainty, we are at liberty
18891: to make guesses and to form suppositions.
18892: 
18893: Imagination may be allowed, under the strict surveillance of reason, to
18894: invent suppositions; but, these must be based on something that is
18895: perfectly certain—and that is the possibility of the object. If we are
18896: well assured upon this point, it is allowable to have recourse to
18897: supposition in regard to the reality of the object; but this
18898: supposition must, unless it is utterly groundless, be connected, as its
18899: ground of explanation, with that which is really given and absolutely
18900: certain. Such a supposition is termed a hypothesis.
18901: 
18902: It is beyond our power to form the least conception à priori of the
18903: possibility of dynamical connection in phenomena; and the category of
18904: the pure understanding will not enable us to excogitate any such
18905: connection, but merely helps us to understand it, when we meet with it
18906: in experience. For this reason we cannot, in accordance with the
18907: categories, imagine or invent any object or any property of an object
18908: not given, or that may not be given in experience, and employ it in a
18909: hypothesis; otherwise, we should be basing our chain of reasoning upon
18910: mere chimerical fancies, and not upon conceptions of things. Thus, we
18911: have no right to assume the existence of new powers, not existing in
18912: nature—for example, an understanding with a non-sensuous intuition, a
18913: force of attraction without contact, or some new kind of substances
18914: occupying space, and yet without the property of impenetrability—and,
18915: consequently, we cannot assume that there is any other kind of
18916: community among substances than that observable in experience, any kind
18917: of presence than that in space, or any kind of duration than that in
18918: time. In one word, the conditions of possible experience are for reason
18919: the only conditions of the possibility of things; reason cannot venture
18920: to form, independently of these conditions, any conceptions of things,
18921: because such conceptions, although not self-contradictory, are without
18922: object and without application.
18923: 
18924: The conceptions of reason are, as we have already shown, mere ideas,
18925: and do not relate to any object in any kind of experience. At the same
18926: time, they do not indicate imaginary or possible objects. They are
18927: purely problematical in their nature and, as aids to the heuristic
18928: exercise of the faculties, form the basis of the regulative principles
18929: for the systematic employment of the understanding in the field of
18930: experience. If we leave this ground of experience, they become mere
18931: fictions of thought, the possibility of which is quite indemonstrable;
18932: and they cannot, consequently, be employed as hypotheses in the
18933: explanation of real phenomena. It is quite admissible to cogitate the
18934: soul as simple, for the purpose of enabling ourselves to employ the
18935: idea of a perfect and necessary unity of all the faculties of the mind
18936: as the principle of all our inquiries into its internal phenomena,
18937: although we cannot cognize this unity in concreto. But to assume that
18938: the soul is a simple substance (a transcendental conception) would be
18939: enouncing a proposition which is not only indemonstrable—as many
18940: physical hypotheses are—but a proposition which is purely arbitrary,
18941: and in the highest degree rash. The simple is never presented in
18942: experience; and, if by substance is here meant the permanent object of
18943: sensuous intuition, the possibility of a simple phenomenon is perfectly
18944: inconceivable. Reason affords no good grounds for admitting the
18945: existence of intelligible beings, or of intelligible properties of
18946: sensuous things, although—as we have no conception either of their
18947: possibility or of their impossibility—it will always be out of our
18948: power to affirm dogmatically that they do not exist. In the explanation
18949: of given phenomena, no other things and no other grounds of explanation
18950: can be employed than those which stand in connection with the given
18951: phenomena according to the known laws of experience. A transcendental
18952: hypothesis, in which a mere idea of reason is employed to explain the
18953: phenomena of nature, would not give us any better insight into a
18954: phenomenon, as we should be trying to explain what we do not
18955: sufficiently understand from known empirical principles, by what we do
18956: not understand at all. The principles of such a hypothesis might
18957: conduce to the satisfaction of reason, but it would not assist the
18958: understanding in its application to objects. Order and conformity to
18959: aims in the sphere of nature must be themselves explained upon natural
18960: grounds and according to natural laws; and the wildest hypotheses, if
18961: they are only physical, are here more admissible than a hyperphysical
18962: hypothesis, such as that of a divine author. For such a hypothesis
18963: would introduce the principle of ignava ratio, which requires us to
18964: give up the search for causes that might be discovered in the course of
18965: experience and to rest satisfied with a mere idea. As regards the
18966: absolute totality of the grounds of explanation in the series of these
18967: causes, this can be no hindrance to the understanding in the case of
18968: phenomena; because, as they are to us nothing more than phenomena, we
18969: have no right to look for anything like completeness in the synthesis
18970: of the series of their conditions.
18971: 
18972: Transcendental hypotheses are therefore inadmissible; and we cannot use
18973: the liberty of employing, in the absence of physical, hyperphysical
18974: grounds of explanation. And this for two reasons; first, because such
18975: hypothesis do not advance reason, but rather stop it in its progress;
18976: secondly, because this licence would render fruitless all its exertions
18977: in its own proper sphere, which is that of experience. For, when the
18978: explanation of natural phenomena happens to be difficult, we have
18979: constantly at hand a transcendental ground of explanation, which lifts
18980: us above the necessity of investigating nature; and our inquiries are
18981: brought to a close, not because we have obtained all the requisite
18982: knowledge, but because we abut upon a principle which is
18983: incomprehensible and which, indeed, is so far back in the track of
18984: thought as to contain the conception of the absolutely primal being.
18985: 
18986: The next requisite for the admissibility of a hypothesis is its
18987: sufficiency. That is, it must determine à priori the consequences which
18988: are given in experience and which are supposed to follow from the
18989: hypothesis itself. If we require to employ auxiliary hypotheses, the
18990: suspicion naturally arises that they are mere fictions; because the
18991: necessity for each of them requires the same justification as in the
18992: case of the original hypothesis, and thus their testimony is invalid.
18993: If we suppose the existence of an infinitely perfect cause, we possess
18994: sufficient grounds for the explanation of the conformity to aims, the
18995: order and the greatness which we observe in the universe; but we find
18996: ourselves obliged, when we observe the evil in the world and the
18997: exceptions to these laws, to employ new hypothesis in support of the
18998: original one. We employ the idea of the simple nature of the human soul
18999: as the foundation of all the theories we may form of its phenomena; but
19000: when we meet with difficulties in our way, when we observe in the soul
19001: phenomena similar to the changes which take place in matter, we require
19002: to call in new auxiliary hypotheses. These may, indeed, not be false,
19003: but we do not know them to be true, because the only witness to their
19004: certitude is the hypothesis which they themselves have been called in
19005: to explain.
19006: 
19007: We are not discussing the above-mentioned assertions regarding the
19008: immaterial unity of the soul and the existence of a Supreme Being as
19009: dogmata, which certain philosophers profess to demonstrate à priori,
19010: but purely as hypotheses. In the former case, the dogmatist must take
19011: care that his arguments possess the apodeictic certainty of a
19012: demonstration. For the assertion that the reality of such ideas is
19013: probable is as absurd as a proof of the probability of a proposition in
19014: geometry. Pure abstract reason, apart from all experience, can either
19015: cognize nothing at all; and hence the judgements it enounces are never
19016: mere opinions, they are either apodeictic certainties, or declarations
19017: that nothing can be known on the subject. Opinions and probable
19018: judgements on the nature of things can only be employed to explain
19019: given phenomena, or they may relate to the effect, in accordance with
19020: empirical laws, of an actually existing cause. In other words, we must
19021: restrict the sphere of opinion to the world of experience and nature.
19022: Beyond this region opinion is mere invention; unless we are groping
19023: about for the truth on a path not yet fully known, and have some hopes
19024: of stumbling upon it by chance.
19025: 
19026: But, although hypotheses are inadmissible in answers to the questions
19027: of pure speculative reason, they may be employed in the defence of
19028: these answers. That is to say, hypotheses are admissible in polemic,
19029: but not in the sphere of dogmatism. By the defence of statements of
19030: this character, I do not mean an attempt at discovering new grounds for
19031: their support, but merely the refutation of the arguments of opponents.
19032: All à priori synthetical propositions possess the peculiarity that,
19033: although the philosopher who maintains the reality of the ideas
19034: contained in the proposition is not in possession of sufficient
19035: knowledge to establish the certainty of his statements, his opponent is
19036: as little able to prove the truth of the opposite. This equality of
19037: fortune does not allow the one party to be superior to the other in the
19038: sphere of speculative cognition; and it is this sphere, accordingly,
19039: that is the proper arena of these endless speculative conflicts. But we
19040: shall afterwards show that, in relation to its practical exercise,
19041: Reason has the right of admitting what, in the field of pure
19042: speculation, she would not be justified in supposing, except upon
19043: perfectly sufficient grounds; because all such suppositions destroy the
19044: necessary completeness of speculation—a condition which the practical
19045: reason, however, does not consider to be requisite. In this sphere,
19046: therefore, Reason is mistress of a possession, her title to which she
19047: does not require to prove—which, in fact, she could not do. The burden
19048: of proof accordingly rests upon the opponent. But as he has just as
19049: little knowledge regarding the subject discussed, and is as little able
19050: to prove the non-existence of the object of an idea, as the philosopher
19051: on the other side is to demonstrate its reality, it is evident that
19052: there is an advantage on the side of the philosopher who maintains his
19053: proposition as a practically necessary supposition (melior est conditio
19054: possidentis). For he is at liberty to employ, in self-defence, the same
19055: weapons as his opponent makes use of in attacking him; that is, he has
19056: a right to use hypotheses not for the purpose of supporting the
19057: arguments in favour of his own propositions, but to show that his
19058: opponent knows no more than himself regarding the subject under
19059: discussion and cannot boast of any speculative advantage.
19060: 
19061: Hypotheses are, therefore, admissible in the sphere of pure reason only
19062: as weapons for self-defence, and not as supports to dogmatical
19063: assertions. But the opposing party we must always seek for in
19064: ourselves. For speculative reason is, in the sphere of
19065: transcendentalism, dialectical in its own nature. The difficulties and
19066: objections we have to fear lie in ourselves. They are like old but
19067: never superannuated claims; and we must seek them out, and settle them
19068: once and for ever, if we are to expect a permanent peace. External
19069: tranquility is hollow and unreal. The root of these contradictions,
19070: which lies in the nature of human reason, must be destroyed; and this
19071: can only be done by giving it, in the first instance, freedom to grow,
19072: nay, by nourishing it, that it may send out shoots, and thus betray its
19073: own existence. It is our duty, therefore, to try to discover new
19074: objections, to put weapons in the bands of our opponent, and to grant
19075: him the most favourable position in the arena that he can wish. We have
19076: nothing to fear from these concessions; on the contrary, we may rather
19077: hope that we shall thus make ourselves master of a possession which no
19078: one will ever venture to dispute.
19079: 
19080: The thinker requires, to be fully equipped, the hypotheses of pure
19081: reason, which, although but leaden weapons (for they have not been
19082: steeled in the armoury of experience), are as useful as any that can be
19083: employed by his opponents. If, accordingly, we have assumed, from a
19084: non-speculative point of view, the immaterial nature of the soul, and
19085: are met by the objection that experience seems to prove that the growth
19086: and decay of our mental faculties are mere modifications of the
19087: sensuous organism—we can weaken the force of this objection by the
19088: assumption that the body is nothing but the fundamental phenomenon, to
19089: which, as a necessary condition, all sensibility, and consequently all
19090: thought, relates in the present state of our existence; and that the
19091: separation of soul and body forms the conclusion of the sensuous
19092: exercise of our power of cognition and the beginning of the
19093: intellectual. The body would, in this view of the question, be
19094: regarded, not as the cause of thought, but merely as its restrictive
19095: condition, as promotive of the sensuous and animal, but as a hindrance
19096: to the pure and spiritual life; and the dependence of the animal life
19097: on the constitution of the body, would not prove that the whole life of
19098: man was also dependent on the state of the organism. We might go still
19099: farther, and discover new objections, or carry out to their extreme
19100: consequences those which have already been adduced.
19101: 
19102: Generation, in the human race as well as among the irrational animals,
19103: depends on so many accidents—of occasion, of proper sustenance, of the
19104: laws enacted by the government of a country of vice even, that it is
19105: difficult to believe in the eternal existence of a being whose life has
19106: begun under circumstances so mean and trivial, and so entirely
19107: dependent upon our own control. As regards the continuance of the
19108: existence of the whole race, we need have no difficulties, for accident
19109: in single cases is subject to general laws; but, in the case of each
19110: individual, it would seem as if we could hardly expect so wonderful an
19111: effect from causes so insignificant. But, in answer to these
19112: objections, we may adduce the transcendental hypothesis that all life
19113: is properly intelligible, and not subject to changes of time, and that
19114: it neither began in birth, nor will end in death. We may assume that
19115: this life is nothing more than a sensuous representation of pure
19116: spiritual life; that the whole world of sense is but an image, hovering
19117: before the faculty of cognition which we exercise in this sphere, and
19118: with no more objective reality than a dream; and that if we could
19119: intuite ourselves and other things as they really are, we should see
19120: ourselves in a world of spiritual natures, our connection with which
19121: did not begin at our birth and will not cease with the destruction of
19122: the body. And so on.
19123: 
19124: We cannot be said to know what has been above asserted, nor do we
19125: seriously maintain the truth of these assertions; and the notions
19126: therein indicated are not even ideas of reason, they are purely
19127: fictitious conceptions. But this hypothetical procedure is in perfect
19128: conformity with the laws of reason. Our opponent mistakes the absence
19129: of empirical conditions for a proof of the complete impossibility of
19130: all that we have asserted; and we have to show him that he has not
19131: exhausted the whole sphere of possibility and that he can as little
19132: compass that sphere by the laws of experience and nature, as we can lay
19133: a secure foundation for the operations of reason beyond the region of
19134: experience. Such hypothetical defences against the pretensions of an
19135: opponent must not be regarded as declarations of opinion. The
19136: philosopher abandons them, so soon as the opposite party renounces its
19137: dogmatical conceit. To maintain a simply negative position in relation
19138: to propositions which rest on an insecure foundation, well befits the
19139: moderation of a true philosopher; but to uphold the objections urged
19140: against an opponent as proofs of the opposite statement is a proceeding
19141: just as unwarrantable and arrogant as it is to attack the position of a
19142: philosopher who advances affirmative propositions regarding such a
19143: subject.
19144: 
19145: It is evident, therefore, that hypotheses, in the speculative sphere,
19146: are valid, not as independent propositions, but only relatively to
19147: opposite transcendent assumptions. For, to make the principles of
19148: possible experience conditions of the possibility of things in general
19149: is just as transcendent a procedure as to maintain the objective
19150: reality of ideas which can be applied to no objects except such as lie
19151: without the limits of possible experience. The judgements enounced by
19152: pure reason must be necessary, or they must not be enounced at all.
19153: Reason cannot trouble herself with opinions. But the hypotheses we have
19154: been discussing are merely problematical judgements, which can neither
19155: be confuted nor proved; while, therefore, they are not personal
19156: opinions, they are indispensable as answers to objections which are
19157: liable to be raised. But we must take care to confine them to this
19158: function, and guard against any assumption on their part of absolute
19159: validity, a proceeding which would involve reason in inextricable
19160: difficulties and contradictions.
19161: 
19162: Section IV. The Discipline of Pure Reason in Relation to Proofs
19163: 
19164: It is a peculiarity, which distinguishes the proofs of transcendental
19165: synthetical propositions from those of all other à priori synthetical
19166: cognitions, that reason, in the case of the former, does not apply its
19167: conceptions directly to an object, but is first obliged to prove, à
19168: priori, the objective validity of these conceptions and the possibility
19169: of their syntheses. This is not merely a prudential rule, it is
19170: essential to the very possibility of the proof of a transcendental
19171: proposition. If I am required to pass, à priori, beyond the conception
19172: of an object, I find that it is utterly impossible without the guidance
19173: of something which is not contained in the conception. In mathematics,
19174: it is à priori intuition that guides my synthesis; and, in this case,
19175: all our conclusions may be drawn immediately from pure intuition. In
19176: transcendental cognition, so long as we are dealing only with
19177: conceptions of the understanding, we are guided by possible experience.
19178: That is to say, a proof in the sphere of transcendental cognition does
19179: not show that the given conception (that of an event, for example)
19180: leads directly to another conception (that of a cause)—for this would
19181: be a saltus which nothing can justify; but it shows that experience
19182: itself, and consequently the object of experience, is impossible
19183: without the connection indicated by these conceptions. It follows that
19184: such a proof must demonstrate the possibility of arriving,
19185: synthetically and à priori, at a certain knowledge of things, which was
19186: not contained in our conceptions of these things. Unless we pay
19187: particular attention to this requirement, our proofs, instead of
19188: pursuing the straight path indicated by reason, follow the tortuous
19189: road of mere subjective association. The illusory conviction, which
19190: rests upon subjective causes of association, and which is considered as
19191: resulting from the perception of a real and objective natural affinity,
19192: is always open to doubt and suspicion. For this reason, all the
19193: attempts which have been made to prove the principle of sufficient
19194: reason, have, according to the universal admission of philosophers,
19195: been quite unsuccessful; and, before the appearance of transcendental
19196: criticism, it was considered better, as this principle could not be
19197: abandoned, to appeal boldly to the common sense of mankind (a
19198: proceeding which always proves that the problem, which reason ought to
19199: solve, is one in which philosophers find great difficulties), rather
19200: than attempt to discover new dogmatical proofs.
19201: 
19202: But, if the proposition to be proved is a proposition of pure reason,
19203: and if I aim at passing beyond my empirical conceptions by the aid of
19204: mere ideas, it is necessary that the proof should first show that such
19205: a step in synthesis is possible (which it is not), before it proceeds
19206: to prove the truth of the proposition itself. The so-called proof of
19207: the simple nature of the soul from the unity of apperception, is a very
19208: plausible one. But it contains no answer to the objection, that, as the
19209: notion of absolute simplicity is not a conception which is directly
19210: applicable to a perception, but is an idea which must be inferred—if at
19211: all—from observation, it is by no means evident how the mere fact of
19212: consciousness, which is contained in all thought, although in so far a
19213: simple representation, can conduct me to the consciousness and
19214: cognition of a thing which is purely a thinking substance. When I
19215: represent to my mind the power of my body as in motion, my body in this
19216: thought is so far absolute unity, and my representation of it is a
19217: simple one; and hence I can indicate this representation by the motion
19218: of a point, because I have made abstraction of the size or volume of
19219: the body. But I cannot hence infer that, given merely the moving power
19220: of a body, the body may be cogitated as simple substance, merely
19221: because the representation in my mind takes no account of its content
19222: in space, and is consequently simple. The simple, in abstraction, is
19223: very different from the objectively simple; and hence the Ego, which is
19224: simple in the first sense, may, in the second sense, as indicating the
19225: soul itself, be a very complex conception, with a very various content.
19226: Thus it is evident that in all such arguments there lurks a paralogism.
19227: We guess (for without some such surmise our suspicion would not be
19228: excited in reference to a proof of this character) at the presence of
19229: the paralogism, by keeping ever before us a criterion of the
19230: possibility of those synthetical propositions which aim at proving more
19231: than experience can teach us. This criterion is obtained from the
19232: observation that such proofs do not lead us directly from the subject
19233: of the proposition to be proved to the required predicate, but find it
19234: necessary to presuppose the possibility of extending our cognition à
19235: priori by means of ideas. We must, accordingly, always use the greatest
19236: caution; we require, before attempting any proof, to consider how it is
19237: possible to extend the sphere of cognition by the operations of pure
19238: reason, and from what source we are to derive knowledge, which is not
19239: obtained from the analysis of conceptions, nor relates, by
19240: anticipation, to possible experience. We shall thus spare ourselves
19241: much severe and fruitless labour, by not expecting from reason what is
19242: beyond its power, or rather by subjecting it to discipline, and
19243: teaching it to moderate its vehement desires for the extension of the
19244: sphere of cognition.
19245: 
19246: The first rule for our guidance is, therefore, not to attempt a
19247: transcendental proof, before we have considered from what source we are
19248: to derive the principles upon which the proof is to be based, and what
19249: right we have to expect that our conclusions from these principles will
19250: be veracious. If they are principles of the understanding, it is vain
19251: to expect that we should attain by their means to ideas of pure reason;
19252: for these principles are valid only in regard to objects of possible
19253: experience. If they are principles of pure reason, our labour is alike
19254: in vain. For the principles of reason, if employed as objective, are
19255: without exception dialectical and possess no validity or truth, except
19256: as regulative principles of the systematic employment of reason in
19257: experience. But when such delusive proof are presented to us, it is our
19258: duty to meet them with the non liquet of a matured judgement; and,
19259: although we are unable to expose the particular sophism upon which the
19260: proof is based, we have a right to demand a deduction of the principles
19261: employed in it; and, if these principles have their origin in pure
19262: reason alone, such a deduction is absolutely impossible. And thus it is
19263: unnecessary that we should trouble ourselves with the exposure and
19264: confutation of every sophistical illusion; we may, at once, bring all
19265: dialectic, which is inexhaustible in the production of fallacies,
19266: before the bar of critical reason, which tests the principles upon
19267: which all dialectical procedure is based. The second peculiarity of
19268: transcendental proof is that a transcendental proposition cannot rest
19269: upon more than a single proof. If I am drawing conclusions, not from
19270: conceptions, but from intuition corresponding to a conception, be it
19271: pure intuition, as in mathematics, or empirical, as in natural science,
19272: the intuition which forms the basis of my inferences presents me with
19273: materials for many synthetical propositions, which I can connect in
19274: various modes, while, as it is allowable to proceed from different
19275: points in the intention, I can arrive by different paths at the same
19276: proposition.
19277: 
19278: But every transcendental proposition sets out from a conception, and
19279: posits the synthetical condition of the possibility of an object
19280: according to this conception. There must, therefore, be but one ground
19281: of proof, because it is the conception alone which determines the
19282: object; and thus the proof cannot contain anything more than the
19283: determination of the object according to the conception. In our
19284: Transcendental Analytic, for example, we inferred the principle: Every
19285: event has a cause, from the only condition of the objective possibility
19286: of our conception of an event. This is that an event cannot be
19287: determined in time, and consequently cannot form a part of experience,
19288: unless it stands under this dynamical law. This is the only possible
19289: ground of proof; for our conception of an event possesses objective
19290: validity, that is, is a true conception, only because the law of
19291: causality determines an object to which it can refer. Other arguments
19292: in support of this principle have been attempted—such as that from the
19293: contingent nature of a phenomenon; but when this argument is
19294: considered, we can discover no criterion of contingency, except the
19295: fact of an event—of something happening, that is to say, the existence
19296: which is preceded by the non-existence of an object, and thus we fall
19297: back on the very thing to be proved. If the proposition: “Every
19298: thinking being is simple,” is to be proved, we keep to the conception
19299: of the ego, which is simple, and to which all thought has a relation.
19300: The same is the case with the transcendental proof of the existence of
19301: a Deity, which is based solely upon the harmony and reciprocal fitness
19302: of the conceptions of an ens realissimum and a necessary being, and
19303: cannot be attempted in any other manner.
19304: 
19305: This caution serves to simplify very much the criticism of all
19306: propositions of reason. When reason employs conceptions alone, only one
19307: proof of its thesis is possible, if any. When, therefore, the dogmatist
19308: advances with ten arguments in favour of a proposition, we may be sure
19309: that not one of them is conclusive. For if he possessed one which
19310: proved the proposition he brings forward to demonstration—as must
19311: always be the case with the propositions of pure reason—what need is
19312: there for any more? His intention can only be similar to that of the
19313: advocate who had different arguments for different judges; this
19314: availing himself of the weakness of those who examine his arguments,
19315: who, without going into any profound investigation, adopt the view of
19316: the case which seems most probable at first sight and decide according
19317: to it.
19318: 
19319: The third rule for the guidance of pure reason in the conduct of a
19320: proof is that all transcendental proofs must never be apagogic or
19321: indirect, but always ostensive or direct. The direct or ostensive proof
19322: not only establishes the truth of the proposition to be proved, but
19323: exposes the grounds of its truth; the apagogic, on the other hand, may
19324: assure us of the truth of the proposition, but it cannot enable us to
19325: comprehend the grounds of its possibility. The latter is, accordingly,
19326: rather an auxiliary to an argument, than a strictly philosophical and
19327: rational mode of procedure. In one respect, however, they have an
19328: advantage over direct proofs, from the fact that the mode of arguing by
19329: contradiction, which they employ, renders our understanding of the
19330: question more clear, and approximates the proof to the certainty of an
19331: intuitional demonstration.
19332: 
19333: The true reason why indirect proofs are employed in different sciences
19334: is this. When the grounds upon which we seek to base a cognition are
19335: too various or too profound, we try whether or not we may not discover
19336: the truth of our cognition from its consequences. The modus ponens of
19337: reasoning from the truth of its inferences to the truth of a
19338: proposition would be admissible if all the inferences that can be drawn
19339: from it are known to be true; for in this case there can be only one
19340: possible ground for these inferences, and that is the true one. But
19341: this is a quite impracticable procedure, as it surpasses all our powers
19342: to discover all the possible inferences that can be drawn from a
19343: proposition. But this mode of reasoning is employed, under favour, when
19344: we wish to prove the truth of an hypothesis; in which case we admit the
19345: truth of the conclusion—which is supported by analogy—that, if all the
19346: inferences we have drawn and examined agree with the proposition
19347: assumed, all other possible inferences will also agree with it. But, in
19348: this way, an hypothesis can never be established as a demonstrated
19349: truth. The modus tollens of reasoning from known inferences to the
19350: unknown proposition, is not only a rigorous, but a very easy mode of
19351: proof. For, if it can be shown that but one inference from a
19352: proposition is false, then the proposition must itself be false.
19353: Instead, then, of examining, in an ostensive argument, the whole series
19354: of the grounds on which the truth of a proposition rests, we need only
19355: take the opposite of this proposition, and if one inference from it be
19356: false, then must the opposite be itself false; and, consequently, the
19357: proposition which we wished to prove must be true.
19358: 
19359: The apagogic method of proof is admissible only in those sciences where
19360: it is impossible to mistake a subjective representation for an
19361: objective cognition. Where this is possible, it is plain that the
19362: opposite of a given proposition may contradict merely the subjective
19363: conditions of thought, and not the objective cognition; or it may
19364: happen that both propositions contradict each other only under a
19365: subjective condition, which is incorrectly considered to be objective,
19366: and, as the condition is itself false, both propositions may be false,
19367: and it will, consequently, be impossible to conclude the truth of the
19368: one from the falseness of the other.
19369: 
19370: In mathematics such subreptions are impossible; and it is in this
19371: science, accordingly, that the indirect mode of proof has its true
19372: place. In the science of nature, where all assertion is based upon
19373: empirical intuition, such subreptions may be guarded against by the
19374: repeated comparison of observations; but this mode of proof is of
19375: little value in this sphere of knowledge. But the transcendental
19376: efforts of pure reason are all made in the sphere of the subjective,
19377: which is the real medium of all dialectical illusion; and thus reason
19378: endeavours, in its premisses, to impose upon us subjective
19379: representations for objective cognitions. In the transcendental sphere
19380: of pure reason, then, and in the case of synthetical propositions, it
19381: is inadmissible to support a statement by disproving the
19382: counter-statement. For only two cases are possible; either, the
19383: counter-statement is nothing but the enouncement of the inconsistency
19384: of the opposite opinion with the subjective conditions of reason, which
19385: does not affect the real case (for example, we cannot comprehend the
19386: unconditioned necessity of the existence of a being, and hence every
19387: speculative proof of the existence of such a being must be opposed on
19388: subjective grounds, while the possibility of this being in itself
19389: cannot with justice be denied); or, both propositions, being
19390: dialectical in their nature, are based upon an impossible conception.
19391: In this latter case the rule applies: non entis nulla sunt predicata;
19392: that is to say, what we affirm and what we deny, respecting such an
19393: object, are equally untrue, and the apagogic mode of arriving at the
19394: truth is in this case impossible. If, for example, we presuppose that
19395: the world of sense is given in itself in its totality, it is false,
19396: either that it is infinite, or that it is finite and limited in space.
19397: Both are false, because the hypothesis is false. For the notion of
19398: phenomena (as mere representations) which are given in themselves (as
19399: objects) is self-contradictory; and the infinitude of this imaginary
19400: whole would, indeed, be unconditioned, but would be inconsistent (as
19401: everything in the phenomenal world is conditioned) with the
19402: unconditioned determination and finitude of quantities which is
19403: presupposed in our conception.
19404: 
19405: The apagogic mode of proof is the true source of those illusions which
19406: have always had so strong an attraction for the admirers of dogmatical
19407: philosophy. It may be compared to a champion who maintains the honour
19408: and claims of the party he has adopted by offering battle to all who
19409: doubt the validity of these claims and the purity of that honour; while
19410: nothing can be proved in this way, except the respective strength of
19411: the combatants, and the advantage, in this respect, is always on the
19412: side of the attacking party. Spectators, observing that each party is
19413: alternately conqueror and conquered, are led to regard the subject of
19414: dispute as beyond the power of man to decide upon. But such an opinion
19415: cannot be justified; and it is sufficient to apply to these reasoners
19416: the remark:
19417: 
19418: _Non defensoribus istis
19419: Tempus eget._
19420: 
19421: 
19422: Each must try to establish his assertions by a transcendental deduction
19423: of the grounds of proof employed in his argument, and thus enable us to
19424: see in what way the claims of reason may be supported. If an opponent
19425: bases his assertions upon subjective grounds, he may be refuted with
19426: ease; not, however to the advantage of the dogmatist, who likewise
19427: depends upon subjective sources of cognition and is in like manner
19428: driven into a corner by his opponent. But, if parties employ the direct
19429: method of procedure, they will soon discover the difficulty, nay, the
19430: impossibility of proving their assertions, and will be forced to appeal
19431: to prescription and precedence; or they will, by the help of criticism,
19432: discover with ease the dogmatical illusions by which they had been
19433: mocked, and compel reason to renounce its exaggerated pretensions to
19434: speculative insight and to confine itself within the limits of its
19435: proper sphere—that of practical principles.
19436: 
19437: Chapter II. The Canon of Pure Reason
19438: 
19439: It is a humiliating consideration for human reason that it is
19440: incompetent to discover truth by means of pure speculation, but, on the
19441: contrary, stands in need of discipline to check its deviations from the
19442: straight path and to expose the illusions which it originates. But, on
19443: the other hand, this consideration ought to elevate and to give it
19444: confidence, for this discipline is exercised by itself alone, and it is
19445: subject to the censure of no other power. The bounds, moreover, which
19446: it is forced to set to its speculative exercise, form likewise a check
19447: upon the fallacious pretensions of opponents; and thus what remains of
19448: its possessions, after these exaggerated claims have been disallowed,
19449: is secure from attack or usurpation. The greatest, and perhaps the
19450: only, use of all philosophy of pure reason is, accordingly, of a purely
19451: negative character. It is not an organon for the extension, but a
19452: discipline for the determination, of the limits of its exercise; and
19453: without laying claim to the discovery of new truth, it has the modest
19454: merit of guarding against error.
19455: 
19456: At the same time, there must be some source of positive cognitions
19457: which belong to the domain of pure reason and which become the causes
19458: of error only from our mistaking their true character, while they form
19459: the goal towards which reason continually strives. How else can we
19460: account for the inextinguishable desire in the human mind to find a
19461: firm footing in some region beyond the limits of the world of
19462: experience? It hopes to attain to the possession of a knowledge in
19463: which it has the deepest interest. It enters upon the path of pure
19464: speculation; but in vain. We have some reason, however, to expect that,
19465: in the only other way that lies open to it—the path of practical
19466: reason—it may meet with better success.
19467: 
19468: I understand by a canon a list of the à priori principles of the proper
19469: employment of certain faculties of cognition. Thus general logic, in
19470: its analytical department, is a formal canon for the faculties of
19471: understanding and reason. In the same way, Transcendental Analytic was
19472: seen to be a canon of the pure understanding; for it alone is competent
19473: to enounce true à priori synthetical cognitions. But, when no proper
19474: employment of a faculty of cognition is possible, no canon can exist.
19475: But the synthetical cognition of pure speculative reason is, as has
19476: been shown, completely impossible. There cannot, therefore, exist any
19477: canon for the speculative exercise of this faculty—for its speculative
19478: exercise is entirely dialectical; and, consequently, transcendental
19479: logic, in this respect, is merely a discipline, and not a canon. If,
19480: then, there is any proper mode of employing the faculty of pure
19481: reason—in which case there must be a canon for this faculty—this canon
19482: will relate, not to the speculative, but to the practical use of
19483: reason. This canon we now proceed to investigate.
19484: 
19485: Section I. Of the Ultimate End of the Pure Use of Reason
19486: 
19487: There exists in the faculty of reason a natural desire to venture
19488: beyond the field of experience, to attempt to reach the utmost bounds
19489: of all cognition by the help of ideas alone, and not to rest satisfied
19490: until it has fulfilled its course and raised the sum of its cognitions
19491: into a self-subsistent systematic whole. Is the motive for this
19492: endeavour to be found in its speculative, or in its practical interests
19493: alone?
19494: 
19495: Setting aside, at present, the results of the labours of pure reason in
19496: its speculative exercise, I shall merely inquire regarding the problems
19497: the solution of which forms its ultimate aim, whether reached or not,
19498: and in relation to which all other aims are but partial and
19499: intermediate. These highest aims must, from the nature of reason,
19500: possess complete unity; otherwise the highest interest of humanity
19501: could not be successfully promoted.
19502: 
19503: The transcendental speculation of reason relates to three things: the
19504: freedom of the will, the immortality of the soul, and the existence of
19505: God. The speculative interest which reason has in those questions is
19506: very small; and, for its sake alone, we should not undertake the labour
19507: of transcendental investigation—a labour full of toil and ceaseless
19508: struggle. We should be loth to undertake this labour, because the
19509: discoveries we might make would not be of the smallest use in the
19510: sphere of concrete or physical investigation. We may find out that the
19511: will is free, but this knowledge only relates to the intelligible cause
19512: of our volition. As regards the phenomena or expressions of this will,
19513: that is, our actions, we are bound, in obedience to an inviolable
19514: maxim, without which reason cannot be employed in the sphere of
19515: experience, to explain these in the same way as we explain all the
19516: other phenomena of nature, that is to say, according to its
19517: unchangeable laws. We may have discovered the spirituality and
19518: immortality of the soul, but we cannot employ this knowledge to explain
19519: the phenomena of this life, nor the peculiar nature of the future,
19520: because our conception of an incorporeal nature is purely negative and
19521: does not add anything to our knowledge, and the only inferences to be
19522: drawn from it are purely fictitious. If, again, we prove the existence
19523: of a supreme intelligence, we should be able from it to make the
19524: conformity to aims existing in the arrangement of the world
19525: comprehensible; but we should not be justified in deducing from it any
19526: particular arrangement or disposition, or inferring any where it is not
19527: perceived. For it is a necessary rule of the speculative use of reason
19528: that we must not overlook natural causes, or refuse to listen to the
19529: teaching of experience, for the sake of deducing what we know and
19530: perceive from something that transcends all our knowledge. In one word,
19531: these three propositions are, for the speculative reason, always
19532: transcendent, and cannot be employed as immanent principles in relation
19533: to the objects of experience; they are, consequently, of no use to us
19534: in this sphere, being but the valueless results of the severe but
19535: unprofitable efforts of reason.
19536: 
19537: If, then, the actual cognition of these three cardinal propositions is
19538: perfectly useless, while Reason uses her utmost endeavours to induce us
19539: to admit them, it is plain that their real value and importance relate
19540: to our practical, and not to our speculative interest.
19541: 
19542: I term all that is possible through free will, practical. But if the
19543: conditions of the exercise of free volition are empirical, reason can
19544: have only a regulative, and not a constitutive, influence upon it, and
19545: is serviceable merely for the introduction of unity into its empirical
19546: laws. In the moral philosophy of prudence, for example, the sole
19547: business of reason is to bring about a union of all the ends, which are
19548: aimed at by our inclinations, into one ultimate end—that of
19549: happiness—and to show the agreement which should exist among the means
19550: of attaining that end. In this sphere, accordingly, reason cannot
19551: present to us any other than pragmatical laws of free action, for our
19552: guidance towards the aims set up by the senses, and is incompetent to
19553: give us laws which are pure and determined completely à priori. On the
19554: other hand, pure practical laws, the ends of which have been given by
19555: reason entirely à priori, and which are not empirically conditioned,
19556: but are, on the contrary, absolutely imperative in their nature, would
19557: be products of pure reason. Such are the moral laws; and these alone
19558: belong to the sphere of the practical exercise of reason, and admit of
19559: a canon.
19560: 
19561: All the powers of reason, in the sphere of what may be termed pure
19562: philosophy, are, in fact, directed to the three above-mentioned
19563: problems alone. These again have a still higher end—the answer to the
19564: question, what we ought to do, if the will is free, if there is a God
19565: and a future world. Now, as this problem relates to our in reference to
19566: the highest aim of humanity, it is evident that the ultimate intention
19567: of nature, in the constitution of our reason, has been directed to the
19568: moral alone.
19569: 
19570: We must take care, however, in turning our attention to an object which
19571: is foreign[78] to the sphere of transcendental philosophy, not to
19572: injure the unity of our system by digressions, nor, on the other hand,
19573: to fail in clearness, by saying too little on the new subject of
19574: discussion. I hope to avoid both extremes, by keeping as close as
19575: possible to the transcendental, and excluding all psychological, that
19576: is, empirical, elements.
19577: 
19578:  [78] All practical conceptions relate to objects of pleasure and pain,
19579:  and consequently—in an indirect manner, at least—to objects of
19580:  feeling. But as feeling is not a faculty of representation, but lies
19581:  out of the sphere of our powers of cognition, the elements of our
19582:  judgements, in so far as they relate to pleasure or pain, that is, the
19583:  elements of our practical judgements, do not belong to transcendental
19584:  philosophy, which has to do with pure à priori cognitions alone.
19585: 
19586: 
19587: I have to remark, in the first place, that at present I treat of the
19588: conception of freedom in the practical sense only, and set aside the
19589: corresponding transcendental conception, which cannot be employed as a
19590: ground of explanation in the phenomenal world, but is itself a problem
19591: for pure reason. A will is purely animal (arbitrium brutum) when it is
19592: determined by sensuous impulses or instincts only, that is, when it is
19593: determined in a pathological manner. A will, which can be determined
19594: independently of sensuous impulses, consequently by motives presented
19595: by reason alone, is called a free will (arbitrium liberum); and
19596: everything which is connected with this free will, either as principle
19597: or consequence, is termed practical. The existence of practical freedom
19598: can be proved from experience alone. For the human will is not
19599: determined by that alone which immediately affects the senses; on the
19600: contrary, we have the power, by calling up the notion of what is useful
19601: or hurtful in a more distant relation, of overcoming the immediate
19602: impressions on our sensuous faculty of desire. But these considerations
19603: of what is desirable in relation to our whole state, that is, is in the
19604: end good and useful, are based entirely upon reason. This faculty,
19605: accordingly, enounces laws, which are imperative or objective laws of
19606: freedom and which tell us what ought to take place, thus distinguishing
19607: themselves from the laws of nature, which relate to that which does
19608: take place. The laws of freedom or of free will are hence termed
19609: practical laws.
19610: 
19611: Whether reason is not itself, in the actual delivery of these laws,
19612: determined in its turn by other influences, and whether the action
19613: which, in relation to sensuous impulses, we call free, may not, in
19614: relation to higher and more remote operative causes, really form a part
19615: of nature—these are questions which do not here concern us. They are
19616: purely speculative questions; and all we have to do, in the practical
19617: sphere, is to inquire into the rule of conduct which reason has to
19618: present. Experience demonstrates to us the existence of practical
19619: freedom as one of the causes which exist in nature, that is, it shows
19620: the causal power of reason in the determination of the will. The idea
19621: of transcendental freedom, on the contrary, requires that reason—in
19622: relation to its causal power of commencing a series of phenomena—should
19623: be independent of all sensuous determining causes; and thus it seems to
19624: be in opposition to the law of nature and to all possible experience.
19625: It therefore remains a problem for the human mind. But this problem
19626: does not concern reason in its practical use; and we have, therefore,
19627: in a canon of pure reason, to do with only two questions, which relate
19628: to the practical interest of pure reason: Is there a God? and, Is there
19629: a future life? The question of transcendental freedom is purely
19630: speculative, and we may therefore set it entirely aside when we come to
19631: treat of practical reason. Besides, we have already discussed this
19632: subject in the antinomy of pure reason.
19633: 
19634: Section II. Of the Ideal of the Summum Bonum as a Determining Ground of
19635: the Ultimate End of Pure Reason
19636: 
19637: Reason conducted us, in its speculative use, through the field of
19638: experience and, as it can never find complete satisfaction in that
19639: sphere, from thence to speculative ideas—which, however, in the end
19640: brought us back again to experience, and thus fulfilled the purpose of
19641: reason, in a manner which, though useful, was not at all in accordance
19642: with our expectations. It now remains for us to consider whether pure
19643: reason can be employed in a practical sphere, and whether it will here
19644: conduct us to those ideas which attain the highest ends of pure reason,
19645: as we have just stated them. We shall thus ascertain whether, from the
19646: point of view of its practical interest, reason may not be able to
19647: supply us with that which, on the speculative side, it wholly denies
19648: us.
19649: 
19650: The whole interest of reason, speculative as well as practical, is
19651: centred in the three following questions:
19652: 
19653: 1. WHAT CAN I KNOW?
19654: 2. WHAT OUGHT I TO DO?
19655: 3. WHAT MAY I HOPE?
19656: 
19657: 
19658: The first question is purely speculative. We have, as I flatter myself,
19659: exhausted all the replies of which it is susceptible, and have at last
19660: found the reply with which reason must content itself, and with which
19661: it ought to be content, so long as it pays no regard to the practical.
19662: But from the two great ends to the attainment of which all these
19663: efforts of pure reason were in fact directed, we remain just as far
19664: removed as if we had consulted our ease and declined the task at the
19665: outset. So far, then, as knowledge is concerned, thus much, at least,
19666: is established, that, in regard to those two problems, it lies beyond
19667: our reach.
19668: 
19669: The second question is purely practical. As such it may indeed fall
19670: within the province of pure reason, but still it is not transcendental,
19671: but moral, and consequently cannot in itself form the subject of our
19672: criticism.
19673: 
19674: The third question: If I act as I ought to do, what may I then hope?—is
19675: at once practical and theoretical. The practical forms a clue to the
19676: answer of the theoretical, and—in its highest form—speculative
19677: question. For all hoping has happiness for its object and stands in
19678: precisely the same relation to the practical and the law of morality as
19679: knowing to the theoretical cognition of things and the law of nature.
19680: The former arrives finally at the conclusion that something is (which
19681: determines the ultimate end), because something ought to take place;
19682: the latter, that something is (which operates as the highest cause),
19683: because something does take place.
19684: 
19685: Happiness is the satisfaction of all our desires; extensive, in regard
19686: to their multiplicity; intensive, in regard to their degree; and
19687: protensive, in regard to their duration. The practical law based on the
19688: motive of happiness I term a pragmatical law (or prudential rule); but
19689: that law, assuming such to exist, which has no other motive than the
19690: worthiness of being happy, I term a moral or ethical law. The first
19691: tells us what we have to do, if we wish to become possessed of
19692: happiness; the second dictates how we ought to act, in order to deserve
19693: happiness. The first is based upon empirical principles; for it is only
19694: by experience that I can learn either what inclinations exist which
19695: desire satisfaction, or what are the natural means of satisfying them.
19696: The second takes no account of our desires or the means of satisfying
19697: them, and regards only the freedom of a rational being, and the
19698: necessary conditions under which alone this freedom can harmonize with
19699: the distribution of happiness according to principles. This second law
19700: may therefore rest upon mere ideas of pure reason, and may be cognized
19701: à priori.
19702: 
19703: I assume that there are pure moral laws which determine, entirely à
19704: priori (without regard to empirical motives, that is, to happiness),
19705: the conduct of a rational being, or in other words, to use which it
19706: makes of its freedom, and that these laws are absolutely imperative
19707: (not merely hypothetically, on the supposition of other empirical
19708: ends), and therefore in all respects necessary. I am warranted in
19709: assuming this, not only by the arguments of the most enlightened
19710: moralists, but by the moral judgement of every man who will make the
19711: attempt to form a distinct conception of such a law.
19712: 
19713: Pure reason, then, contains, not indeed in its speculative, but in its
19714: practical, or, more strictly, its moral use, principles of the
19715: possibility of experience, of such actions, namely, as, in accordance
19716: with ethical precepts, might be met with in the history of man. For
19717: since reason commands that such actions should take place, it must be
19718: possible for them to take place; and hence a particular kind of
19719: systematic unity—the moral—must be possible. We have found, it is true,
19720: that the systematic unity of nature could not be established according
19721: to speculative principles of reason, because, while reason possesses a
19722: causal power in relation to freedom, it has none in relation to the
19723: whole sphere of nature; and, while moral principles of reason can
19724: produce free actions, they cannot produce natural laws. It is, then, in
19725: its practical, but especially in its moral use, that the principles of
19726: pure reason possess objective reality.
19727: 
19728: I call the world a moral world, in so far as it may be in accordance
19729: with all the ethical laws—which, by virtue of the freedom of reasonable
19730: beings, it can be, and according to the necessary laws of morality it
19731: ought to be. But this world must be conceived only as an intelligible
19732: world, inasmuch as abstraction is therein made of all conditions
19733: (ends), and even of all impediments to morality (the weakness or
19734: pravity of human nature). So far, then, it is a mere idea—though still
19735: a practical idea—which may have, and ought to have, an influence on the
19736: world of sense, so as to bring it as far as possible into conformity
19737: with itself. The idea of a moral world has, therefore, objective
19738: reality, not as referring to an object of intelligible intuition—for of
19739: such an object we can form no conception whatever—but to the world of
19740: sense—conceived, however, as an object of pure reason in its practical
19741: use—and to a corpus mysticum of rational beings in it, in so far as the
19742: liberum arbitrium of the individual is placed, under and by virtue of
19743: moral laws, in complete systematic unity both with itself and with the
19744: freedom of all others.
19745: 
19746: That is the answer to the first of the two questions of pure reason
19747: which relate to its practical interest: Do that which will render thee
19748: worthy of happiness. The second question is this: If I conduct myself
19749: so as not to be unworthy of happiness, may I hope thereby to obtain
19750: happiness? In order to arrive at the solution of this question, we must
19751: inquire whether the principles of pure reason, which prescribe à priori
19752: the law, necessarily also connect this hope with it.
19753: 
19754: I say, then, that just as the moral principles are necessary according
19755: to reason in its practical use, so it is equally necessary according to
19756: reason in its theoretical use to assume that every one has ground to
19757: hope for happiness in the measure in which he has made himself worthy
19758: of it in his conduct, and that therefore the system of morality is
19759: inseparably (though only in the idea of pure reason) connected with
19760: that of happiness.
19761: 
19762: Now in an intelligible, that is, in the moral world, in the conception
19763: of which we make abstraction of all the impediments to morality
19764: (sensuous desires), such a system of happiness, connected with and
19765: proportioned to morality, may be conceived as necessary, because
19766: freedom of volition—partly incited, and partly restrained by moral
19767: laws—would be itself the cause of general happiness; and thus rational
19768: beings, under the guidance of such principles, would be themselves the
19769: authors both of their own enduring welfare and that of others. But such
19770: a system of self-rewarding morality is only an idea, the carrying out
19771: of which depends upon the condition that every one acts as he ought; in
19772: other words, that all actions of reasonable beings be such as they
19773: would be if they sprung from a Supreme Will, comprehending in, or
19774: under, itself all particular wills. But since the moral law is binding
19775: on each individual in the use of his freedom of volition, even if
19776: others should not act in conformity with this law, neither the nature
19777: of things, nor the causality of actions and their relation to morality,
19778: determine how the consequences of these actions will be related to
19779: happiness; and the necessary connection of the hope of happiness with
19780: the unceasing endeavour to become worthy of happiness, cannot be
19781: cognized by reason, if we take nature alone for our guide. This
19782: connection can be hoped for only on the assumption that the cause of
19783: nature is a supreme reason, which governs according to moral laws.
19784: 
19785: I term the idea of an intelligence in which the morally most perfect
19786: will, united with supreme blessedness, is the cause of all happiness in
19787: the world, so far as happiness stands in strict relation to morality
19788: (as the worthiness of being happy), the ideal of the supreme Good. It
19789: is only, then, in the ideal of the supreme original good, that pure
19790: reason can find the ground of the practically necessary connection of
19791: both elements of the highest derivative good, and accordingly of an
19792: intelligible, that is, moral world. Now since we are necessitated by
19793: reason to conceive ourselves as belonging to such a world, while the
19794: senses present to us nothing but a world of phenomena, we must assume
19795: the former as a consequence of our conduct in the world of sense (since
19796: the world of sense gives us no hint of it), and therefore as future in
19797: relation to us. Thus God and a future life are two hypotheses which,
19798: according to the principles of pure reason, are inseparable from the
19799: obligation which this reason imposes upon us.
19800: 
19801: Morality per se constitutes a system. But we can form no system of
19802: happiness, except in so far as it is dispensed in strict proportion to
19803: morality. But this is only possible in the intelligible world, under a
19804: wise author and ruler. Such a ruler, together with life in such a
19805: world, which we must look upon as future, reason finds itself compelled
19806: to assume; or it must regard the moral laws as idle dreams, since the
19807: necessary consequence which this same reason connects with them must,
19808: without this hypothesis, fall to the ground. Hence also the moral laws
19809: are universally regarded as commands, which they could not be did they
19810: not connect à priori adequate consequences with their dictates, and
19811: thus carry with them promises and threats. But this, again, they could
19812: not do, did they not reside in a necessary being, as the Supreme Good,
19813: which alone can render such a teleological unity possible.
19814: 
19815: Leibnitz termed the world, when viewed in relation to the rational
19816: beings which it contains, and the moral relations in which they stand
19817: to each other, under the government of the Supreme Good, the kingdom of
19818: Grace, and distinguished it from the kingdom of Nature, in which these
19819: rational beings live, under moral laws, indeed, but expect no other
19820: consequences from their actions than such as follow according to the
19821: course of nature in the world of sense. To view ourselves, therefore,
19822: as in the kingdom of grace, in which all happiness awaits us, except in
19823: so far as we ourselves limit our participation in it by actions which
19824: render us unworthy of happiness, is a practically necessary idea of
19825: reason.
19826: 
19827: Practical laws, in so far as they are subjective grounds of actions,
19828: that is, subjective principles, are termed maxims. The judgements of
19829: moral according to in its purity and ultimate results are framed
19830: according ideas; the observance of its laws, according to maxims.
19831: 
19832: The whole course of our life must be subject to moral maxims; but this
19833: is impossible, unless with the moral law, which is a mere idea, reason
19834: connects an efficient cause which ordains to all conduct which is in
19835: conformity with the moral law an issue either in this or in another
19836: life, which is in exact conformity with our highest aims. Thus, without
19837: a God and without a world, invisible to us now, but hoped for, the
19838: glorious ideas of morality are, indeed, objects of approbation and of
19839: admiration, but cannot be the springs of purpose and action. For they
19840: do not satisfy all the aims which are natural to every rational being,
19841: and which are determined à priori by pure reason itself, and necessary.
19842: 
19843: Happiness alone is, in the view of reason, far from being the complete
19844: good. Reason does not approve of it (however much inclination may
19845: desire it), except as united with desert. On the other hand, morality
19846: alone, and with it, mere desert, is likewise far from being the
19847: complete good. To make it complete, he who conducts himself in a manner
19848: not unworthy of happiness, must be able to hope for the possession of
19849: happiness. Even reason, unbiased by private ends, or interested
19850: considerations, cannot judge otherwise, if it puts itself in the place
19851: of a being whose business it is to dispense all happiness to others.
19852: For in the practical idea both points are essentially combined, though
19853: in such a way that participation in happiness is rendered possible by
19854: the moral disposition, as its condition, and not conversely, the moral
19855: disposition by the prospect of happiness. For a disposition which
19856: should require the prospect of happiness as its necessary condition
19857: would not be moral, and hence also would not be worthy of complete
19858: happiness—a happiness which, in the view of reason, recognizes no
19859: limitation but such as arises from our own immoral conduct.
19860: 
19861: Happiness, therefore, in exact proportion with the morality of rational
19862: beings (whereby they are made worthy of happiness), constitutes alone
19863: the supreme good of a world into which we absolutely must transport
19864: ourselves according to the commands of pure but practical reason. This
19865: world is, it is true, only an intelligible world; for of such a
19866: systematic unity of ends as it requires, the world of sense gives us no
19867: hint. Its reality can be based on nothing else but the hypothesis of a
19868: supreme original good. In it independent reason, equipped with all the
19869: sufficiency of a supreme cause, founds, maintains, and fulfils the
19870: universal order of things, with the most perfect teleological harmony,
19871: however much this order may be hidden from us in the world of sense.
19872: 
19873: This moral theology has the peculiar advantage, in contrast with
19874: speculative theology, of leading inevitably to the conception of a
19875: sole, perfect, and rational First Cause, whereof speculative theology
19876: does not give us any indication on objective grounds, far less any
19877: convincing evidence. For we find neither in transcendental nor in
19878: natural theology, however far reason may lead us in these, any ground
19879: to warrant us in assuming the existence of one only Being, which stands
19880: at the head of all natural causes, and on which these are entirely
19881: dependent. On the other hand, if we take our stand on moral unity as a
19882: necessary law of the universe, and from this point of view consider
19883: what is necessary to give this law adequate efficiency and, for us,
19884: obligatory force, we must come to the conclusion that there is one only
19885: supreme will, which comprehends all these laws in itself. For how,
19886: under different wills, should we find complete unity of ends? This will
19887: must be omnipotent, that all nature and its relation to morality in the
19888: world may be subject to it; omniscient, that it may have knowledge of
19889: the most secret feelings and their moral worth; omnipresent, that it
19890: may be at hand to supply every necessity to which the highest weal of
19891: the world may give rise; eternal, that this harmony of nature and
19892: liberty may never fail; and so on.
19893: 
19894: But this systematic unity of ends in this world of intelligences—which,
19895: as mere nature, is only a world of sense, but, as a system of freedom
19896: of volition, may be termed an intelligible, that is, moral world
19897: (regnum gratiae)—leads inevitably also to the teleological unity of all
19898: things which constitute this great whole, according to universal
19899: natural laws—just as the unity of the former is according to universal
19900: and necessary moral laws—and unites the practical with the speculative
19901: reason. The world must be represented as having originated from an
19902: idea, if it is to harmonize with that use of reason without which we
19903: cannot even consider ourselves as worthy of reason—namely, the moral
19904: use, which rests entirely on the idea of the supreme good. Hence the
19905: investigation of nature receives a teleological direction, and becomes,
19906: in its widest extension, physico-theology. But this, taking its rise in
19907: moral order as a unity founded on the essence of freedom, and not
19908: accidentally instituted by external commands, establishes the
19909: teleological view of nature on grounds which must be inseparably
19910: connected with the internal possibility of things. This gives rise to a
19911: transcendental theology, which takes the ideal of the highest
19912: ontological perfection as a principle of systematic unity; and this
19913: principle connects all things according to universal and necessary
19914: natural laws, because all things have their origin in the absolute
19915: necessity of the one only Primal Being.
19916: 
19917: What use can we make of our understanding, even in respect of
19918: experience, if we do not propose ends to ourselves? But the highest
19919: ends are those of morality, and it is only pure reason that can give us
19920: the knowledge of these. Though supplied with these, and putting
19921: ourselves under their guidance, we can make no teleological use of the
19922: knowledge of nature, as regards cognition, unless nature itself has
19923: established teleological unity. For without this unity we should not
19924: even possess reason, because we should have no school for reason, and
19925: no cultivation through objects which afford the materials for its
19926: conceptions. But teleological unity is a necessary unity, and founded
19927: on the essence of the individual will itself. Hence this will, which is
19928: the condition of the application of this unity in concreto, must be so
19929: likewise. In this way the transcendental enlargement of our rational
19930: cognition would be, not the cause, but merely the effect of the
19931: practical teleology which pure reason imposes upon us.
19932: 
19933: Hence, also, we find in the history of human reason that, before the
19934: moral conceptions were sufficiently purified and determined, and before
19935: men had attained to a perception of the systematic unity of ends
19936: according to these conceptions and from necessary principles, the
19937: knowledge of nature, and even a considerable amount of intellectual
19938: culture in many other sciences, could produce only rude and vague
19939: conceptions of the Deity, sometimes even admitting of an astonishing
19940: indifference with regard to this question altogether. But the more
19941: enlarged treatment of moral ideas, which was rendered necessary by the
19942: extreme pure moral law of our religion, awakened the interest, and
19943: thereby quickened the perceptions of reason in relation to this object.
19944: In this way, and without the help either of an extended acquaintance
19945: with nature, or of a reliable transcendental insight (for these have
19946: been wanting in all ages), a conception of the Divine Being was arrived
19947: at, which we now hold to be the correct one, not because speculative
19948: reason convinces us of its correctness, but because it accords with the
19949: moral principles of reason. Thus it is to pure reason, but only in its
19950: practical use, that we must ascribe the merit of having connected with
19951: our highest interest a cognition, of which mere speculation was able
19952: only to form a conjecture, but the validity of which it was unable to
19953: establish—and of having thereby rendered it, not indeed a demonstrated
19954: dogma, but a hypothesis absolutely necessary to the essential ends of
19955: reason.
19956: 
19957: But if practical reason has reached this elevation, and has attained to
19958: the conception of a sole Primal Being as the supreme good, it must not,
19959: therefore, imagine that it has transcended the empirical conditions of
19960: its application, and risen to the immediate cognition of new objects;
19961: it must not presume to start from the conception which it has gained,
19962: and to deduce from it the moral laws themselves. For it was these very
19963: laws, the internal practical necessity of which led us to the
19964: hypothesis of an independent cause, or of a wise ruler of the universe,
19965: who should give them effect. Hence we are not entitled to regard them
19966: as accidental and derived from the mere will of the ruler, especially
19967: as we have no conception of such a will, except as formed in accordance
19968: with these laws. So far, then, as practical reason has the right to
19969: conduct us, we shall not look upon actions as binding on us, because
19970: they are the commands of God, but we shall regard them as divine
19971: commands, because we are internally bound by them. We shall study
19972: freedom under the teleological unity which accords with principles of
19973: reason; we shall look upon ourselves as acting in conformity with the
19974: divine will only in so far as we hold sacred the moral law which reason
19975: teaches us from the nature of actions themselves, and we shall believe
19976: that we can obey that will only by promoting the weal of the universe
19977: in ourselves and in others. Moral theology is, therefore, only of
19978: immanent use. It teaches us to fulfil our destiny here in the world, by
19979: placing ourselves in harmony with the general system of ends, and warns
19980: us against the fanaticism, nay, the crime of depriving reason of its
19981: legislative authority in the moral conduct of life, for the purpose of
19982: directly connecting this authority with the idea of the Supreme Being.
19983: For this would be, not an immanent, but a transcendent use of moral
19984: theology, and, like the transcendent use of mere speculation, would
19985: inevitably pervert and frustrate the ultimate ends of reason.
19986: 
19987: Section III. Of Opinion, Knowledge, and Belief
19988: 
19989: The holding of a thing to be true is a phenomenon in our understanding
19990: which may rest on objective grounds, but requires, also, subjective
19991: causes in the mind of the person judging. If a judgement is valid for
19992: every rational being, then its ground is objectively sufficient, and it
19993: is termed a conviction. If, on the other hand, it has its ground in the
19994: particular character of the subject, it is termed a persuasion.
19995: 
19996: Persuasion is a mere illusion, the ground of the judgement, which lies
19997: solely in the subject, being regarded as objective. Hence a judgement
19998: of this kind has only private validity—is only valid for the individual
19999: who judges, and the holding of a thing to be true in this way cannot be
20000: communicated. But truth depends upon agreement with the object, and
20001: consequently the judgements of all understandings, if true, must be in
20002: agreement with each other (consentientia uni tertio consentiunt inter
20003: se). Conviction may, therefore, be distinguished, from an external
20004: point of view, from persuasion, by the possibility of communicating it
20005: and by showing its validity for the reason of every man; for in this
20006: case the presumption, at least, arises that the agreement of all
20007: judgements with each other, in spite of the different characters of
20008: individuals, rests upon the common ground of the agreement of each with
20009: the object, and thus the correctness of the judgement is established.
20010: 
20011: Persuasion, accordingly, cannot be subjectively distinguished from
20012: conviction, that is, so long as the subject views its judgement simply
20013: as a phenomenon of its own mind. But if we inquire whether the grounds
20014: of our judgement, which are valid for us, produce the same effect on
20015: the reason of others as on our own, we have then the means, though only
20016: subjective means, not, indeed, of producing conviction, but of
20017: detecting the merely private validity of the judgement; in other words,
20018: of discovering that there is in it the element of mere persuasion.
20019: 
20020: If we can, in addition to this, develop the subjective causes of the
20021: judgement, which we have taken for its objective grounds, and thus
20022: explain the deceptive judgement as a phenomenon in our mind, apart
20023: altogether from the objective character of the object, we can then
20024: expose the illusion and need be no longer deceived by it, although, if
20025: its subjective cause lies in our nature, we cannot hope altogether to
20026: escape its influence.
20027: 
20028: I can only maintain, that is, affirm as necessarily valid for every
20029: one, that which produces conviction. Persuasion I may keep for myself,
20030: if it is agreeable to me; but I cannot, and ought not, to attempt to
20031: impose it as binding upon others.
20032: 
20033: Holding for true, or the subjective validity of a judgement in relation
20034: to conviction (which is, at the same time, objectively valid), has the
20035: three following degrees: opinion, belief, and knowledge. Opinion is a
20036: consciously insufficient judgement, subjectively as well as
20037: objectively. Belief is subjectively sufficient, but is recognized as
20038: being objectively insufficient. Knowledge is both subjectively and
20039: objectively sufficient. Subjective sufficiency is termed conviction
20040: (for myself); objective sufficiency is termed certainty (for all). I
20041: need not dwell longer on the explanation of such simple conceptions.
20042: 
20043: I must never venture to be of opinion, without knowing something, at
20044: least, by which my judgement, in itself merely problematical, is
20045: brought into connection with the truth—which connection, although not
20046: perfect, is still something more than an arbitrary fiction. Moreover,
20047: the law of such a connection must be certain. For if, in relation to
20048: this law, I have nothing more than opinion, my judgement is but a play
20049: of the imagination, without the least relation to truth. In the
20050: judgements of pure reason, opinion has no place. For, as they do not
20051: rest on empirical grounds and as the sphere of pure reason is that of
20052: necessary truth and à priori cognition, the principle of connection in
20053: it requires universality and necessity, and consequently perfect
20054: certainty—otherwise we should have no guide to the truth at all. Hence
20055: it is absurd to have an opinion in pure mathematics; we must know, or
20056: abstain from forming a judgement altogether. The case is the same with
20057: the maxims of morality. For we must not hazard an action on the mere
20058: opinion that it is allowed, but we must know it to be so. In the
20059: transcendental sphere of reason, on the other hand, the term opinion is
20060: too weak, while the word knowledge is too strong. From the merely
20061: speculative point of view, therefore, we cannot form a judgement at
20062: all. For the subjective grounds of a judgement, such as produce belief,
20063: cannot be admitted in speculative inquiries, inasmuch as they cannot
20064: stand without empirical support and are incapable of being communicated
20065: to others in equal measure.
20066: 
20067: But it is only from the practical point of view that a theoretically
20068: insufficient judgement can be termed belief. Now the practical
20069: reference is either to skill or to morality; to the former, when the
20070: end proposed is arbitrary and accidental, to the latter, when it is
20071: absolutely necessary.
20072: 
20073: If we propose to ourselves any end whatever, the conditions of its
20074: attainment are hypothetically necessary. The necessity is subjectively,
20075: but still only comparatively, sufficient, if I am acquainted with no
20076: other conditions under which the end can be attained. On the other
20077: hand, it is sufficient, absolutely and for every one, if I know for
20078: certain that no one can be acquainted with any other conditions under
20079: which the attainment of the proposed end would be possible. In the
20080: former case my supposition—my judgement with regard to certain
20081: conditions—is a merely accidental belief; in the latter it is a
20082: necessary belief. The physician must pursue some course in the case of
20083: a patient who is in danger, but is ignorant of the nature of the
20084: disease. He observes the symptoms, and concludes, according to the best
20085: of his judgement, that it is a case of phthisis. His belief is, even in
20086: his own judgement, only contingent: another man might, perhaps come
20087: nearer the truth. Such a belief, contingent indeed, but still forming
20088: the ground of the actual use of means for the attainment of certain
20089: ends, I term Pragmatical belief.
20090: 
20091: The usual test, whether that which any one maintains is merely his
20092: persuasion, or his subjective conviction at least, that is, his firm
20093: belief, is a bet. It frequently happens that a man delivers his
20094: opinions with so much boldness and assurance, that he appears to be
20095: under no apprehension as to the possibility of his being in error. The
20096: offer of a bet startles him, and makes him pause. Sometimes it turns
20097: out that his persuasion may be valued at a ducat, but not at ten. For
20098: he does not hesitate, perhaps, to venture a ducat, but if it is
20099: proposed to stake ten, he immediately becomes aware of the possibility
20100: of his being mistaken—a possibility which has hitherto escaped his
20101: observation. If we imagine to ourselves that we have to stake the
20102: happiness of our whole life on the truth of any proposition, our
20103: judgement drops its air of triumph, we take the alarm, and discover the
20104: actual strength of our belief. Thus pragmatical belief has degrees,
20105: varying in proportion to the interests at stake.
20106: 
20107: Now, in cases where we cannot enter upon any course of action in
20108: reference to some object, and where, accordingly, our judgement is
20109: purely theoretical, we can still represent to ourselves, in thought,
20110: the possibility of a course of action, for which we suppose that we
20111: have sufficient grounds, if any means existed of ascertaining the truth
20112: of the matter. Thus we find in purely theoretical judgements an
20113: analogon of practical judgements, to which the word belief may properly
20114: be applied, and which we may term doctrinal belief. I should not
20115: hesitate to stake my all on the truth of the proposition—if there were
20116: any possibility of bringing it to the test of experience—that, at
20117: least, some one of the planets, which we see, is inhabited. Hence I say
20118: that I have not merely the opinion, but the strong belief, on the
20119: correctness of which I would stake even many of the advantages of life,
20120: that there are inhabitants in other worlds.
20121: 
20122: Now we must admit that the doctrine of the existence of God belongs to
20123: doctrinal belief. For, although in respect to the theoretical cognition
20124: of the universe I do not require to form any theory which necessarily
20125: involves this idea, as the condition of my explanation of the phenomena
20126: which the universe presents, but, on the contrary, am rather bound so
20127: to use my reason as if everything were mere nature, still teleological
20128: unity is so important a condition of the application of my reason to
20129: nature, that it is impossible for me to ignore it—especially since, in
20130: addition to these considerations, abundant examples of it are supplied
20131: by experience. But the sole condition, so far as my knowledge extends,
20132: under which this unity can be my guide in the investigation of nature,
20133: is the assumption that a supreme intelligence has ordered all things
20134: according to the wisest ends. Consequently, the hypothesis of a wise
20135: author of the universe is necessary for my guidance in the
20136: investigation of nature—is the condition under which alone I can fulfil
20137: an end which is contingent indeed, but by no means unimportant.
20138: Moreover, since the result of my attempts so frequently confirms the
20139: utility of this assumption, and since nothing decisive can be adduced
20140: against it, it follows that it would be saying far too little to term
20141: my judgement, in this case, a mere opinion, and that, even in this
20142: theoretical connection, I may assert that I firmly believe in God.
20143: Still, if we use words strictly, this must not be called a practical,
20144: but a doctrinal belief, which the theology of nature (physico-theology)
20145: must also produce in my mind. In the wisdom of a Supreme Being, and in
20146: the shortness of life, so inadequate to the development of the glorious
20147: powers of human nature, we may find equally sufficient grounds for a
20148: doctrinal belief in the future life of the human soul.
20149: 
20150: The expression of belief is, in such cases, an expression of modesty
20151: from the objective point of view, but, at the same time, of firm
20152: confidence, from the subjective. If I should venture to term this
20153: merely theoretical judgement even so much as a hypothesis which I am
20154: entitled to assume; a more complete conception, with regard to another
20155: world and to the cause of the world, might then be justly required of
20156: me than I am, in reality, able to give. For, if I assume anything, even
20157: as a mere hypothesis, I must, at least, know so much of the properties
20158: of such a being as will enable me, not to form the conception, but to
20159: imagine the existence of it. But the word belief refers only to the
20160: guidance which an idea gives me, and to its subjective influence on the
20161: conduct of my reason, which forces me to hold it fast, though I may not
20162: be in a position to give a speculative account of it.
20163: 
20164: But mere doctrinal belief is, to some extent, wanting in stability. We
20165: often quit our hold of it, in consequence of the difficulties which
20166: occur in speculation, though in the end we inevitably return to it
20167: again.
20168: 
20169: It is quite otherwise with moral belief. For in this sphere action is
20170: absolutely necessary, that is, I must act in obedience to the moral law
20171: in all points. The end is here incontrovertibly established, and there
20172: is only one condition possible, according to the best of my perception,
20173: under which this end can harmonize with all other ends, and so have
20174: practical validity—namely, the existence of a God and of a future
20175: world. I know also, to a certainty, that no one can be acquainted with
20176: any other conditions which conduct to the same unity of ends under the
20177: moral law. But since the moral precept is, at the same time, my maxim
20178: (as reason requires that it should be), I am irresistibly constrained
20179: to believe in the existence of God and in a future life; and I am sure
20180: that nothing can make me waver in this belief, since I should thereby
20181: overthrow my moral maxims, the renunciation of which would render me
20182: hateful in my own eyes.
20183: 
20184: Thus, while all the ambitious attempts of reason to penetrate beyond
20185: the limits of experience end in disappointment, there is still enough
20186: left to satisfy us in a practical point of view. No one, it is true,
20187: will be able to boast that he knows that there is a God and a future
20188: life; for, if he knows this, he is just the man whom I have long wished
20189: to find. All knowledge, regarding an object of mere reason, can be
20190: communicated; and I should thus be enabled to hope that my own
20191: knowledge would receive this wonderful extension, through the
20192: instrumentality of his instruction. No, my conviction is not logical,
20193: but moral certainty; and since it rests on subjective grounds (of the
20194: moral sentiment), I must not even say: It is morally certain that there
20195: is a God, etc., but: I am morally certain, that is, my belief in God
20196: and in another world is so interwoven with my moral nature that I am
20197: under as little apprehension of having the former torn from me as of
20198: losing the latter.
20199: 
20200: The only point in this argument that may appear open to suspicion is
20201: that this rational belief presupposes the existence of moral
20202: sentiments. If we give up this assumption, and take a man who is
20203: entirely indifferent with regard to moral laws, the question which
20204: reason proposes, becomes then merely a problem for speculation and may,
20205: indeed, be supported by strong grounds from analogy, but not by such as
20206: will compel the most obstinate scepticism to give way.[79] But in these
20207: questions no man is free from all interest. For though the want of good
20208: sentiments may place him beyond the influence of moral interests, still
20209: even in this case enough may be left to make him fear the existence of
20210: God and a future life. For he cannot pretend to any certainty of the
20211: non-existence of God and of a future life, unless—since it could only
20212: be proved by mere reason, and therefore apodeictically—he is prepared
20213: to establish the impossibility of both, which certainly no reasonable
20214: man would undertake to do. This would be a negative belief, which could
20215: not, indeed, produce morality and good sentiments, but still could
20216: produce an analogon of these, by operating as a powerful restraint on
20217: the outbreak of evil dispositions.
20218: 
20219:  [79] The human mind (as, I believe, every rational being must of
20220:  necessity do) takes a natural interest in morality, although this
20221:  interest is not undivided, and may not be practically in
20222:  preponderance. If you strengthen and increase it, you will find the
20223:  reason become docile, more enlightened, and more capable of uniting
20224:  the speculative interest with the practical. But if you do not take
20225:  care at the outset, or at least midway, to make men good, you will
20226:  never force them into an honest belief.
20227: 
20228: 
20229: But, it will be said, is this all that pure reason can effect, in
20230: opening up prospects beyond the limits of experience? Nothing more than
20231: two articles of belief? Common sense could have done as much as this,
20232: without taking the philosophers to counsel in the matter!
20233: 
20234: I shall not here eulogize philosophy for the benefits which the
20235: laborious efforts of its criticism have conferred on human reason—even
20236: granting that its merit should turn out in the end to be only
20237: negative—for on this point something more will be said in the next
20238: section. But, I ask, do you require that that knowledge which concerns
20239: all men, should transcend the common understanding, and should only be
20240: revealed to you by philosophers? The very circumstance which has called
20241: forth your censure, is the best confirmation of the correctness of our
20242: previous assertions, since it discloses, what could not have been
20243: foreseen, that Nature is not chargeable with any partial distribution
20244: of her gifts in those matters which concern all men without distinction
20245: and that, in respect to the essential ends of human nature, we cannot
20246: advance further with the help of the highest philosophy, than under the
20247: guidance which nature has vouchsafed to the meanest understanding.
20248: 
20249: Chapter III. The Architectonic of Pure Reason
20250: 
20251: By the term architectonic I mean the art of constructing a system.
20252: Without systematic unity, our knowledge cannot become science; it will
20253: be an aggregate, and not a system. Thus architectonic is the doctrine
20254: of the scientific in cognition, and therefore necessarily forms part of
20255: our methodology.
20256: 
20257: Reason cannot permit our knowledge to remain in an unconnected and
20258: rhapsodistic state, but requires that the sum of our cognitions should
20259: constitute a system. It is thus alone that they can advance the ends of
20260: reason. By a system I mean the unity of various cognitions under one
20261: idea. This idea is the conception—given by reason—of the form of a
20262: whole, in so far as the conception determines à priori not only the
20263: limits of its content, but the place which each of its parts is to
20264: occupy. The scientific idea contains, therefore, the end and the form
20265: of the whole which is in accordance with that end. The unity of the
20266: end, to which all the parts of the system relate, and through which all
20267: have a relation to each other, communicates unity to the whole system,
20268: so that the absence of any part can be immediately detected from our
20269: knowledge of the rest; and it determines à priori the limits of the
20270: system, thus excluding all contingent or arbitrary additions. The whole
20271: is thus an organism (articulatio), and not an aggregate (coacervatio);
20272: it may grow from within (per intussusceptionem), but it cannot increase
20273: by external additions (per appositionem). It is, thus, like an animal
20274: body, the growth of which does not add any limb, but, without changing
20275: their proportions, makes each in its sphere stronger and more active.
20276: 
20277: We require, for the execution of the idea of a system, a schema, that
20278: is, a content and an arrangement of parts determined à priori by the
20279: principle which the aim of the system prescribes. A schema which is not
20280: projected in accordance with an idea, that is, from the standpoint of
20281: the highest aim of reason, but merely empirically, in accordance with
20282: accidental aims and purposes (the number of which cannot be
20283: predetermined), can give us nothing more than technical unity. But the
20284: schema which is originated from an idea (in which case reason presents
20285: us with aims à priori, and does not look for them to experience), forms
20286: the basis of architectonical unity. A science, in the proper
20287: acceptation of that term, cannot be formed technically, that is, from
20288: observation of the similarity existing between different objects, and
20289: the purely contingent use we make of our knowledge in concreto with
20290: reference to all kinds of arbitrary external aims; its constitution
20291: must be framed on architectonical principles, that is, its parts must
20292: be shown to possess an essential affinity, and be capable of being
20293: deduced from one supreme and internal aim or end, which forms the
20294: condition of the possibility of the scientific whole. The schema of a
20295: science must give à priori the plan of it (monogramma), and the
20296: division of the whole into parts, in conformity with the idea of the
20297: science; and it must also distinguish this whole from all others,
20298: according to certain understood principles.
20299: 
20300: No one will attempt to construct a science, unless he have some idea to
20301: rest on as a proper basis. But, in the elaboration of the science, he
20302: finds that the schema, nay, even the definition which he at first gave
20303: of the science, rarely corresponds with his idea; for this idea lies,
20304: like a germ, in our reason, its parts undeveloped and hid even from
20305: microscopical observation. For this reason, we ought to explain and
20306: define sciences, not according to the description which the originator
20307: gives of them, but according to the idea which we find based in reason
20308: itself, and which is suggested by the natural unity of the parts of the
20309: science already accumulated. For it will of ten be found that the
20310: originator of a science and even his latest successors remain attached
20311: to an erroneous idea, which they cannot render clear to themselves, and
20312: that they thus fail in determining the true content, the articulation
20313: or systematic unity, and the limits of their science.
20314: 
20315: It is unfortunate that, only after having occupied ourselves for a long
20316: time in the collection of materials, under the guidance of an idea
20317: which lies undeveloped in the mind, but not according to any definite
20318: plan of arrangement—nay, only after we have spent much time and labour
20319: in the technical disposition of our materials, does it become possible
20320: to view the idea of a science in a clear light, and to project,
20321: according to architectonical principles, a plan of the whole, in
20322: accordance with the aims of reason. Systems seem, like certain worms,
20323: to be formed by a kind of generatio aequivoca—by the mere confluence of
20324: conceptions, and to gain completeness only with the progress of time.
20325: But the schema or germ of all lies in reason; and thus is not only
20326: every system organized according to its own idea, but all are united
20327: into one grand system of human knowledge, of which they form members.
20328: For this reason, it is possible to frame an architectonic of all human
20329: cognition, the formation of which, at the present time, considering the
20330: immense materials collected or to be found in the ruins of old systems,
20331: would not indeed be very difficult. Our purpose at present is merely to
20332: sketch the plan of the architectonic of all cognition given by pure
20333: reason; and we begin from the point where the main root of human
20334: knowledge divides into two, one of which is reason. By reason I
20335: understand here the whole higher faculty of cognition, the rational
20336: being placed in contradistinction to the empirical.
20337: 
20338: If I make complete abstraction of the content of cognition, objectively
20339: considered, all cognition is, from a subjective point of view, either
20340: historical or rational. Historical cognition is cognitio ex datis,
20341: rational, cognitio ex principiis. Whatever may be the original source
20342: of a cognition, it is, in relation to the person who possesses it,
20343: merely historical, if he knows only what has been given him from
20344: another quarter, whether that knowledge was communicated by direct
20345: experience or by instruction. Thus the Person who has learned a system
20346: of philosophy—say the Wolfian—although he has a perfect knowledge of
20347: all the principles, definitions, and arguments in that philosophy, as
20348: well as of the divisions that have been made of the system, possesses
20349: really no more than an historical knowledge of the Wolfian system; he
20350: knows only what has been told him, his judgements are only those which
20351: he has received from his teachers. Dispute the validity of a
20352: definition, and he is completely at a loss to find another. He has
20353: formed his mind on another’s; but the imitative faculty is not the
20354: productive. His knowledge has not been drawn from reason; and although,
20355: objectively considered, it is rational knowledge, subjectively, it is
20356: merely historical. He has learned this or that philosophy and is merely
20357: a plaster cast of a living man. Rational cognitions which are
20358: objective, that is, which have their source in reason, can be so termed
20359: from a subjective point of view, only when they have been drawn by the
20360: individual himself from the sources of reason, that is, from
20361: principles; and it is in this way alone that criticism, or even the
20362: rejection of what has been already learned, can spring up in the mind.
20363: 
20364: All rational cognition is, again, based either on conceptions, or on
20365: the construction of conceptions. The former is termed philosophical,
20366: the latter mathematical. I have already shown the essential difference
20367: of these two methods of cognition in the first chapter. A cognition may
20368: be objectively philosophical and subjectively historical—as is the case
20369: with the majority of scholars and those who cannot look beyond the
20370: limits of their system, and who remain in a state of pupilage all their
20371: lives. But it is remarkable that mathematical knowledge, when committed
20372: to memory, is valid, from the subjective point of view, as rational
20373: knowledge also, and that the same distinction cannot be drawn here as
20374: in the case of philosophical cognition. The reason is that the only way
20375: of arriving at this knowledge is through the essential principles of
20376: reason, and thus it is always certain and indisputable; because reason
20377: is employed in concreto—but at the same time à priori—that is, in pure
20378: and, therefore, infallible intuition; and thus all causes of illusion
20379: and error are excluded. Of all the à priori sciences of reason,
20380: therefore, mathematics alone can be learned. Philosophy—unless it be in
20381: an historical manner—cannot be learned; we can at most learn to
20382: philosophize.
20383: 
20384: Philosophy is the system of all philosophical cognition. We must use
20385: this term in an objective sense, if we understand by it the archetype
20386: of all attempts at philosophizing, and the standard by which all
20387: subjective philosophies are to be judged. In this sense, philosophy is
20388: merely the idea of a possible science, which does not exist in
20389: concreto, but to which we endeavour in various ways to approximate,
20390: until we have discovered the right path to pursue—a path overgrown by
20391: the errors and illusions of sense—and the image we have hitherto tried
20392: in vain to shape has become a perfect copy of the great prototype.
20393: Until that time, we cannot learn philosophy—it does not exist; if it
20394: does, where is it, who possesses it, and how shall we know it? We can
20395: only learn to philosophize; in other words, we can only exercise our
20396: powers of reasoning in accordance with general principles, retaining at
20397: the same time, the right of investigating the sources of these
20398: principles, of testing, and even of rejecting them.
20399: 
20400: Until then, our conception of philosophy is only a scholastic
20401: conception—a conception, that is, of a system of cognition which we are
20402: trying to elaborate into a science; all that we at present know being
20403: the systematic unity of this cognition, and consequently the logical
20404: completeness of the cognition for the desired end. But there is also a
20405: cosmical conception (conceptus cosmicus) of philosophy, which has
20406: always formed the true basis of this term, especially when philosophy
20407: was personified and presented to us in the ideal of a philosopher. In
20408: this view philosophy is the science of the relation of all cognition to
20409: the ultimate and essential aims of human reason (teleologia rationis
20410: humanae), and the philosopher is not merely an artist—who occupies
20411: himself with conceptions—but a lawgiver, legislating for human reason.
20412: In this sense of the word, it would be in the highest degree arrogant
20413: to assume the title of philosopher, and to pretend that we had reached
20414: the perfection of the prototype which lies in the idea alone.
20415: 
20416: The mathematician, the natural philosopher, and the logician—how far
20417: soever the first may have advanced in rational, and the two latter in
20418: philosophical knowledge—are merely artists, engaged in the arrangement
20419: and formation of conceptions; they cannot be termed philosophers. Above
20420: them all, there is the ideal teacher, who employs them as instruments
20421: for the advancement of the essential aims of human reason. Him alone
20422: can we call philosopher; but he nowhere exists. But the idea of his
20423: legislative power resides in the mind of every man, and it alone
20424: teaches us what kind of systematic unity philosophy demands in view of
20425: the ultimate aims of reason. This idea is, therefore, a cosmical
20426: conception.[80]
20427: 
20428:  [80] By a cosmical conception, I mean one in which all men necessarily
20429:  take an interest; the aim of a science must accordingly be determined
20430:  according to scholastic conceptions, if it is regarded merely as a
20431:  means to certain arbitrarily proposed ends.
20432: 
20433: 
20434: In view of the complete systematic unity of reason, there can only be
20435: one ultimate end of all the operations of the mind. To this all other
20436: aims are subordinate, and nothing more than means for its attainment.
20437: This ultimate end is the destination of man, and the philosophy which
20438: relates to it is termed moral philosophy. The superior position
20439: occupied by moral philosophy, above all other spheres for the
20440: operations of reason, sufficiently indicates the reason why the
20441: ancients always included the idea—and in an especial manner—of moralist
20442: in that of philosopher. Even at the present day, we call a man who
20443: appears to have the power of self-government, even although his
20444: knowledge may be very limited, by the name of philosopher.
20445: 
20446: The legislation of human reason, or philosophy, has two objects—nature
20447: and freedom—and thus contains not only the laws of nature, but also
20448: those of ethics, at first in two separate systems, which, finally,
20449: merge into one grand philosophical system of cognition. The philosophy
20450: of nature relates to that which is, that of ethics to that which ought
20451: to be.
20452: 
20453: But all philosophy is either cognition on the basis of pure reason, or
20454: the cognition of reason on the basis of empirical principles. The
20455: former is termed pure, the latter empirical philosophy.
20456: 
20457: The philosophy of pure reason is either propædeutic, that is, an
20458: inquiry into the powers of reason in regard to pure à priori cognition,
20459: and is termed critical philosophy; or it is, secondly, the system of
20460: pure reason—a science containing the systematic presentation of the
20461: whole body of philosophical knowledge, true as well as illusory, given
20462: by pure reason—and is called metaphysic. This name may, however, be
20463: also given to the whole system of pure philosophy, critical philosophy
20464: included, and may designate the investigation into the sources or
20465: possibility of à priori cognition, as well as the presentation of the à
20466: priori cognitions which form a system of pure philosophy—excluding, at
20467: the same time, all empirical and mathematical elements.
20468: 
20469: Metaphysic is divided into that of the speculative and that of the
20470: practical use of pure reason, and is, accordingly, either the
20471: metaphysic of nature, or the metaphysic of ethics. The former contains
20472: all the pure rational principles—based upon conceptions alone (and thus
20473: excluding mathematics)—of all theoretical cognition; the latter, the
20474: principles which determine and necessitate à priori all action. Now
20475: moral philosophy alone contains a code of laws—for the regulation of
20476: our actions—which are deduced from principles entirely à priori. Hence
20477: the metaphysic of ethics is the only pure moral philosophy, as it is
20478: not based upon anthropological or other empirical considerations. The
20479: metaphysic of speculative reason is what is commonly called metaphysic
20480: in the more limited sense. But as pure moral philosophy properly forms
20481: a part of this system of cognition, we must allow it to retain the name
20482: of metaphysic, although it is not requisite that we should insist on so
20483: terming it in our present discussion.
20484: 
20485: It is of the highest importance to separate those cognitions which
20486: differ from others both in kind and in origin, and to take great care
20487: that they are not confounded with those with which they are generally
20488: found connected. What the chemist does in the analysis of substances,
20489: what the mathematician in pure mathematics, is, in a still higher
20490: degree, the duty of the philosopher, that the value of each different
20491: kind of cognition, and the part it takes in the operations of the mind,
20492: may be clearly defined. Human reason has never wanted a metaphysic of
20493: some kind, since it attained the power of thought, or rather of
20494: reflection; but it has never been able to keep this sphere of thought
20495: and cognition pure from all admixture of foreign elements. The idea of
20496: a science of this kind is as old as speculation itself; and what mind
20497: does not speculate—either in the scholastic or in the popular fashion?
20498: At the same time, it must be admitted that even thinkers by profession
20499: have been unable clearly to explain the distinction between the two
20500: elements of our cognition—the one completely à priori, the other à
20501: posteriori; and hence the proper definition of a peculiar kind of
20502: cognition, and with it the just idea of a science which has so long and
20503: so deeply engaged the attention of the human mind, has never been
20504: established. When it was said: “Metaphysic is the science of the first
20505: principles of human cognition,” this definition did not signalize a
20506: peculiarity in kind, but only a difference in degree; these first
20507: principles were thus declared to be more general than others, but no
20508: criterion of distinction from empirical principles was given. Of these
20509: some are more general, and therefore higher, than others; and—as we
20510: cannot distinguish what is completely à priori from that which is known
20511: to be à posteriori—where shall we draw the line which is to separate
20512: the higher and so-called first principles, from the lower and
20513: subordinate principles of cognition? What would be said if we were
20514: asked to be satisfied with a division of the epochs of the world into
20515: the earlier centuries and those following them? “Does the fifth, or the
20516: tenth century belong to the earlier centuries?” it would be asked. In
20517: the same way I ask: Does the conception of extension belong to
20518: metaphysics? You answer, “Yes.” Well, that of body too? “Yes.” And that
20519: of a fluid body? You stop, you are unprepared to admit this; for if you
20520: do, everything will belong to metaphysics. From this it is evident that
20521: the mere degree of subordination—of the particular to the
20522: general—cannot determine the limits of a science; and that, in the
20523: present case, we must expect to find a difference in the conceptions of
20524: metaphysics both in kind and in origin. The fundamental idea of
20525: metaphysics was obscured on another side by the fact that this kind of
20526: à priori cognition showed a certain similarity in character with the
20527: science of mathematics. Both have the property in common of possessing
20528: an à priori origin; but, in the one, our knowledge is based upon
20529: conceptions, in the other, on the construction of conceptions. Thus a
20530: decided dissimilarity between philosophical and mathematical cognition
20531: comes out—a dissimilarity which was always felt, but which could not be
20532: made distinct for want of an insight into the criteria of the
20533: difference. And thus it happened that, as philosophers themselves
20534: failed in the proper development of the idea of their science, the
20535: elaboration of the science could not proceed with a definite aim, or
20536: under trustworthy guidance. Thus, too, philosophers, ignorant of the
20537: path they ought to pursue and always disputing with each other
20538: regarding the discoveries which each asserted he had made, brought
20539: their science into disrepute with the rest of the world, and finally,
20540: even among themselves.
20541: 
20542: All pure à priori cognition forms, therefore, in view of the peculiar
20543: faculty which originates it, a peculiar and distinct unity; and
20544: metaphysic is the term applied to the philosophy which attempts to
20545: represent that cognition in this systematic unity. The speculative part
20546: of metaphysic, which has especially appropriated this appellation—that
20547: which we have called the metaphysic of nature—and which considers
20548: everything, as it is (not as it ought to be), by means of à priori
20549: conceptions, is divided in the following manner.
20550: 
20551: Metaphysic, in the more limited acceptation of the term, consists of
20552: two parts—transcendental philosophy and the physiology of pure reason.
20553: The former presents the system of all the conceptions and principles
20554: belonging to the understanding and the reason, and which relate to
20555: objects in general, but not to any particular given objects
20556: (Ontologia); the latter has nature for its subject-matter, that is, the
20557: sum of given objects—whether given to the senses, or, if we will, to
20558: some other kind of intuition—and is accordingly physiology, although
20559: only rationalis. But the use of the faculty of reason in this rational
20560: mode of regarding nature is either physical or hyperphysical, or, more
20561: properly speaking, immanent or transcendent. The former relates to
20562: nature, in so far as our knowledge regarding it may be applied in
20563: experience (in concreto); the latter to that connection of the objects
20564: of experience, which transcends all experience. Transcendent physiology
20565: has, again, an internal and an external connection with its object,
20566: both, however, transcending possible experience; the former is the
20567: physiology of nature as a whole, or transcendental cognition of the
20568: world, the latter of the connection of the whole of nature with a being
20569: above nature, or transcendental cognition of God.
20570: 
20571: Immanent physiology, on the contrary, considers nature as the sum of
20572: all sensuous objects, consequently, as it is presented to us—but still
20573: according to à priori conditions, for it is under these alone that
20574: nature can be presented to our minds at all. The objects of immanent
20575: physiology are of two kinds: 1. Those of the external senses, or
20576: corporeal nature; 2. The object of the internal sense, the soul, or, in
20577: accordance with our fundamental conceptions of it, thinking nature. The
20578: metaphysics of corporeal nature is called physics; but, as it must
20579: contain only the principles of an à priori cognition of nature, we must
20580: term it rational physics. The metaphysics of thinking nature is called
20581: psychology, and for the same reason is to be regarded as merely the
20582: rational cognition of the soul.
20583: 
20584: Thus the whole system of metaphysics consists of four principal parts:
20585: 1. Ontology; 2. Rational Physiology; 3. Rational cosmology; and 4.
20586: Rational theology. The second part—that of the rational doctrine of
20587: nature—may be subdivided into two, physica rationalis[81] and
20588: psychologia rationalis.
20589: 
20590:  [81] It must not be supposed that I mean by this appellation what is
20591:  generally called physica general is, and which is rather mathematics
20592:  than a philosophy of nature. For the metaphysic of nature is
20593:  completely different from mathematics, nor is it so rich in results,
20594:  although it is of great importance as a critical test of the
20595:  application of pure understanding—cognition to nature. For want of its
20596:  guidance, even mathematicians, adopting certain common notions—which
20597:  are, in fact, metaphysical—have unconsciously crowded their theories
20598:  of nature with hypotheses, the fallacy of which becomes evident upon
20599:  the application of the principles of this metaphysic, without
20600:  detriment, however, to the employment of mathematics in this sphere of
20601:  cognition.
20602: 
20603: 
20604: The fundamental idea of a philosophy of pure reason of necessity
20605: dictates this division; it is, therefore, architectonical—in accordance
20606: with the highest aims of reason, and not merely technical, or according
20607: to certain accidentally-observed similarities existing between the
20608: different parts of the whole science. For this reason, also, is the
20609: division immutable and of legislative authority. But the reader may
20610: observe in it a few points to which he ought to demur, and which may
20611: weaken his conviction of its truth and legitimacy.
20612: 
20613: In the first place, how can I desire an à priori cognition or
20614: metaphysic of objects, in so far as they are given à posteriori? and
20615: how is it possible to cognize the nature of things according to à
20616: priori principles, and to attain to a rational physiology? The answer
20617: is this. We take from experience nothing more than is requisite to
20618: present us with an object (in general) of the external or of the
20619: internal sense; in the former case, by the mere conception of matter
20620: (impenetrable and inanimate extension), in the latter, by the
20621: conception of a thinking being—given in the internal empirical
20622: representation, I think. As to the rest, we must not employ in our
20623: metaphysic of these objects any empirical principles (which add to the
20624: content of our conceptions by means of experience), for the purpose of
20625: forming by their help any judgements respecting these objects.
20626: 
20627: Secondly, what place shall we assign to empirical psychology, which has
20628: always been considered a part of metaphysics, and from which in our
20629: time such important philosophical results have been expected, after the
20630: hope of constructing an à priori system of knowledge had been
20631: abandoned? I answer: It must be placed by the side of empirical physics
20632: or physics proper; that is, must be regarded as forming a part of
20633: applied philosophy, the à priori principles of which are contained in
20634: pure philosophy, which is therefore connected, although it must not be
20635: confounded, with psychology. Empirical psychology must therefore be
20636: banished from the sphere of metaphysics, and is indeed excluded by the
20637: very idea of that science. In conformity, however, with scholastic
20638: usage, we must permit it to occupy a place in metaphysics—but only as
20639: an appendix to it. We adopt this course from motives of economy; as
20640: psychology is not as yet full enough to occupy our attention as an
20641: independent study, while it is, at the same time, of too great
20642: importance to be entirely excluded or placed where it has still less
20643: affinity than it has with the subject of metaphysics. It is a stranger
20644: who has been long a guest; and we make it welcome to stay, until it can
20645: take up a more suitable abode in a complete system of anthropology—the
20646: pendant to empirical physics.
20647: 
20648: The above is the general idea of metaphysics, which, as more was
20649: expected from it than could be looked for with justice, and as these
20650: pleasant expectations were unfortunately never realized, fell into
20651: general disrepute. Our Critique must have fully convinced the reader
20652: that, although metaphysics cannot form the foundation of religion, it
20653: must always be one of its most important bulwarks, and that human
20654: reason, which naturally pursues a dialectical course, cannot do without
20655: this science, which checks its tendencies towards dialectic and, by
20656: elevating reason to a scientific and clear self-knowledge, prevents the
20657: ravages which a lawless speculative reason would infallibly commit in
20658: the sphere of morals as well as in that of religion. We may be sure,
20659: therefore, whatever contempt may be thrown upon metaphysics by those
20660: who judge a science not by its own nature, but according to the
20661: accidental effects it may have produced, that it can never be
20662: completely abandoned, that we must always return to it as to a beloved
20663: one who has been for a time estranged, because the questions with which
20664: it is engaged relate to the highest aims of humanity, and reason must
20665: always labour either to attain to settled views in regard to these, or
20666: to destroy those which others have already established.
20667: 
20668: Metaphysic, therefore—that of nature, as well as that of ethics, but in
20669: an especial manner the criticism which forms the propædeutic to all
20670: the operations of reason—forms properly that department of knowledge
20671: which may be termed, in the truest sense of the word, philosophy. The
20672: path which it pursues is that of science, which, when it has once been
20673: discovered, is never lost, and never misleads. Mathematics, natural
20674: science, the common experience of men, have a high value as means, for
20675: the most part, to accidental ends—but at last also, to those which are
20676: necessary and essential to the existence of humanity. But to guide them
20677: to this high goal, they require the aid of rational cognition on the
20678: basis of pure conceptions, which, be it termed as it may, is properly
20679: nothing but metaphysics.
20680: 
20681: For the same reason, metaphysics forms likewise the completion of the
20682: culture of human reason. In this respect, it is indispensable, setting
20683: aside altogether the influence which it exerts as a science. For its
20684: subject-matter is the elements and highest maxims of reason, which form
20685: the basis of the possibility of some sciences and of the use of all.
20686: That, as a purely speculative science, it is more useful in preventing
20687: error than in the extension of knowledge, does not detract from its
20688: value; on the contrary, the supreme office of censor which it occupies
20689: assures to it the highest authority and importance. This office it
20690: administers for the purpose of securing order, harmony, and well-being
20691: to science, and of directing its noble and fruitful labours to the
20692: highest possible aim—the happiness of all mankind.
20693: 
20694: Chapter IV. The History of Pure Reason
20695: 
20696: This title is placed here merely for the purpose of designating a
20697: division of the system of pure reason of which I do not intend to treat
20698: at present. I shall content myself with casting a cursory glance, from
20699: a purely transcendental point of view—that of the nature of pure
20700: reason—on the labours of philosophers up to the present time. They have
20701: aimed at erecting an edifice of philosophy; but to my eye this edifice
20702: appears to be in a very ruinous condition.
20703: 
20704: It is very remarkable, although naturally it could not have been
20705: otherwise, that, in the infancy of philosophy, the study of the nature
20706: of God and the constitution of a future world formed the commencement,
20707: rather than the conclusion, as we should have it, of the speculative
20708: efforts of the human mind. However rude the religious conceptions
20709: generated by the remains of the old manners and customs of a less
20710: cultivated time, the intelligent classes were not thereby prevented
20711: from devoting themselves to free inquiry into the existence and nature
20712: of God; and they easily saw that there could be no surer way of
20713: pleasing the invisible ruler of the world, and of attaining to
20714: happiness in another world at least, than a good and honest course of
20715: life in this. Thus theology and morals formed the two chief motives, or
20716: rather the points of attraction in all abstract inquiries. But it was
20717: the former that especially occupied the attention of speculative
20718: reason, and which afterwards became so celebrated under the name of
20719: metaphysics.
20720: 
20721: I shall not at present indicate the periods of time at which the
20722: greatest changes in metaphysics took place, but shall merely give a
20723: hasty sketch of the different ideas which occasioned the most important
20724: revolutions in this sphere of thought. There are three different ends
20725: in relation to which these revolutions have taken place.
20726: 
20727: 1. In relation to the object of the cognition of reason, philosophers
20728: may be divided into sensualists and intellectualists. Epicurus may be
20729: regarded as the head of the former, Plato of the latter. The
20730: distinction here signalized, subtle as it is, dates from the earliest
20731: times, and was long maintained. The former asserted that reality
20732: resides in sensuous objects alone, and that everything else is merely
20733: imaginary; the latter, that the senses are the parents of illusion and
20734: that truth is to be found in the understanding alone. The former did
20735: not deny to the conceptions of the understanding a certain kind of
20736: reality; but with them it was merely logical, with the others it was
20737: mystical. The former admitted intellectual conceptions, but declared
20738: that sensuous objects alone possessed real existence. The latter
20739: maintained that all real objects were intelligible, and believed that
20740: the pure understanding possessed a faculty of intuition apart from
20741: sense, which, in their opinion, served only to confuse the ideas of the
20742: understanding.
20743: 
20744: 2. In relation to the origin of the pure cognitions of reason, we find
20745: one school maintaining that they are derived entirely from experience,
20746: and another that they have their origin in reason alone. Aristotle may
20747: be regarded as the head of the empiricists, and Plato of the
20748: noologists. Locke, the follower of Aristotle in modern times, and
20749: Leibnitz of Plato (although he cannot be said to have imitated him in
20750: his mysticism), have not been able to bring this question to a settled
20751: conclusion. The procedure of Epicurus in his sensual system, in which
20752: he always restricted his conclusions to the sphere of experience, was
20753: much more consequent than that of Aristotle and Locke. The latter
20754: especially, after having derived all the conceptions and principles of
20755: the mind from experience, goes so far, in the employment of these
20756: conceptions and principles, as to maintain that we can prove the
20757: existence of God and the existence of God and the immortality of them
20758: objects lying beyond the soul—both of them of possible experience—with
20759: the same force of demonstration as any mathematical proposition.
20760: 
20761: 3. In relation to method. Method is procedure according to principles.
20762: We may divide the methods at present employed in the field of inquiry
20763: into the naturalistic and the scientific. The naturalist of pure reason
20764: lays it down as his principle that common reason, without the aid of
20765: science—which he calls sound reason, or common sense—can give a more
20766: satisfactory answer to the most important questions of metaphysics than
20767: speculation is able to do. He must maintain, therefore, that we can
20768: determine the content and circumference of the moon more certainly by
20769: the naked eye, than by the aid of mathematical reasoning. But this
20770: system is mere misology reduced to principles; and, what is the most
20771: absurd thing in this doctrine, the neglect of all scientific means is
20772: paraded as a peculiar method of extending our cognition. As regards
20773: those who are naturalists because they know no better, they are
20774: certainly not to be blamed. They follow common sense, without parading
20775: their ignorance as a method which is to teach us the wonderful secret,
20776: how we are to find the truth which lies at the bottom of the well of
20777: Democritus.

20781: —Satirae, iii. 78-79.
20782: 
20783: 
20784:  is their motto, under which they may lead a pleasant and praiseworthy
20785:  life, without troubling themselves with science or troubling science
20786:  with them.
20787: 
20788: As regards those who wish to pursue a scientific method, they have now
20789: the choice of following either the dogmatical or the sceptical, while
20790: they are bound never to desert the systematic mode of procedure. When I
20791: mention, in relation to the former, the celebrated Wolf, and as regards
20792: the latter, David Hume, I may leave, in accordance with my present
20793: intention, all others unnamed. The critical path alone is still open.
20794: If my reader has been kind and patient enough to accompany me on this
20795: hitherto untravelled route, he can now judge whether, if he and others
20796: will contribute their exertions towards making this narrow footpath a
20797: high road of thought, that which many centuries have failed to
20798: accomplish may not be executed before the close of the present—namely,
20799: to bring Reason to perfect contentment in regard to that which has
20800: always, but without permanent results, occupied her powers and engaged
20801: her ardent desire for knowledge.
