38: PREFACE.
39: 
40: This work is called the Critique of Practical Reason, not of the
41: pure practical reason, although its parallelism with the speculative
42: critique would seem to require the latter term. The reason of this
43: appears sufficiently from the treatise itself. Its business is to show
44: that there is pure practical reason, and for this purpose it
45: criticizes the entire practical faculty of reason. If it succeeds in
46: this, it has no need to criticize the pure faculty itself in order
47: to see whether reason in making such a claim does not presumptuously
48: overstep itself (as is the case with the speculative reason). For
49: if, as pure reason, it is actually practical, it proves its own
50: reality and that of its concepts by fact, and all disputation
51: against the possibility of its being real is futile.
52: 
53: With this faculty, transcendental freedom is also established;
54: freedom, namely, in that absolute sense in which speculative reason
55: required it in its use of the concept of causality in order to
56: escape the antinomy into which it inevitably falls, when in the
57: chain of cause and effect it tries to think the unconditioned.
58: Speculative reason could only exhibit this concept (of freedom)
59: problematically as not impossible to thought, without assuring it
60: any objective reality, and merely lest the supposed impossibility of
61: what it must at least allow to be thinkable should endanger its very
62: being and plunge it into an abyss of scepticism.
63: 
64: Inasmuch as the reality of the concept of freedom is proved by an
65: apodeictic law of practical reason, it is the keystone of the whole
66: system of pure reason, even the speculative, and all other concepts
67: (those of God and immortality) which, as being mere ideas, remain in
68: it unsupported, now attach themselves to this concept, and by it
69: obtain consistence and objective reality; that is to say, their
70: possibility is proved by the fact that freedom actually exists, for
71: this idea is revealed by the moral law.
72: 
73: Freedom, however, is the only one of all the ideas of the
74: speculative reason of which we know the possibility a priori (without,
75: however, understanding it), because it is the condition of the moral
76: law which we know. * The ideas of God and immortality, however, are
77: not conditions of the moral law, but only conditions of the necessary
78: object of a will determined by this law; that is to say, conditions of
79: the practical use of our pure reason. Hence, with respect to these
80: ideas, we cannot affirm that we know and understand, I will not say
81: the actuality, but even the possibility of them. However they are
82: the conditions of the application of the morally determined will to
83: its object, which is given to it a priori, viz., the summum bonum.
84: Consequently in this practical point of view their possibility must be
85: assumed, although we cannot theoretically know and understand it. To
86: justify this assumption it is sufficient, in a practical point of
87: view, that they contain no intrinsic impossibility (contradiction).
88: Here we have what, as far as speculative reason is concerned, is a
89: merely subjective principle of assent, which, however, is
90: objectively valid for a reason equally pure but practical, and this
91: principle, by means of the concept of freedom, assures objective
92: reality and authority to the ideas of God and immortality. Nay,
93: there is a subjective necessity (a need of pure reason) to assume
94: them. Nevertheless the theoretical knowledge of reason is not hereby
95: enlarged, but only the possibility is given, which heretofore was
96: merely a problem and now becomes assertion, and thus the practical use
97: of reason is connected with the elements of theoretical reason. And
98: this need is not a merely hypothetical one for the arbitrary
99: purposes of speculation, that we must assume something if we wish in
100: speculation to carry reason to its utmost limits, but it is a need
101: which has the force of law to assume something without which that
102: cannot be which we must inevitably set before us as the aim of our
103: action.

108: 
109: * Lest any one should imagine that he finds an inconsistency here
110: when I call freedom the condition of the moral law, and hereafter
111: maintain in the treatise itself that the moral law is the condition
112: under which we can first become conscious of freedom, I will merely
113: remark that freedom is the ratio essendi of the moral law, while the
114: moral law is the ratio cognoscendi of freedom. For had not the moral
115: law been previously distinctly thought in our reason, we should
116: never consider ourselves justified in assuming such a thing as
117: freedom, although it be not contradictory. But were there no freedom
118: it would be impossible to trace the moral law in ourselves at all.
119: 
120: 
121: 
122: It would certainly be more satisfactory to our speculative reason if
123: it could solve these problems for itself without this circuit and
124: preserve the solution for practical use as a thing to be referred
125: to, but in fact our faculty of speculation is not so well provided.
126: Those who boast of such high knowledge ought not to keep it back,
127: but to exhibit it publicly that it may be tested and appreciated. They
128: want to prove: very good, let them prove; and the critical
129: philosophy lays its arms at their feet as the victors. Quid statis?
130: Nolint. Atqui licet esse beatis. As they then do not in fact choose to
131: do so, probably because they cannot, we must take up these arms
132: again in order to seek in the mortal use of reason, and to base on
133: this, the notions of God, freedom, and immortality, the possibility of
134: which speculation cannot adequately prove.
135: 
136: Here first is explained the enigma of the critical philosophy, viz.:
137: how we deny objective reality to the supersensible use of the
138: categories in speculation and yet admit this reality with respect to
139: the objects of pure practical reason. This must at first seem
140: inconsistent as long as this practical use is only nominally known.
141: But when, by a thorough analysis of it, one becomes aware that the
142: reality spoken of does not imply any theoretical determination of
143: the categories and extension of our knowledge to the supersensible;
144: but that what is meant is that in this respect an object belongs to
145: them, because either they are contained in the necessary determination
146: of the will a priori, or are inseparably connected with its object;
147: then this inconsistency disappears, because the use we make of these
148: concepts is different from what speculative reason requires. On the
149: other hand, there now appears an unexpected and very satisfactory
150: proof of the consistency of the speculative critical philosophy. For
151: whereas it insisted that the objects of experience as such,
152: including our own subject, have only the value of phenomena, while
153: at the same time things in themselves must be supposed as their basis,
154: so that not everything supersensible was to be regarded as a fiction
155: and its concept as empty; so now practical reason itself, without
156: any concert with the speculative, assures reality to a supersensible
157: object of the category of causality, viz., freedom, although (as
158: becomes a practical concept) only for practical use; and this
159: establishes on the evidence of a fact that which in the former case
160: could only be conceived. By this the strange but certain doctrine of
161: the speculative critical philosophy, that the thinking subject is to
162: itself in internal intuition only a phenomenon, obtains in the
163: critical examination of the practical reason its full confirmation,
164: and that so thoroughly that we should be compelled to adopt this
165: doctrine, even if the former had never proved it at all. *

169:                                                    {PREFACE ^paragraph 10}
170: 
171: * The union of causality as freedom with causality as rational
172: mechanism, the former established by the moral law, the latter by
173: the law of nature in the same subject, namely, man, is impossible,
174: unless we conceive him with reference to the former as a being in
175: himself, and with reference to the latter as a phenomenon- the
176: former in pure consciousness, the latter in empirical consciousness.
177: Otherwise reason inevitably contradicts itself.
178: 
179: 
180: 
181: By this also I can understand why the most considerable objections
182: which I have as yet met with against the Critique turn about these two
183: points, namely, on the one side, the objective reality of the
184: categories as applied to noumena, which is in the theoretical
185: department of knowledge denied, in the practical affirmed; and on
186: the other side, the paradoxical demand to regard oneself qua subject
187: of freedom as a noumenon, and at the same time from the point of
188: view of physical nature as a phenomenon in one's own empirical
189: consciousness; for as long as one has formed no definite notions of
190: morality and freedom, one could not conjecture on the one side what
191: was intended to be the noumenon, the basis of the alleged
192: phenomenon, and on the other side it seemed doubtful whether it was at
193: all possible to form any notion of it, seeing that we had previously
194: assigned all the notions of the pure understanding in its
195: theoretical use exclusively to phenomena. Nothing but a detailed
196: criticism of the practical reason can remove all this
197: misapprehension and set in a clear light the consistency which
198: constitutes its greatest merit.
199: 
200: So much by way of justification of the proceeding by which, in
201: this work, the notions and principles of pure speculative reason which
202: have already undergone their special critical examination are, now and
203: then, again subjected to examination. This would not in other cases be
204: in accordance with the systematic process by which a science is
205: established, since matters which have been decided ought only to be
206: cited and not again discussed. In this case, however, it was not
207: only allowable but necessary, because reason is here considered in
208: transition to a different use of these concepts from what it had
209: made of them before. Such a transition necessitates a comparison of
210: the old and the new usage, in order to distinguish well the new path
211: from the old one and, at the same time, to allow their connection to
212: be observed. Accordingly considerations of this kind, including
213: those which are once more directed to the concept of freedom in the
214: practical use of the pure reason, must not be regarded as an
215: interpolation serving only to fill up the gaps in the critical
216: system of speculative reason (for this is for its own purpose
217: complete), or like the props and buttresses which in a hastily
218: constructed building are often added afterwards; but as true members
219: which make the connexion of the system plain, and show us concepts,
220: here presented as real, which there could only be presented
221: problematically. This remark applies especially to the concept of
222: freedom, respecting which one cannot but observe with surprise that so
223: many boast of being able to understand it quite well and to explain
224: its possibility, while they regard it only psychologically, whereas if
225: they had studied it in a transcendental point of view, they must
226: have recognized that it is not only indispensable as a problematical
227: concept, in the complete use of speculative reason, but also quite
228: incomprehensible; and if they afterwards came to consider its
229: practical use, they must needs have come to the very mode of
230: determining the principles of this, to which they are now so loth to
231: assent. The concept of freedom is the stone of stumbling for all
232: empiricists, but at the same time the key to the loftiest practical
233: principles for critical moralists, who perceive by its means that they
234: must necessarily proceed by a rational method. For this reason I beg
235: the reader not to pass lightly over what is said of this concept at
236: the end of the Analytic.
237: 
238: I must leave it to those who are acquainted with works of this
239: kind to judge whether such a system as that of the practical reason,
240: which is here developed from the critical examination of it, has
241: cost much or little trouble, especially in seeking not to miss the
242: true point of view from which the whole can be rightly sketched. It
243: presupposes, indeed, the Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of
244: Morals, but only in so far as this gives a preliminary acquaintance
245: with the principle of duty, and assigns and justifies a definite
246: formula thereof; in other respects it is independent. * It results
247: from the nature of this practical faculty itself that the complete
248: classification of all practical sciences cannot be added, as in the
249: critique of the speculative reason. For it is not possible to define
250: duties specially, as human duties, with a view to their
251: classification, until the subject of this definition (viz., man) is
252: known according to his actual nature, at least so far as is
253: necessary with respect to duty; this, however, does not belong to a
254: critical examination of the practical reason, the business of which is
255: only to assign in a complete manner the principles of its possibility,
256: extent, and limits, without special reference to human nature. The
257: classification then belongs to the system of science, not to the
258: system of criticism.

262: 
263: 
264: * A reviewer who wanted to find some fault with this work has hit
265: the truth better, perhaps, than he thought, when he says that no new
266: principle of morality is set forth in it, but only a new formula.
267: But who would think of introducing a new principle of all morality and
268: making himself as it were the first discoverer of it, just as if all
269: the world before him were ignorant what duty was or had been in
270: thorough-going error? But whoever knows of what importance to a
271: mathematician a formula is, which defines accurately what is to be
272: done to work a problem, will not think that a formula is insignificant
273: and useless which does the same for all duty in general.
274: 
275: 
276: 
277: In the second part of the Analytic I have given, as I trust, a
278: sufficient answer to the objection of a truth-loving and acute
279: critic * of the Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals- a
280: critic always worthy of respect- the objection, namely, that the
281: notion of good was not established before the moral principle, as he
282: thinks it ought to have been. *(2) I have also had regard to many of
283: the objections which have reached me from men who show that they have
284: at heart the discovery of the truth, and I shall continue to do so
285: (for those who have only their old system before their eyes, and who
286: have already settled what is to be approved or disapproved, do not
287: desire any explanation which might stand in the way of their own
288: private opinion.)

296: 
297: *(2) It might also have been objected to me that I have not first
298: defined the notion of the faculty of desire, or of the feeling of
299: Pleasure, although this reproach would be unfair, because this
300: definition might reasonably be presupposed as given in psychology.
301: However, the definition there given might be such as to found the
302: determination of the faculty of desire on the feeling of pleasure
303: (as is commonly done), and thus the supreme principle of practical
304: philosophy would be necessarily made empirical, which, however,
305: remains to be proved and in this critique is altogether refuted. It
306: will, therefore, give this definition here in such a manner as it
307: ought to be given, in order to leave this contested point open at
308: the beginning, as it should be. LIFE is the faculty a being has of
309: acting according to laws of the faculty of desire. The faculty of
310: DESIRE is the being's faculty of becoming by means of its ideas the
311: cause of the actual existence of the objects of these ideas.
312: PLEASURE is the idea of the agreement of the object, or the action
313: with the subjective conditions of life, i.e., with the faculty of
314: causality of an idea in respect of the actuality of its object (or
315: with the determination of the forces of the subject to action which
316: produces it). I have no further need for the purposes of this critique
317: of notions borrowed from psychology; the critique itself supplies
318: the rest. It is easily seen that the question whether the faculty of
319: desire is always based on pleasure, or whether under certain
320: conditions pleasure only follows the determination of desire, is by
321: this definition left undecided, for it is composed only of terms
322: belonging to the pure understanding, i.e., of categories which contain
323: nothing empirical. Such precaution is very desirable in all philosophy
324: and yet is often neglected; namely, not to prejudge questions by
325: adventuring definitions before the notion has been completely
326: analysed, which is often very late. It may be observed through the
327: whole course of the critical philosophy (of the theoretical as well as
328: the practical reason) that frequent opportunity offers of supplying
329: defects in the old dogmatic method of philosophy, and of correcting
330: errors which are not observed until we make such rational use of these
331: notions viewing them as a whole.
332: 
333: 
334: 
335: When we have to study a particular faculty of the human mind in
336: its sources, its content, and its limits; then from the nature of
337: human knowledge we must begin with its parts, with an accurate and
338: complete exposition of them; complete, namely, so far as is possible
339: in the present state of our knowledge of its elements. But there is
340: another thing to be attended to which is of a more philosophical and
341: architectonic character, namely, to grasp correctly the idea of the
342: whole, and from thence to get a view of all those parts as mutually
343: related by the aid of pure reason, and by means of their derivation
344: from the concept of the whole. This is only possible through the
345: most intimate acquaintance with the system; and those who find the
346: first inquiry too troublesome, and do not think it worth their while
347: to attain such an acquaintance, cannot reach the second stage, namely,
348: the general view, which is a synthetical return to that which had
349: previously been given analytically. It is no wonder then if they
350: find inconsistencies everywhere, although the gaps which these
351: indicate are not in the system itself, but in their own incoherent
352: train of thought.
353: 
354: I have no fear, as regards this treatise, of the reproach that I
355: wish to introduce a new language, since the sort of knowledge here
356: in question has itself somewhat of an everyday character. Nor even
357: in the case of the former critique could this reproach occur to anyone
358: who had thought it through and not merely turned over the leaves. To
359: invent new words where the language has no lack of expressions for
360: given notions is a childish effort to distinguish oneself from the
361: crowd, if not by new and true thoughts, yet by new patches on the
362: old garment. If, therefore, the readers of that work know any more
363: familiar expressions which are as suitable to the thought as those
364: seem to me to be, or if they think they can show the futility of these
365: thoughts themselves and hence that of the expression, they would, in
366: the first case, very much oblige me, for I only desire to be
367: understood: and, in the second case, they would deserve well of
368: philosophy. But, as long as these thoughts stand, I very much doubt
369: that suitable and yet more common expressions for them can be found. *
370: 
371:                                                    {PREFACE ^paragraph 25}
372: 
373: 
374: 
375: * I am more afraid in the present treatise of occasional
376: misconception in respect of some expressions which I have chosen
377: with the greatest care in order that the notion to which they point
378: may not be missed. Thus, in the table of categories of the Practical
379: reason under the title of Modality, the Permitted, and forbidden (in a
380: practical objective point of view, possible and impossible) have
381: almost the same meaning in common language as the next category,
382: duty and contrary to duty. Here, however, the former means what
383: coincides with, or contradicts, a merely possible practical precept
384: (for example, the solution of all problems of geometry and mechanics);
385: the latter, what is similarly related to a law actually present in the
386: reason; and this distinction is not quite foreign even to common
387: language, although somewhat unusual. For example, it is forbidden to
388: an orator, as such, to forge new words or constructions; in a
389: certain degree this is permitted to a poet; in neither case is there
390: any question of duty. For if anyone chooses to forfeit his
391: reputation as an orator, no one can prevent him. We have here only
392: to do with the distinction of imperatives into problematical,
393: assertorial, and apodeictic. Similarly in the note in which I have
394: pared the moral ideas of practical perfection in different
395: philosophical schools, I have distinguished the idea of wisdom from
396: that of holiness, although I have stated that essentially and
397: objectively they are the same. But in that place I understand by the
398: former only that wisdom to which man (the Stoic) lays claim; therefore
399: I take it subjectively as an attribute alleged to belong to man.
400: (Perhaps the expression virtue, with which also the Stoic made great show,
401: would better mark the characteristic of his school.) The expression of
402: a postulate of pure practical reason might give most occasion to
403: misapprehension in case the reader confounded it with the
404: signification of the postulates in pure mathematics, which carry
405: apodeictic certainty with them. These, however, postulate the
406: possibility of an action, the object of which has been previously
407: recognized a priori in theory as possible, and that with perfect
408: certainty. But the former postulates the possibility of an object
409: itself (God and the immortality of the soul) from apodeictic practical
410: laws, and therefore only for the purposes of a practical reason.
411: This certainty of the postulated possibility then is not at all
412: theoretic, and consequently not apodeictic; that is to say, it is
413: not a known necessity as regards the object, but a necessary
414: supposition as regards the subject, necessary for the obedience to its
415: objective but practical laws. It is, therefore, merely a necessary
416: hypothesis. I could find no better expression for this rational
417: necessity, which is subjective, but yet true and unconditional.
418: 
419: 
420: 
421: In this manner, then, the a priori principles of two faculties of
422: the mind, the faculty of cognition and that of desire, would be
423: found and determined as to the conditions, extent, and limits of their
424: use, and thus a sure foundation be paid for a scientific system of
425: philosophy, both theoretic and practical.
426: 
427: Nothing worse could happen to these labours than that anyone
428: should make the unexpected discovery that there neither is, nor can
429: be, any a priori knowledge at all. But there is no danger of this.
430: This would be the same thing as if one sought to prove by reason
431: that there is no reason. For we only say that we know something by
432: reason, when we are conscious that we could have known it, even if
433: it had not been given to us in experience; hence rational knowledge
434: and knowledge a priori are one and the same. It is a clear
435: contradiction to try to extract necessity from a principle of
436: experience (ex pumice aquam), and to try by this to give a judgement
437: true universality (without which there is no rational inference, not
438: even inference from analogy, which is at least a presumed universality
439: and objective necessity). To substitute subjective necessity, that is,
440: custom, for objective, which exists only in a priori judgements, is to
441: deny to reason the power of judging about the object, i.e., of knowing
442: it, and what belongs to it. It implies, for example, that we must
443: not say of something which often or always follows a certain
444: antecedent state that we can conclude from this to that (for this
445: would imply objective necessity and the notion of an a priori
446: connexion), but only that we may expect similar cases (just as animals
447: do), that is that we reject the notion of cause altogether as false
448: and a mere delusion. As to attempting to remedy this want of objective
449: and consequently universal validity by saying that we can see no
450: ground for attributing any other sort of knowledge to other rational
451: beings, if this reasoning were valid, our ignorance would do more
452: for the enlargement of our knowledge than all our meditation. For,
453: then, on this very ground that we have no knowledge of any other
454: rational beings besides man, we should have a right to suppose them to
455: be of the same nature as we know ourselves to be: that is, we should
456: really know them. I omit to mention that universal assent does not
457: prove the objective validity of a judgement (i.e., its validity as a
458: cognition), and although this universal assent should accidentally
459: happen, it could furnish no proof of agreement with the object; on the
460: contrary, it is the objective validity which alone constitutes the
461: basis of a necessary universal consent.

464: 
465: Hume would be quite satisfied with this system of universal
466: empiricism, for, as is well known, he desired nothing more than
467: that, instead of ascribing any objective meaning to the necessity in
468: the concept of cause, a merely subjective one should be assumed, viz.,
469: custom, in order to deny that reason could judge about God, freedom,
470: and immortality; and if once his principles were granted, he was
471: certainly well able to deduce his conclusions therefrom, with all
472: logical coherence. But even Hume did not make his empiricism so
473: universal as to include mathematics. He holds the principles of
474: mathematics to be analytical; and if his were correct, they would
475: certainly be apodeictic also: but we could not infer from this that
476: reason has the faculty of forming apodeictic judgements in
477: philosophy also- that is to say, those which are synthetical
478: judgements, like the judgement of causality. But if we adopt a
479: universal empiricism, then mathematics will be included.
480: 
481: Now if this science is in contradiction with a reason that admits
482: only empirical principles, as it inevitably is in the antinomy in
483: which mathematics prove the infinite divisibility of space, which
484: empiricism cannot admit; then the greatest possible evidence of
485: demonstration is in manifest contradiction with the alleged
486: conclusions from experience, and we are driven to ask, like
487: Cheselden's blind patient, "Which deceives me, sight or touch?" (for
488: empiricism is based on a necessity felt, rationalism on a necessity
489: seen). And thus universal empiricism reveals itself as absolute
490: scepticism. It is erroneous to attribute this in such an unqualified
491: sense to Hume, * since he left at least one certain touchstone (which
492: can only be found in a priori principles), although experience
493: consists not only of feelings, but also of judgements.
494: 
495: 
496: 
497: * Names that designate the followers of a sect have always been
498: accompanied with much injustice; just as if one said, "N is an
499: Idealist." For although he not only admits, but even insists, that our
500: ideas of external things have actual objects of external things
501: corresponding to them, yet he holds that the form of the intuition
502: does not depend on them but on the human mind.

508: However, as in this philosophical and critical age such empiricism
509: can scarcely be serious, and it is probably put forward only as an
510: intellectual exercise and for the purpose of putting in a clearer
511: light, by contrast, the necessity of rational a priori principles,
512: we can only be grateful to those who employ themselves in this
513: otherwise uninstructive labour.

519: 
520: 
521:      Of the Idea of a Critique of Practical Reason.
522: 
523: 
524: 
525: The theoretical use of reason was concerned with objects of the
526: cognitive faculty only, and a critical examination of it with
527: reference to this use applied properly only to the pure faculty of
528: cognition; because this raised the suspicion, which was afterwards
529: confirmed, that it might easily pass beyond its limits, and be lost
530: among unattainable objects, or even contradictory notions. It is quite
531: different with the practical use of reason. In this, reason is
532: concerned with the grounds of determination of the will, which is a
533: faculty either to produce objects corresponding to ideas, or to
534: determine ourselves to the effecting of such objects (whether the
535: physical power is sufficient or not); that is, to determine our
536: causality. For here, reason can at least attain so far as to determine
537: the will, and has always objective reality in so far as it is the
538: volition only that is in question. The first question here then is
539: whether pure reason of itself alone suffices to determine the will, or
540: whether it can be a ground of determination only as dependent on
541: empirical conditions. Now, here there comes in a notion of causality
542: justified by the critique of the pure reason, although not capable
543: of being presented empirically, viz., that of freedom; and if we can
544: now discover means of proving that this property does in fact belong
545: to the human will (and so to the will of all rational beings), then it
546: will not only be shown that pure reason can be practical, but that
547: it alone, and not reason empirically limited, is indubitably
548: practical; consequently, we shall have to make a critical examination,
549: not of pure practical reason, but only of practical reason
550: generally. For when once pure reason is shown to exist, it needs no
551: critical examination. For reason itself contains the standard for
552: the critical examination of every use of it. The critique, then, of
553: practical reason generally is bound to prevent the empirically
554: conditioned reason from claiming exclusively to furnish the ground
555: of determination of the will. If it is proved that there is a
556: [practical] reason, its employment is alone immanent; the
557: empirically conditioned use, which claims supremacy, is on the
558: contrary transcendent and expresses itself in demands and precepts
559: which go quite beyond its sphere. This is just the opposite of what
560: might be said of pure reason in its speculative employment.
561: 
562: However, as it is still pure reason, the knowledge of which is
563: here the foundation of its practical employment, the general outline
564: of the classification of a critique of practical reason must be
565: arranged in accordance with that of the speculative. We must, then,
566: have the Elements and the Methodology of it; and in the former an
567: Analytic as the rule of truth, and a Dialectic as the exposition and
568: dissolution of the illusion in the judgements of practical reason. But
569: the order in the subdivision of the Analytic will be the reverse of
570: that in the critique of the pure speculative reason. For, in the
571: present case, we shall commence with the principles and proceed to the
572: concepts, and only then, if possible, to the senses; whereas in the
573: case of the speculative reason we began with the senses and had to end
574: with the principles. The reason of this lies again in this: that now
575: we have to do with a will, and have to consider reason, not in its
576: relation to objects, but to this will and its causality. We must,
577: then, begin with the principles of a causality not empirically
578: conditioned, after which the attempt can be made to establish our
579: notions of the determining grounds of such a will, of their
580: application to objects, and finally to the subject and its sense
581: faculty. We necessarily begin with the law of causality from
582: freedom, that is, with a pure practical principle, and this determines
583: the objects to which alone it can be applied.

605:                     I. DEFINITION.
606: 
607: 
608: 
609: Practical principles are propositions which contain a general
610: determination of the will, having under it several practical rules.
611: They are subjective, or maxims, when the condition is regarded by
612: the subject as valid only for his own will, but are objective, or
613: practical laws, when the condition is recognized as objective, that
614: is, valid for the will of every rational being.
615: 
616: 
617:

619: 
620:                        REMARK.
621: 
622: 
623: 
624: Supposing that pure reason contains in itself a practical motive,
625: that is, one adequate to determine the will, then there are
626: practical laws; otherwise all practical principles will be mere
627: maxims. In case the will of a rational being is pathologically
628: affected, there may occur a conflict of the maxims with the
629: practical laws recognized by itself. For example, one may make it
630: his maxim to let no injury pass unrevenged, and yet he may see that
631: this is not a practical law, but only his own maxim; that, on the
632: contrary, regarded as being in one and the same maxim a rule for the
633: will of every rational being, it must contradict itself. In natural
634: philosophy the principles of what happens, (e.g., the principle of
635: equality of action and reaction in the communication of motion) are at
636: the same time laws of nature; for the use of reason there is
637: theoretical and determined by the nature of the object. In practical
638: philosophy, i.e., that which has to do only with the grounds of
639: determination of the will, the principles which a man makes for
640: himself are not laws by which one is inevitably bound; because
641: reason in practical matters has to do with the subject, namely, with
642: the faculty of desire, the special character of which may occasion
643: variety in the rule. The practical rule is always a product of reason,
644: because it prescribes action as a means to the effect. But in the case
645: of a being with whom reason does not of itself determine the will,
646: this rule is an imperative, i.e., a rule characterized by "shall,"
647: which expresses the objective necessitation of the action and
648: signifies that, if reason completely determined the will, the action
649: would inevitably take place according to this rule. Imperatives,
650: therefore, are objectively valid, and are quite distinct from
651: maxims, which are subjective principles. The former either determine
652: the conditions of the causality of the rational being as an
653: efficient cause, i.e., merely in reference to the effect and the means
654: of attaining it; or they determine the will only, whether it is
655: adequate to the effect or not. The former would be hypothetical
656: imperatives, and contain mere precepts of skill; the latter, on the
657: contrary, would be categorical, and would alone be practical laws.
658: Thus maxims are principles, but not imperatives. Imperatives
659: themselves, however, when they are conditional (i.e., do not determine
660: the will simply as will, but only in respect to a desired effect, that
661: is, when they are hypothetical imperatives), are practical precepts
662: but not laws. Laws must be sufficient to determine the will as will,
663: even before I ask whether I have power sufficient for a desired
664: effect, or the means necessary to produce it; hence they are
665: categorical: otherwise they are not laws at all, because the necessity
666: is wanting, which, if it is to be practical, must be independent of
667: conditions which are pathological and are therefore only
668: contingently connected with the will. Tell a man, for example, that he
669: must be industrious and thrifty in youth, in order that he may not
670: want in old age; this is a correct and important practical precept
671: of the will. But it is easy to see that in this case the will is
672: directed to something else which it is presupposed that it desires;
673: and as to this desire, we must leave it to the actor himself whether
674: he looks forward to other resources than those of his own acquisition,
675: or does not expect to be old, or thinks that in case of future
676: necessity he will be able to make shift with little. Reason, from
677: which alone can spring a rule involving necessity, does, indeed,
678: give necessity to this precept (else it would not be an imperative),
679: but this is a necessity dependent on subjective conditions, and cannot
680: be supposed in the same degree in all subjects. But that reason may
681: give laws it is necessary that it should only need to presuppose
682: itself, because rules are objectively and universally valid only
683: when they hold without any contingent subjective conditions, which
684: distinguish one rational being from another. Now tell a man that he
685: should never make a deceitful promise, this is a rule which only
686: concerns his will, whether the purposes he may have can be attained
687: thereby or not; it is the volition only which is to be determined a
688: priori by that rule. If now it is found that this rule is
689: practically right, then it is a law, because it is a categorical
690: imperative. Thus, practical laws refer to the will only, without
691: considering what is attained by its causality, and we may disregard
692: this latter (as belonging to the world of sense) in order to have them
693: quite pure.

700: 
701: 
702: 
703: All practical principles which presuppose an object (matter) of
704: the faculty of desire as the ground of determination of the will are
705: empirical and can furnish no practical laws.
706: 
707: By the matter of the faculty of desire I mean an object the
708: realization of which is desired. Now, if the desire for this object
709: precedes the practical rule and is the condition of our making it a
710: principle, then I say (in the first place) this principle is in that
711: case wholly empirical, for then what determines the choice is the idea
712: of an object and that relation of this idea to the subject by which
713: its faculty of desire is determined to its realization. Such a
714: relation to the subject is called the pleasure in the realization of
715: an object. This, then, must be presupposed as a condition of the
716: possibility of determination of the will. But it is impossible to know
717: a priori of any idea of an object whether it will be connected with
718: pleasure or pain, or be indifferent. In such cases, therefore, the
719: determining principle of the choice must be empirical and,
720: therefore, also the practical material principle which presupposes
721: it as a condition.
722: 
723: In the second place, since susceptibility to a pleasure or pain
724: can be known only empirically and cannot hold in the same degree for
725: all rational beings, a principle which is based on this subjective
726: condition may serve indeed as a maxim for the subject which
727: possesses this susceptibility, but not as a law even to him (because
728: it is wanting in objective necessity, which must be recognized a
729: priori); it follows, therefore, that such a principle can never
730: furnish a practical law.
731: 
732: 
733:

735: 
736:                    III. THEOREM II.
737: 
738: 
739: 
740: All material practical principles as such are of one and the same
741: kind and come under the general principle of self-love or private
742: happiness.
743: 
744: Pleasure arising from the idea of the idea of the existence of a
745: thing, in so far as it is to determine the desire of this thing, is
746: founded on the susceptibility of the subject, since it depends on
747: the presence of an object; hence it belongs to sense (feeling), and
748: not to understanding, which expresses a relation of the idea to an
749: object according to concepts, not to the subject according to
750: feelings. It is, then, practical only in so far as the faculty of
751: desire is determined by the sensation of agreeableness which the
752: subject expects from the actual existence of the object. Now, a
753: rational being's consciousness of the pleasantness of life
754: uninterruptedly accompanying his whole existence is happiness; and the
755: principle which makes this the supreme ground of determination of
756: the will is the principle of self-love. All material principles, then,
757: which place the determining ground of the will in the pleasure or pain
758: to be received from the existence of any object are all of the same
759: kind, inasmuch as they all belong to the principle of self-love or
760: private happiness.

766:                       COROLLARY.
767: 
768: 
769: 
770: All material practical rules place the determining principle of
771: the will in the lower desires; and if there were no purely formal laws
772: of the will adequate to determine it, then we could not admit any
773: higher desire at all.

779:                                           {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 30}
780: 
781: 
782: 
783: It is surprising that men, otherwise acute, can think it possible to
784: distinguish between higher and lower desires, according as the ideas
785: which are connected with the feeling of pleasure have their origin
786: in the senses or in the understanding; for when we inquire what are
787: the determining grounds of desire, and place them in some expected
788: pleasantness, it is of no consequence whence the idea of this pleasing
789: object is derived, but only how much it pleases. Whether an idea has
790: its seat and source in the understanding or not, if it can only
791: determine the choice by presupposing a feeling of pleasure in the
792: subject, it follows that its capability of determining the choice
793: depends altogether on the nature of the inner sense, namely, that this
794: can be agreeably affected by it. However dissimilar ideas of objects
795: may be, though they be ideas of the understanding, or even of the
796: reason in contrast to ideas of sense, yet the feeling of pleasure,
797: by means of which they constitute the determining principle of the
798: will (the expected satisfaction which impels the activity to the
799: production of the object), is of one and the same kind, not only
800: inasmuch as it can only be known empirically, but also inasmuch as
801: it affects one and the same vital force which manifests itself in
802: the faculty of desire, and in this respect can only differ in degree
803: from every other ground of determination. Otherwise, how could we
804: compare in respect of magnitude two principles of determination, the
805: ideas of which depend upon different faculties, so as to prefer that
806: which affects the faculty of desire in the highest degree. The same
807: man may return unread an instructive book which he cannot again
808: obtain, in order not to miss a hunt; he may depart in the midst of a
809: fine speech, in order not to be late for dinner; he may leave a
810: rational conversation, such as he otherwise values highly, to take his
811: place at the gaming-table; he may even repulse a poor man whom he at
812: other times takes pleasure in benefiting, because he has only just
813: enough money in his pocket to pay for his admission to the theatre. If
814: the determination of his will rests on the feeling of the
815: agreeableness or disagreeableness that he expects from any cause, it
816: is all the same to him by what sort of ideas he will be affected.
817: The only thing that concerns him, in order to decide his choice, is,
818: how great, how long continued, how easily obtained, and how often
819: repeated, this agreeableness is. Just as to the man who wants money to
820: spend, it is all the same whether the gold was dug out of the mountain
821: or washed out of the sand, provided it is everywhere accepted at the
822: same value; so the man who cares only for the enjoyment of life does
823: not ask whether the ideas are of the understanding or the senses,
824: but only how much and how great pleasure they will give for the
825: longest time. It is only those that would gladly deny to pure reason
826: the power of determining the will, without the presupposition of any
827: feeling, who could deviate so far from their own exposition as to
828: describe as quite heterogeneous what they have themselves previously
829: brought under one and the same principle. Thus, for example, it is
830: observed that we can find pleasure in the mere exercise of power, in
831: the consciousness of our strength of mind in overcoming obstacles
832: which are opposed to our designs, in the culture of our mental
833: talents, etc.; and we justly call these more refined pleasures and
834: enjoyments, because they are more in our power than others; they do
835: not wear out, but rather increase the capacity for further enjoyment
836: of them, and while they delight they at the same time cultivate. But
837: to say on this account that they determine the will in a different way
838: and not through sense, whereas the possibility of the pleasure
839: presupposes a feeling for it implanted in us, which is the first
840: condition of this satisfaction; this is just as when ignorant
841: persons that like to dabble in metaphysics imagine matter so subtle,
842: so supersubtle that they almost make themselves giddy with it, and
843: then think that in this way they have conceived it as a spiritual
844: and yet extended being. If with Epicurus we make virtue determine
845: the will only by means of the pleasure it promises, we cannot
846: afterwards blame him for holding that this pleasure is of the same
847: kind as those of the coarsest senses. For we have no reason whatever
848: to charge him with holding that the ideas by which this feeling is
849: excited in us belong merely to the bodily senses. As far as can be
850: conjectured, he sought the source of many of them in the use of the
851: higher cognitive faculty, but this did not prevent him, and could
852: not prevent him, from holding on the principle above stated, that
853: the pleasure itself which those intellectual ideas give us, and by
854: which alone they can determine the will, is just of the same kind.
855: Consistency is the highest obligation of a philosopher, and yet the
856: most rarely found. The ancient Greek schools give us more examples
857: of it than we find in our syncretistic age, in which a certain shallow
858: and dishonest system of compromise of contradictory principles is
859: devised, because it commends itself better to a public which is
860: content to know something of everything and nothing thoroughly, so
861: as to please every party.
862: 
863: The principle of private happiness, however much understanding and
864: reason may be used in it, cannot contain any other determining
865: principles for the will than those which belong to the lower
866: desires; and either there are no [higher] desires at all, or pure
867: reason must of itself alone be practical; that is, it must be able
868: to determine the will by the mere form of the practical rule without
869: supposing any feeling, and consequently without any idea of the
870: pleasant or unpleasant, which is the matter of the desire, and which
871: is always an empirical condition of the principles. Then only, when
872: reason of itself determines the will (not as the servant of the
873: inclination), it is really a higher desire to which that which is
874: pathologically determined is subordinate, and is really, and even
875: specifically, distinct from the latter, so that even the slightest
876: admixture of the motives of the latter impairs its strength and
877: superiority; just as in a mathematical demonstration the least
878: empirical condition would degrade and destroy its force and value.
879: Reason, with its practical law, determines the will immediately, not
880: by means of an intervening feeling of pleasure or pain, not even of
881: pleasure in the law itself, and it is only because it can, as pure
882: reason, be practical, that it is possible for it to be legislative.

891: 
892: To be happy is necessarily the wish of every finite rational
893: being, and this, therefore, is inevitably a determining principle of
894: its faculty of desire. For we are not in possession originally of
895: satisfaction with our whole existence- a bliss which would imply a
896: consciousness of our own independent self-sufficiency this is a
897: problem imposed upon us by our own finite nature, because we have
898: wants and these wants regard the matter of our desires, that is,
899: something that is relative to a subjective feeling of pleasure or
900: pain, which determines what we need in order to be satisfied with
901: our condition. But just because this material principle of
902: determination can only be empirically known by the subject, it is
903: impossible to regard this problem as a law; for a law being
904: objective must contain the very same principle of determination of the
905: will in all cases and for all rational beings. For, although the
906: notion of happiness is in every case the foundation of practical
907: relation of the objects to the desires, yet it is only a general
908: name for the subjective determining principles, and determines nothing
909: specifically; whereas this is what alone we are concerned with in this
910: practical problem, which cannot be solved at all without such specific
911: determination. For it is every man's own special feeling of pleasure
912: and pain that decides in what he is to place his happiness, and even
913: in the same subject this will vary with the difference of his wants
914: according as this feeling changes, and thus a law which is
915: subjectively necessary (as a law of nature) is objectively a very
916: contingent practical principle, which can and must be very different
917: in different subjects and therefore can never furnish a law; since, in
918: the desire for happiness it is not the form (of conformity to law)
919: that is decisive, but simply the matter, namely, whether I am to
920: expect pleasure in following the law, and how much. Principles of
921: self-love may, indeed, contain universal precepts of skill (how to
922: find means to accomplish one's purpose), but in that case they are
923: merely theoretical principles; * as, for example, how he who would
924: like to eat bread should contrive a mill; but practical precepts
925: founded on them can never be universal, for the determining principle
926: of the desire is based on the feeling pleasure and pain, which can
927: never be supposed to be universally directed to the same objects.
928: 
929: 
930: 
931: * Propositions which in mathematics or physics are called practical
932: ought properly to be called technical. For they have nothing to do
933: with the determination of the will; they only point out how a certain
934: effect is to be produced and are, therefore, just as theoretical as
935: any propositions which express the connection of a cause with an
936: effect. Now whoever chooses the effect must also choose the cause.

941: 
942: Even supposing, however, that all finite rational beings were
943: thoroughly agreed as to what were the objects of their feelings of
944: pleasure and pain, and also as to the means which they must employ
945: to attain the one and avoid the other; still, they could by no means
946: set up the principle of self-love as a practical law, for this
947: unanimity itself would be only contingent. The principle of
948: determination would still be only subjectively valid and merely
949: empirical, and would not possess the necessity which is conceived in
950: every law, namely, an objective necessity arising from a priori
951: grounds; unless, indeed, we hold this necessity to be not at all
952: practical, but merely physical, viz., that our action is as inevitably
953: determined by our inclination, as yawning when we see others yawn.
954: It would be better to maintain that there are no practical laws at
955: all, but only counsels for the service of our desires, than to raise
956: merely subjective principles to the rank of practical laws, which have
957: objective necessity, and not merely subjective, and which must be
958: known by reason a priori, not by experience (however empirically
959: universal this may be). Even the rules of corresponding phenomena
960: are only called laws of nature (e.g., the mechanical laws), when we
961: either know them really a priori, or (as in the case of chemical laws)
962: suppose that they would be known a priori from objective grounds if
963: our insight reached further. But in the case of merely subjective
964: practical principles, it is expressly made a condition that they rest,
965: not on objective, but on subjective conditions of choice, and hence
966: that they must always be represented as mere maxims, never as
967: practical laws. This second remark seems at first sight to be mere
968: verbal refinement, but it defines the terms of the most important
969: distinction which can come into consideration in practical
970: investigations.

975: 
976: 
977: 
978: A rational being cannot regard his maxims as practical universal
979: laws, unless he conceives them as principles which determine the will,
980: not by their matter, but by their form only.

983: 
984: By the matter of a practical principle I mean the object of the
985: will. This object is either the determining ground of the will or it
986: is not. In the former case the rule of the will is subjected to an
987: empirical condition (viz., the relation of the determining idea to the
988: feeling of pleasure and pain), consequently it can not be a
989: practical law. Now, when we abstract from a law all matter, i.e.,
990: every object of the will (as a determining principle), nothing is left
991: but the mere form of a universal legislation. Therefore, either a
992: rational being cannot conceive his subjective practical principles,
993: that is, his maxims, as being at the same time universal laws, or he
994: must suppose that their mere form, by which they are fitted for
995: universal legislation, is alone what makes them practical laws.

1001: 
1002: 
1003: The commonest understanding can distinguish without instruction what
1004: form of maxim is adapted for universal legislation, and what is not.
1005: Suppose, for example, that I have made it my maxim to increase my
1006: fortune by every safe means. Now, I have a deposit in my hands, the
1007: owner of which is dead and has left no writing about it. This is
1008: just the case for my maxim. I desire then to know whether that maxim
1009: can also bold good as a universal practical law. I apply it,
1010: therefore, to the present case, and ask whether it could take the form
1011: of a law, and consequently whether I can by my maxim at the same
1012: time give such a law as this, that everyone may deny a deposit of
1013: which no one can produce a proof. I at once become aware that such a
1014: principle, viewed as a law, would annihilate itself, because the
1015: result would be that there would be no deposits. A practical law which
1016: I recognise as such must be qualified for universal legislation;
1017: this is an identical proposition and, therefore, self-evident. Now, if
1018: I say that my will is subject to a practical law, I cannot adduce my
1019: inclination (e.g., in the present case my avarice) as a principle of
1020: determination fitted to be a universal practical law; for this is so
1021: far from being fitted for a universal legislation that, if put in
1022: the form of a universal law, it would destroy itself.

1024:                                           {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 50}
1025: 
1026: It is, therefore, surprising that intelligent men could have thought
1027: of calling the desire of happiness a universal practical law on the
1028: ground that the desire is universal, and, therefore, also the maxim by
1029: which everyone makes this desire determine his will. For whereas in
1030: other cases a universal law of nature makes everything harmonious;
1031: here, on the contrary, if we attribute to the maxim the universality
1032: of a law, the extreme opposite of harmony will follow, the greatest
1033: opposition and the complete destruction of the maxim itself and its
1034: purpose. For, in that case, the will of all has not one and the same
1035: object, but everyone has his own (his private welfare), which may
1036: accidentally accord with the purposes of others which are equally
1037: selfish, but it is far from sufficing for a law; because the
1038: occasional exceptions which one is permitted to make are endless,
1039: and cannot be definitely embraced in one universal rule. In this
1040: manner, then, results a harmony like that which a certain satirical
1041: poem depicts as existing between a married couple bent on going to
1042: ruin, "O, marvellous harmony, what he wishes, she wishes also"; or
1043: like what is said of the pledge of Francis I to the Emperor Charles V,
1044: "What my brother Charles wishes that I wish also" (viz., Milan).
1045: Empirical principles of determination are not fit for any universal
1046: external legislation, but just as little for internal; for each man
1047: makes his own subject the foundation of his inclination, and in the
1048: same subject sometimes one inclination, sometimes another, has the
1049: preponderance. To discover a law which would govern them all under
1050: this condition, namely, bringing them all into harmony, is quite
1051: impossible.

1057: 
1058: 
1059: Supposing that the mere legislative form of maxims is alone the
1060: sufficient determining principle of a will, to find the nature of
1061: the will which can be determined by it alone.

1064: 
1065:  Since the bare form of the law can only be conceived by reason, and
1066: is, therefore, not an object of the senses, and consequently does
1067: not belong to the class of phenomena, it follows that the idea of
1068: it, which determines the will, is distinct from all the principles
1069: that determine events in nature according to the law of causality,
1070: because in their case the determining principles must themselves be
1071: phenomena. Now, if no other determining principle can serve as a law
1072: for the will except that universal legislative form, such a will
1073: must be conceived as quite independent of the natural law of phenomena
1074: in their mutual relation, namely, the law of causality; such
1075: independence is called freedom in the strictest, that is, in the
1076: transcendental, sense; consequently, a will which can have its law
1077: in nothing but the mere legislative form of the maxim is a free will.

1089: 
1090: Since the matter of the practical law, i.e., an object of the maxim,
1091: can never be given otherwise than empirically, and the free will is
1092: independent on empirical conditions (that is, conditions belonging
1093: to the world of sense) and yet is determinable, consequently a free
1094: will must find its principle of determination in the law, and yet
1095: independently of the matter of the law. But, besides the matter of the
1096: law, nothing is contained in it except the legislative form. It is the
1097: legislative form, then, contained in the maxim, which can alone
1098: constitute a principle of determination of the [free] will.

1103: 
1104: 
1105: 
1106: Thus freedom and an unconditional practical law reciprocally imply
1107: each other. Now I do not ask here whether they are in fact distinct,
1108: or whether an unconditioned law is not rather merely the consciousness
1109: of a pure practical reason and the latter identical with the
1110: positive concept of freedom; I only ask, whence begins our knowledge
1111: of the unconditionally practical, whether it is from freedom or from
1112: the practical law? Now it cannot begin from freedom, for of this we
1113: cannot be immediately conscious, since the first concept of it is
1114: negative; nor can we infer it from experience, for experience gives us
1115: the knowledge only of the law of phenomena, and hence of the mechanism
1116: of nature, the direct opposite of freedom. It is therefore the moral
1117: law, of which we become directly conscious (as soon as we trace for
1118: ourselves maxims of the will), that first presents itself to us, and
1119: leads directly to the concept of freedom, inasmuch as reason
1120: presents it as a principle of determination not to be outweighed by
1121: any sensible conditions, nay, wholly independent of them. But how is
1122: the consciousness, of that moral law possible? We can become conscious
1123: of pure practical laws just as we are conscious of pure theoretical
1124: principles, by attending to the necessity with which reason prescribes
1125: them and to the elimination of all empirical conditions, which it
1126: directs. The concept of a pure will arises out of the former, as
1127: that of a pure understanding arises out of the latter. That this is
1128: the true subordination of our concepts, and that it is morality that
1129: first discovers to us the notion of freedom, hence that it is
1130: practical reason which, with this concept, first proposes to
1131: speculative reason the most insoluble problem, thereby placing it in
1132: the greatest perplexity, is evident from the following
1133: consideration: Since nothing in phenomena can be explained by the
1134: concept of freedom, but the mechanism of nature must constitute the
1135: only clue; moreover, when pure reason tries to ascend in the series of
1136: causes to the unconditioned, it falls into an antinomy which is
1137: entangled in incomprehensibilities on the one side as much as the
1138: other; whilst the latter (namely, mechanism) is at least useful in the
1139: explanation of phenomena, therefore no one would ever have been so
1140: rash as to introduce freedom into science, had not the moral law,
1141: and with it practical reason, come in and forced this notion upon
1142: us. Experience, however, confirms this order of notions. Suppose
1143: some one asserts of his lustful appetite that, when the desired object
1144: and the opportunity are present, it is quite irresistible. [Ask
1145: him]- if a gallows were erected before the house where he finds this
1146: opportunity, in order that he should be hanged thereon immediately
1147: after the gratification of his lust, whether he could not then control
1148: his passion; we need not be long in doubt what he would reply. Ask
1149: him, however- if his sovereign ordered him, on pain of the same
1150: immediate execution, to bear false witness against an honourable
1151: man, whom the prince might wish to destroy under a plausible
1152: pretext, would he consider it possible in that case to overcome his
1153: love of life, however great it may be. He would perhaps not venture to
1154: affirm whether he would do so or not, but he must unhesitatingly admit
1155: that it is possible to do so. He judges, therefore, that he can do a
1156: certain thing because he is conscious that he ought, and he recognizes
1157: that he is free- a fact which but for the moral law he would never
1158: have known.

1177: 
1178: 
1179: Pure geometry has postulates which are practical propositions, but
1180: contain nothing further than the assumption that we can do something
1181: if it is required that we should do it, and these are the only
1182: geometrical propositions that concern actual existence. They are,
1183: then, practical rules under a problematical condition of the will; but
1184: here the rule says: We absolutely must proceed in a certain manner.
1185: The practical rule is, therefore, unconditional, and hence it is
1186: conceived a priori as a categorically practical proposition by which
1187: the will is objectively determined absolutely and immediately (by
1188: the practical rule itself, which thus is in this case a law); for pure
1189: reason practical of itself is here directly legislative. The will is
1190: thought as independent on empirical conditions, and, therefore, as
1191: pure will determined by the mere form of the law, and this principle
1192: of determination is regarded as the supreme condition of all maxims.
1193: The thing is strange enough, and has no parallel in all the rest of
1194: our practical knowledge. For the a priori thought of a possible
1195: universal legislation which is therefore merely problematical, is
1196: unconditionally commanded as a law without borrowing anything from
1197: experience or from any external will. This, however, is not a
1198: precept to do something by which some desired effect can be attained
1199: (for then the will would depend on physical conditions), but a rule
1200: that determines the will a priori only so far as regards the forms
1201: of its maxims; and thus it is at least not impossible to conceive that
1202: a law, which only applies to the subjective form of principles, yet
1203: serves as a principle of determination by means of the objective
1204: form of law in general. We may call the consciousness of this
1205: fundamental law a fact of reason, because we cannot reason it out from
1206: antecedent data of reason, e.g., the consciousness of freedom (for
1207: this is not antecedently given), but it forces itself on us as a
1208: synthetic a priori proposition, which is not based on any intuition,
1209: either pure or empirical. It would, indeed, be analytical if the
1210: freedom of the will were presupposed, but to presuppose freedom as a
1211: positive concept would require an intellectual intuition, which cannot
1212: here be assumed; however, when we regard this law as given, it must be
1213: observed, in order not to fall into any misconception, that it is
1214: not an empirical fact, but the sole fact of the pure reason, which
1215: thereby announces itself as originally legislative (sic volo, sic

1237: The fact just mentioned is undeniable. It is only necessary to
1238: analyse the judgement that men pass on the lawfulness of their
1239: actions, in order to find that, whatever inclination may say to the
1240: contrary, reason, incorruptible and self-constrained, always
1241: confronts the maxim of the will in any action with the pure will, that
1242: is, with itself, considering itself as a priori practical. Now this
1243: principle of morality, just on account of the universality of the
1244: legislation which makes it the formal supreme determining principle of
1245: the will, without regard to any subjective differences, is declared by
1246: the reason to be a law for all rational beings, in so far as they have
1247: a will, that is, a power to determine their causality by the
1248: conception of rules; and, therefore, so far as they are capable of
1249: acting according to principles, and consequently also according to
1250: practical a priori principles (for these alone have the necessity that
1251: reason requires in a principle). It is, therefore, not limited to
1252: men only, but applies to all finite beings that possess reason and
1253: will; nay, it even includes the Infinite Being as the supreme
1254: intelligence. In the former case, however, the law has the form of
1255: an imperative, because in them, as rational beings, we can suppose a
1256: pure will, but being creatures affected with wants and physical
1257: motives, not a holy will, that is, one which would be incapable of any
1258: maxim conflicting with the moral law. In their case, therefore, the
1259: moral law is an imperative, which commands categorically, because
1260: the law is unconditioned; the relation of such a will to this law is
1261: dependence under the name of obligation, which implies a constraint to
1262: an action, though only by reason and its objective law; and this
1263: action is called duty, because an elective will, subject to
1264: pathological affections (though not determined by them, and,
1265: therefore, still free), implies a wish that arises from subjective
1266: causes and, therefore, may often be opposed to the pure objective
1267: determining principle; whence it requires the moral constraint of a
1268: resistance of the practical reason, which may be called an internal,
1269: but intellectual, compulsion. In the supreme intelligence the elective
1270: will is rightly conceived as incapable of any maxim which could not at
1271: the same time be objectively a law; and the notion of holiness,
1272: which on that account belongs to it, places it, not indeed above all
1273: practical laws, but above all practically restrictive laws, and
1274: consequently above obligation and duty. This holiness of will is,
1275: however, a practical idea, which must necessarily serve as a type to
1276: which finite rational beings can only approximate indefinitely, and
1277: which the pure moral law, which is itself on this account called holy,
1278: constantly and rightly holds before their eyes. The utmost that finite
1279: practical reason can effect is to be certain of this indefinite
1280: progress of one's maxims and of their steady disposition to advance.
1281: This is virtue, and virtue, at least as a naturally acquired
1282: faculty, can never be perfect, because assurance in such a case
1283: never becomes apodeictic certainty and, when it only amounts to
1284: persuasion, is very dangerous.

1289: 
1290: 
1291: 
1292: The autonomy of the will is the sole principle of all moral laws and
1293: of all duties which conform to them; on the other hand, heteronomy
1294: of the elective will not only cannot be the basis of any obligation,
1295: but is, on the contrary, opposed to the principle thereof and to the
1296: morality of the will.
1297: 
1298:                                           {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 85}
1299: 
1300: In fact the sole principle of morality consists in the
1301: independence on all matter of the law (namely, a desired object),
1302: and in the determination of the elective will by the mere universal
1303: legislative form of which its maxim must be capable. Now this
1304: independence is freedom in the negative sense, and this
1305: self-legislation of the pure, and therefore practical, reason is
1306: freedom in the positive sense. Thus the moral law expresses nothing
1307: else than the autonomy of the pure practical reason; that is, freedom;
1308: and this is itself the formal condition of all maxims, and on this
1309: condition only can they agree with the supreme practical law. If
1310: therefore the matter of the volition, which can be nothing else than
1311: the object of a desire that is connected with the law, enters into the
1312: practical law, as the condition of its possibility, there results
1313: heteronomy of the elective will, namely, dependence on the physical
1314: law that we should follow some impulse or inclination. In that case
1315: the will does not give itself the law, but only the precept how
1316: rationally to follow pathological law; and the maxim which, in such
1317: a case, never contains the universally legislative form, not only
1318: produces no obligation, but is itself opposed to the principle of a
1319: pure practical reason and, therefore, also to the moral disposition,
1320: even though the resulting action may be conformable to the law.
1321: 
1322: 
1323: 
1324:                        REMARK.
1325: 
1326: 
1327: 
1328: Hence a practical precept, which contains a material (and
1329: therefore empirical) condition, must never be reckoned a practical
1330: law. For the law of the pure will, which is free, brings the will into
1331: a sphere quite different from the empirical; and as the necessity
1332: involved in the law is not a physical necessity, it can only consist
1333: in the formal conditions of the possibility of a law in general. All
1334: the matter of practical rules rests on subjective conditions, which
1335: give them only a conditional universality (in case I desire this or
1336: that, what I must do in order to obtain it), and they all turn on
1337: the principle of private happiness. Now, it is indeed undeniable
1338: that every volition must have an object, and therefore a matter; but
1339: it does not follow that this is the determining principle and the
1340: condition of the maxim; for, if it is so, then this cannot be
1341: exhibited in a universally legislative form, since in that case the
1342: expectation of the existence of the object would be the determining
1343: cause of the choice, and the volition must presuppose the dependence
1344: of the faculty of desire on the existence of something; but this
1345: dependence can only be sought in empirical conditions and,
1346: therefore, can never furnish a foundation for a necessary and
1347: universal rule. Thus, the happiness of others may be the object of the
1348: will of a rational being. But if it were the determining principle
1349: of the maxim, we must assume that we find not only a rational
1350: satisfaction in the welfare of others, but also a want such as the
1351: sympathetic disposition in some men occasions. But I cannot assume the
1352: existence of this want in every rational being (not at all in God).
1353: The matter, then, of the maxim may remain, but it must not be the
1354: condition of it, else the maxim could not be fit for a law. Hence, the
1355: mere form of law, which limits the matter, must also be a reason for
1356: adding this matter to the will, not for presupposing it. For
1357: example, let the matter be my own happiness. This (rule), if I
1358: attribute it to everyone (as, in fact, I may, in the case of every
1359: finite being), can become an objective practical law only if I include
1360: the happiness of others. Therefore, the law that we should promote the
1361: happiness of others does not arise from the assumption that this is an
1362: object of everyone's choice, but merely from this, that the form of
1363: universality which reason requires as the condition of giving to a
1364: maxim of self-love the objective validity of a law is the principle
1365: that determines the will. Therefore it was not the object (the
1366: happiness of others) that determined the pure will, but it was the
1367: form of law only, by which I restricted my maxim, founded on
1368: inclination, so as to give it the universality of a law, and thus to
1369: adapt it to the practical reason; and it is this restriction alone,
1370: and not the addition of an external spring, that can give rise to
1371: the notion of the obligation to extend the maxim of my self-love to
1372: the happiness of others.

1379: 
1380: 
1381: 
1382: The direct opposite of the principle of morality is, when the
1383: principle of private happiness is made the determining principle of
1384: the will, and with this is to be reckoned, as I have shown above,
1385: everything that places the determining principle which is to serve
1386: as a law, anywhere but in the legislative form of the maxim. This
1387: contradiction, however, is not merely logical, like that which would
1388: arise between rules empirically conditioned, if they were raised to
1389: the rank of necessary principles of cognition, but is practical, and
1390: would ruin morality altogether were not the voice of reason in
1391: reference to the will so clear, so irrepressible, so distinctly
1392: audible, even to the commonest men. It can only, indeed, be maintained
1393: in the perplexing speculations of the schools, which are bold enough
1394: to shut their ears against that heavenly voice, in order to support
1395: a theory that costs no trouble.
1396: 
1397: Suppose that an acquaintance whom you otherwise liked were to
1398: attempt to justify himself to you for having borne false witness,
1399: first by alleging the, in his view, sacred duty of consulting his
1400: own happiness; then by enumerating the advantages which he had
1401: gained thereby, pointing out the prudence he had shown in securing
1402: himself against detection, even by yourself, to whom he now reveals
1403: the secret, only in order that he may be able to deny it at any
1404: time; and suppose he were then to affirm, in all seriousness, that
1405: he has fulfilled a true human duty; you would either laugh in his
1406: face, or shrink back from him with disgust; and yet, if a man has
1407: regulated his principles of action solely with a view to his own
1408: advantage, you would have nothing whatever to object against this mode
1409: of proceeding. Or suppose some one recommends you a man as steward, as
1410: a man to whom you can blindly trust all your affairs; and, in order to
1411: inspire you with confidence, extols him as a prudent man who
1412: thoroughly understands his own interest, and is so indefatigably
1413: active that he lets slip no opportunity of advancing it; lastly,
1414: lest you should be afraid of finding a vulgar selfishness in him,
1415: praises the good taste with which he lives; not seeking his pleasure
1416: in money-making, or in coarse wantonness, but in the enlargement of
1417: his knowledge, in instructive intercourse with a select circle, and
1418: even in relieving the needy; while as to the means (which, of
1419: course, derive all their value from the end), he is not particular,
1420: and is ready to use other people's money for the purpose as if it were
1421: his own, provided only he knows that he can do so safely, and
1422: without discovery; you would either believe that the recommender was
1423: mocking you, or that he had lost his senses. So sharply and clearly
1424: marked are the boundaries of morality and self-love that even the
1425: commonest eye cannot fail to distinguish whether a thing belongs to
1426: the one or the other. The few remarks that follow may appear
1427: superfluous where the truth is so plain, but at least they may serve
1428: to give a little more distinctness to the judgement of common sense.
1429: 
1430:                                           {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 95}
1431: 
1432: The principle of happiness may, indeed, furnish maxims, but never
1433: such as would be competent to be laws of the will, even if universal
1434: happiness were made the object. For since the knowledge of this
1435: rests on mere empirical data, since every man's judgement on it
1436: depends very much on his particular point of view, which is itself
1437: moreover very variable, it can supply only general rules, not
1438: universal; that is, it can give rules which on the average will most
1439: frequently fit, but not rules which must hold good always and
1440: necessarily; hence, no practical laws can be founded on it. Just
1441: because in this case an object of choice is the foundation of the rule
1442: and must therefore precede it, the rule can refer to nothing but
1443: what is [felt], and therefore it refers to experience and is founded
1444: on it, and then the variety of judgement must be endless. This
1445: principle, therefore, does not prescribe the same practical rules to
1446: all rational beings, although the rules are all included under a
1447: common title, namely, that of happiness. The moral law, however, is
1448: conceived as objectively necessary, only because it holds for everyone
1449: that has reason and will.
1450: 
1451: The maxim of self-love (prudence) only advises; the law of
1452: morality commands. Now there is a great difference between that
1453: which we are advised to do and that to which we are obliged.
1454: 
1455: The commonest intelligence can easily and without hesitation see
1456: what, on the principle of autonomy of the will, requires to be done;
1457: but on supposition of heteronomy of the will, it is hard and
1458: requires knowledge of the world to see what is to be done. That is
1459: to say, what duty is, is plain of itself to everyone; but what is to
1460: bring true durable advantage, such as will extend to the whole of
1461: one's existence, is always veiled in impenetrable obscurity; and
1462: much prudence is required to adapt the practical rule founded on it to
1463: the ends of life, even tolerably, by making proper exceptions. But the
1464: moral law commands the most punctual obedience from everyone; it must,
1465: therefore, not be so difficult to judge what it requires to be done,
1466: that the commonest unpractised understanding, even without worldly
1467: prudence, should fail to apply it rightly.
1468: 
1469: It is always in everyone's power to satisfy the categorical
1470: command of morality; whereas it is seldom possible, and by no means so
1471: to everyone, to satisfy the empirically conditioned precept of
1472: happiness, even with regard to a single purpose. The reason is that in
1473: the former case there is question only of the maxim, which must be
1474: genuine and pure; but in the latter case there is question also of
1475: one's capacity and physical power to realize a desired object. A
1476: command that everyone should try to make himself happy would be
1477: foolish, for one never commands anyone to do what he of himself
1478: infallibly wishes to do. We must only command the means, or rather
1479: supply them, since he cannot do everything that he wishes. But to
1480: command morality under the name of duty is quite rational; for, in the
1481: first place, not everyone is willing to obey its precepts if they
1482: oppose his inclinations; and as to the means of obeying this law,
1483: these need not in this case be taught, for in this respect whatever he
1484: wishes to do he can do.
1485: 
1486: He who has lost at play may be vexed at himself and his folly, but
1487: if he is conscious of having cheated at play (although he has gained
1488: thereby), he must despise himself as soon as he compares himself
1489: with the moral law. This must, therefore, be something different
1490: from the principle of private happiness. For a man must have a
1491: different criterion when he is compelled to say to himself: "I am a
1492: worthless fellow, though I have filled my purse"; and when he approves
1493: himself, and says: "I am a prudent man, for I have enriched my
1494: treasure."

1496:                                          {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 100}
1497: 
1498: Finally, there is something further in the idea of our practical
1499: reason, which accompanies the transgression of a moral law- namely,
1500: its ill desert. Now the notion of punishment, as such, cannot be
1501: united with that of becoming a partaker of happiness; for although
1502: he who inflicts the punishment may at the same time have the
1503: benevolent purpose of directing this punishment to this end, yet it
1504: must first be justified in itself as punishment, i.e., as mere harm,
1505: so that if it stopped there, and the person punished could get no
1506: glimpse of kindness hidden behind this harshness, he must yet admit
1507: that justice was done him, and that his reward was perfectly
1508: suitable to his conduct. In every punishment, as such, there must
1509: first be justice, and this constitutes the essence of the notion.
1510: Benevolence may, indeed, be united with it, but the man who has
1511: deserved punishment has not the least reason to reckon upon this.
1512: Punishment, then, is a physical evil, which, though it be not
1513: connected with moral evil as a natural consequence, ought to be
1514: connected with it as a consequence by the principles of a moral
1515: legislation. Now, if every crime, even without regarding the
1516: physical consequence with respect to the actor, is in itself
1517: punishable, that is, forfeits happiness (at least partially), it is
1518: obviously absurd to say that the crime consisted just in this, that he
1519: has drawn punishment on himself, thereby injuring his private
1520: happiness (which, on the principle of self-love, must be the proper
1521: notion of all crime). According to this view, the punishment would
1522: be the reason for calling anything a crime, and justice would, on
1523: the contrary, consist in omitting all punishment, and even
1524: preventing that which naturally follows; for, if this were done, there
1525: would no longer be any evil in the action, since the harm which
1526: otherwise followed it, and on account of which alone the action was
1527: called evil, would now be prevented. To look, however, on all
1528: rewards and punishments as merely the machinery in the hand of a
1529: higher power, which is to serve only to set rational creatures
1530: striving after their final end (happiness), this is to reduce the will
1531: to a mechanism destructive of freedom; this is so evident that it need
1532: not detain us.
1533: 
1534: More refined, though equally false, is the theory of those who
1535: suppose a certain special moral sense, which sense and not reason
1536: determines the moral law, and in consequence of which the
1537: consciousness of virtue is supposed to be directly connected with
1538: contentment and pleasure; that of vice, with mental dissatisfaction
1539: and pain; thus reducing the whole to the desire of private
1540: happiness. Without repeating what has been said above, I will here
1541: only remark the fallacy they fall into. In order to imagine the
1542: vicious man as tormented with mental dissatisfaction by the
1543: consciousness of his transgressions, they must first represent him
1544: as in the main basis of his character, at least in some degree,
1545: morally good; just as he who is pleased with the consciousness of
1546: right conduct must be conceived as already virtuous. The notion of
1547: morality and duty must, therefore, have preceded any regard to this
1548: satisfaction, and cannot be derived from it. A man must first
1549: appreciate the importance of what we call duty, the authority of the
1550: moral law, and the immediate dignity which the following of it gives
1551: to the person in his own eyes, in order to feel that satisfaction in
1552: the consciousness of his conformity to it and the bitter remorse
1553: that accompanies the consciousness of its transgression. It is,
1554: therefore, impossible to feel this satisfaction or dissatisfaction
1555: prior to the knowledge of obligation, or to make it the basis of the
1556: latter. A man must be at least half honest in order even to be able to
1557: form a conception of these feelings. I do not deny that as the human
1558: will is, by virtue of liberty, capable of being immediately determined
1559: by the moral law, so frequent practice in accordance with this
1560: principle of determination can, at least, produce subjectively a
1561: feeling of satisfaction; on the contrary, it is a duty to establish
1562: and to cultivate this, which alone deserves to be called properly
1563: the moral feeling; but the notion of duty cannot be derived from it,
1564: else we should have to suppose a feeling for the law as such, and thus
1565: make that an object of sensation which can only be thought by the
1566: reason; and this, if it is not to be a flat contradiction, would
1567: destroy all notion of duty and put in its place a mere mechanical play
1568: of refined inclinations sometimes contending with the coarser.
1569: 
1570: If now we compare our formal supreme principle of pure practical
1571: reason (that of autonomy of the will) with all previous material
1572: principles of morality, we can exhibit them all in a table in which
1573: all possible cases are exhausted, except the one formal principle; and
1574: thus we can show visibly that it is vain to look for any other
1575: principle than that now proposed. In fact all possible principles of
1576: determination of the will are either merely subjective, and
1577: therefore empirical, or are also objective and rational; and both
1578: are either external or internal.

1627: Those of the upper table are all empirical and evidently incapable
1628: of furnishing the universal principle of morality; but those in the
1629: lower table are based on reason (for perfection as a quality of
1630: things, and the highest perfection conceived as substance, that is,
1631: God, can only be thought by means of rational concepts). But the
1632: former notion, namely, that of perfection, may either be taken in a
1633: theoretic signification, and then it means nothing but the
1634: completeness of each thing in its own kind (transcendental), or that
1635: of a thing merely as a thing (metaphysical); and with that we are
1636: not concerned here. But the notion of perfection in a practical
1637: sense is the fitness or sufficiency of a thing for all sorts of
1638: purposes. This perfection, as a quality of man and consequently
1639: internal, is nothing but talent and, what strengthens or completes
1640: this, skill. Supreme perfection conceived as substance, that is God,
1641: and consequently external (considered practically), is the sufficiency
1642: of this being for all ends. Ends then must first be given,
1643: relatively to which only can the notion of perfection (whether
1644: internal in ourselves or external in God) be the determining principle
1645: of the will. But an end- being an object which must precede the
1646: determination of the will by a practical rule and contain the ground
1647: of the possibility of this determination, and therefore contain also
1648: the matter of the will, taken as its determining principle- such an
1649: end is always empirical and, therefore, may serve for the Epicurean
1650: principle of the happiness theory, but not for the pure rational
1651: principle of morality and duty. Thus, talents and the improvement of
1652: them, because they contribute to the advantages of life; or the will
1653: of God, if agreement with it be taken as the object of the will,
1654: without any antecedent independent practical principle, can be motives
1655: only by reason of the happiness expected therefrom. Hence it
1656: follows, first, that all the principles here stated are material;
1657: secondly, that they include all possible material principles; and,
1658: finally, the conclusion, that since material principles are quite
1659: incapable of furnishing the supreme moral law (as has been shown), the
1660: formal practical principle of the pure reason (according to which the
1661: mere form of a universal legislation must constitute the supreme and
1662: immediate determining principle of the will) is the only one
1663: possible which is adequate to furnish categorical imperatives, that
1664: is, practical laws (which make actions a duty), and in general to
1665: serve as the principle of morality, both in criticizing conduct and
1666: also in its application to the human will to determine it.

1676: 
1677: This Analytic shows that pure reason can be practical, that is,
1678: can of itself determine the will independently of anything
1679: empirical; and this it proves by a fact in which pure reason in us
1680: proves itself actually practical, namely, the autonomy shown in the
1681: fundamental principle of morality, by which reason determines the will
1682: to action.
1683: 
1684: It shows at the same time that this fact is inseparably connected
1685: with the consciousness of freedom of the will, nay, is identical
1686: with it; and by this the will of a rational being, although as
1687: belonging to the world of sense it recognizes itself as necessarily
1688: subject to the laws of causality like other efficient causes; yet,
1689: at the same time, on another side, namely, as a being in itself, is
1690: conscious of existing in and being determined by an intelligible order
1691: of things; conscious not by virtue of a special intuition of itself,
1692: but by virtue of certain dynamical laws which determine its
1693: causality in the sensible world; for it has been elsewhere proved that
1694: if freedom is predicated of us, it transports us into an
1695: intelligible order of things.
1696: 
1697: Now, if we compare with this the analytical part of the critique
1698: of pure speculative reason, we shall see a remarkable contrast.
1699: There it was not fundamental principles, but pure, sensible
1700: intuition (space and time), that was the first datum that made a
1701: priori knowledge possible, though only of objects of the senses.
1702: Synthetical principles could not be derived from mere concepts without
1703: intuition; on the contrary, they could only exist with reference to
1704: this intuition, and therefore to objects of possible experience, since
1705: it is the concepts of the understanding, united with this intuition,
1706: which alone make that knowledge possible which we call experience.
1707: Beyond objects of experience, and therefore with regard to things as
1708: noumena, all positive knowledge was rightly disclaimed for speculative
1709: reason. This reason, however, went so far as to establish with
1710: certainty the concept of noumena; that is, the possibility, nay, the
1711: necessity, of thinking them; for example, it showed against all
1712: objections that the supposition of freedom, negatively considered, was
1713: quite consistent with those principles and limitations of pure
1714: theoretic reason. But it could not give us any definite enlargement of
1715: our knowledge with respect to such objects, but, on the contrary,
1716: cut off all view of them altogether.
1717: 
1718: On the other hand, the moral law, although it gives no view, yet
1719: gives us a fact absolutely inexplicable from any data of the
1720: sensible world, and the whole compass of our theoretical use of
1721: reason, a fact which points to a pure world of the understanding, nay,
1722: even defines it positively and enables us to know something of it,
1723: namely, a law.

1726: 
1727: This law (as far as rational beings are concerned) gives to the
1728: world of sense, which is a sensible system of nature, the form of a
1729: world of the understanding, that is, of a supersensible system of
1730: nature, without interfering with its mechanism. Now, a system of
1731: nature, in the most general sense, is the existence of things under
1732: laws. The sensible nature of rational beings in general is their
1733: existence under laws empirically conditioned, which, from the point of
1734: view of reason, is heteronomy. The supersensible nature of the same
1735: beings, on the other hand, is their existence according to laws
1736: which are independent of every empirical condition and, therefore,
1737: belong to the autonomy of pure reason. And, since the laws by which
1738: the existence of things depends on cognition are practical,
1739: supersensible nature, so far as we can form any notion of it, is
1740: nothing else than a system of nature under the autonomy of pure
1741: practical reason. Now, the law of this autonomy is the moral law,
1742: which, therefore, is the fundamental law of a supersensible nature,
1743: and of a pure world of understanding, whose counterpart must exist
1744: in the world of sense, but without interfering with its laws. We might
1745: call the former the archetypal world (natura archetypa), which we only
1746: know in the reason; and the latter the ectypal world (natura
1747: ectypa), because it contains the possible effect of the idea of the
1748: former which is the determining principle of the will. For the moral
1749: law, in fact, transfers us ideally into a system in which pure reason,
1750: if it were accompanied with adequate physical power, would produce the
1751: summum bonum, and it determines our will to give the sensible world
1752: the form of a system of rational beings.
1753: 
1754: The least attention to oneself proves that this idea really serves
1755: as the model for the determinations of our will.
1756: 
1757: When the maxim which I am disposed to follow in giving testimony
1758: is tested by the practical reason, I always consider what it would
1759: be if it were to hold as a universal law of nature. It is manifest
1760: that in this view it would oblige everyone to speak the truth. For
1761: it cannot hold as a universal law of nature that statements should
1762: be allowed to have the force of proof and yet to be purposely
1763: untrue. Similarly, the maxim which I adopt with respect to disposing
1764: freely of my life is at once determined, when I ask myself what it
1765: should be, in order that a system, of which it is the law, should
1766: maintain itself. It is obvious that in such a system no one could
1767: arbitrarily put an end to his own life, for such an arrangement
1768: would not be a permanent order of things. And so in all similar cases.
1769: Now, in nature, as it actually is an object of experience, the free
1770: will is not of itself determined to maxims which could of themselves
1771: be the foundation of a natural system of universal laws, or which
1772: could even be adapted to a system so constituted; on the contrary, its
1773: maxims are private inclinations which constitute, indeed, a natural
1774: whole in conformity with pathological (physical) laws, but could not
1775: form part of a system of nature, which would only be possible
1776: through our will acting in accordance with pure practical laws. Yet we
1777: are, through reason, conscious of a law to which all our maxims are
1778: subject, as though a natural order must be originated from our will.
1779: This law, therefore, must be the idea of a natural system not given in
1780: experience, and yet possible through freedom; a system, therefore,
1781: which is supersensible, and to which we give objective reality, at
1782: least in a practical point of view, since we look on it as an object
1783: of our will as pure rational beings.
1784: 
1785: Hence the distinction between the laws of a natural system to
1786: which the will is subject, and of a natural system which is subject to
1787: a will (as far as its relation to its free actions is concerned),
1788: rests on this, that in the former the objects must be causes of the
1789: ideas which determine the will; whereas in the latter the will is
1790: the cause of the objects; so that its causality has its determining
1791: principle solely in the pure faculty of reason, which may therefore be
1792: called a pure practical reason.
1793: 
1794: There are therefore two very distinct problems: how, on the one
1795: side, pure reason can cognise objects a priori, and how on the other
1796: side it can be an immediate determining principle of the will, that
1797: is, of the causality of the rational being with respect to the reality
1798: of objects (through the mere thought of the universal validity of
1799: its own maxims as laws).

1802: 
1803: The former, which belongs to the critique of the pure speculative
1804: reason, requires a previous explanation, how intuitions without
1805: which no object can be given, and, therefore, none known
1806: synthetically, are possible a priori; and its solution turns out to be
1807: that these are all only sensible and, therefore, do not render
1808: possible any speculative knowledge which goes further than possible
1809: experience reaches; and that therefore all the principles of that pure
1810: speculative reason avail only to make experience possible; either
1811: experience of given objects or of those that may be given ad
1812: infinitum, but never are completely given.
1813: 
1814: The latter, which belongs to the critique of practical reason,
1815: requires no explanation how the objects of the faculty of desire are
1816: possible, for that being a problem of the theoretical knowledge of
1817: nature is left to the critique of the speculative reason, but only how
1818: reason can determine the maxims of the will; whether this takes
1819: place only by means of empirical ideas as principles of determination,
1820: or whether pure reason can be practical and be the law of a possible
1821: order of nature, which is not empirically knowable. The possibility of
1822: such a supersensible system of nature, the conception of which can
1823: also be the ground of its reality through our own free will, does
1824: not require any a priori intuition (of an intelligible world) which,
1825: being in this case supersensible, would be impossible for us. For
1826: the question is only as to the determining principle of volition in
1827: its maxims, namely, whether it is empirical, or is a conception of the
1828: pure reason (having the legal character belonging to it in general),
1829: and how it can be the latter. It is left to the theoretic principles
1830: of reason to decide whether the causality of the will suffices for the
1831: realization of the objects or not, this being an inquiry into the
1832: possibility of the objects of the volition. Intuition of these objects
1833: is therefore of no importance to the practical problem. We are here
1834: concerned only with the determination of the will and the
1835: determining principles of its maxims as a free will, not at all with
1836: the result. For, provided only that the will conforms to the law of
1837: pure reason, then let its power in execution be what it may, whether
1838: according to these maxims of legislation of a possible system of
1839: nature any such system really results or not, this is no concern of
1840: the critique, which only inquires whether, and in what way, pure
1841: reason can be practical, that is directly determine the will.
1842: 
1843: In this inquiry criticism may and must begin with pure practical
1844: laws and their reality. But instead of intuition it takes as their
1845: foundation the conception of their existence in the intelligible
1846: world, namely, the concept of freedom. For this concept has no other
1847: meaning, and these laws are only possible in relation to freedom of
1848: the will; but freedom being supposed, they are necessary; or
1849: conversely freedom is necessary because those laws are necessary,
1850: being practical postulates. It cannot be further explained how this
1851: consciousness of the moral law, or, what is the same thing, of
1852: freedom, is possible; but that it is admissible is well established in
1853: the theoretical critique.
1854: 
1855: The exposition of the supreme principle of practical reason is now
1856: finished; that is to say, it has been shown first, what it
1857: contains, that it subsists for itself quite a priori and independent
1858: of empirical principles; and next in what it is distinguished from all
1859: other practical principles. With the deduction, that is, the
1860: justification of its objective and universal validity, and the
1861: discernment of the possibility of such a synthetical proposition a
1862: priori, we cannot expect to succeed so well as in the case of the
1863: principles of pure theoretical reason. For these referred to objects
1864: of possible experience, namely, to phenomena, and we could prove
1865: that these phenomena could be known as objects of experience only by
1866: being brought under the categories in accordance with these laws;
1867: and consequently that all possible experience must conform to these
1868: laws. But I could not proceed in this way with the deduction of the
1869: moral law. For this does not concern the knowledge of the properties
1870: of objects, which may be given to the reason from some other source;
1871: but a knowledge which can itself be the ground of the existence of the
1872: objects, and by which reason in a rational being has causality,
1873: i.e., pure reason, which can be regarded as a faculty immediately
1874: determining the will.
1875: 
1876: Now all our human insight is at an end as soon as we have arrived at
1877: fundamental powers or faculties, for the possibility of these cannot
1878: be understood by any means, and just as little should it be
1879: arbitrarily invented and assumed. Therefore, in the theoretic use of
1880: reason, it is experience alone that can justify us in assuming them.
1881: But this expedient of adducing empirical proofs, instead of a
1882: deduction from a priori sources of knowledge, is denied us here in
1883: respect to the pure practical faculty of reason. For whatever requires
1884: to draw the proof of its reality from experience must depend for the
1885: grounds of its possibility on principles of experience; and pure,
1886: yet practical, reason by its very notion cannot be regarded as such.
1887: Further, the moral law is given as a fact of pure reason of which we
1888: are a priori conscious, and which is apodeictically certain, though it
1889: be granted that in experience no example of its exact fulfilment can
1890: be found. Hence, the objective reality of the moral law cannot be
1891: proved by any deduction by any efforts of theoretical reason,
1892: whether speculative or empirically supported, and therefore, even if
1893: we renounced its apodeictic certainty, it could not be proved a
1894: posteriori by experience, and yet it is firmly established of itself.
1895: 
1896:                                          {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 140}
1897: 
1898: But instead of this vainly sought deduction of the moral
1899: principle, something else is found which was quite unexpected, namely,
1900: that this moral principle serves conversely as the principle of the
1901: deduction of an inscrutable faculty which no experience could prove,
1902: but of which speculative reason was compelled at least to assume the
1903: possibility (in order to find amongst its cosmological ideas the
1904: unconditioned in the chain of causality, so as not to contradict
1905: itself)- I mean the faculty of freedom. The moral law, which itself
1906: does not require a justification, proves not merely the possibility of
1907: freedom, but that it really belongs to beings who recognize this law
1908: as binding on themselves. The moral law is in fact a law of the
1909: causality of free agents and, therefore, of the possibility of a
1910: supersensible system of nature, just as the metaphysical law of events
1911: in the world of sense was a law of causality of the sensible system of
1912: nature; and it therefore determines what speculative philosophy was
1913: compelled to leave undetermined, namely, the law for a causality,
1914: the concept of which in the latter was only negative; and therefore
1915: for the first time gives this concept objective reality.
1916: 
1917: This sort of credential of the moral law, viz., that it is set forth
1918: as a principle of the deduction of freedom, which is a causality of
1919: pure reason, is a sufficient substitute for all a priori
1920: justification, since theoretic reason was compelled to assume at least
1921: the possibility of freedom, in order to satisfy a want of its own. For
1922: the moral law proves its reality, so as even to satisfy the critique
1923: of the speculative reason, by the fact that it adds a positive
1924: definition to a causality previously conceived only negatively, the
1925: possibility of which was incomprehensible to speculative reason, which
1926: yet was compelled to suppose it. For it adds the notion of a reason
1927: that directly determines the will (by imposing on its maxims the
1928: condition of a universal legislative form); and thus it is able for
1929: the first time to give objective, though only practical, reality to
1930: reason, which always became transcendent when it sought to proceed
1931: speculatively with its ideas. It thus changes the transcendent use
1932: of reason into an immanent use (so that reason is itself, by means
1933: of ideas, an efficient cause in the field of experience).
1934: 
1935: The determination of the causality of beings in the world of
1936: sense, as such, can never be unconditioned; and yet for every series
1937: of conditions there must be something unconditioned, and therefore
1938: there must be a causality which is determined wholly by itself. Hence,
1939: the idea of freedom as a faculty of absolute spontaneity was not found
1940: to be a want but, as far as its possibility is concerned, an
1941: analytic principle of pure speculative reason. But as it is absolutely
1942: impossible to find in experience any example in accordance with this
1943: idea, because amongst the causes of things as phenomena it would be
1944: impossible to meet with any absolutely unconditioned determination
1945: of causality, we were only able to defend our supposition that a
1946: freely acting cause might be a being in the world of sense, in so
1947: far as it is considered in the other point of view as a noumenon,
1948: showing that there is no contradiction in regarding all its actions as
1949: subject to physical conditions so far as they are phenomena, and yet
1950: regarding its causality as physically unconditioned, in so far as
1951: the acting being belongs to the world of understanding, and in thus
1952: making the concept of freedom the regulative principle of reason. By
1953: this principle I do not indeed learn what the object is to which
1954: that sort of causality is attributed; but I remove the difficulty,
1955: for, on the one side, in the explanation of events in the world, and
1956: consequently also of the actions of rational beings, I leave to the
1957: mechanism of physical necessity the right of ascending from
1958: conditioned to condition ad infinitum, while on the other side I
1959: keep open for speculative reason the place which for it is vacant,
1960: namely, the intelligible, in order to transfer the unconditioned
1961: thither. But I was not able to verify this supposition; that is, to
1962: change it into the knowledge of a being so acting, not even into the
1963: knowledge of the possibility of such a being. This vacant place is now
1964: filled by pure practical reason with a definite law of causality in an
1965: intelligible world (causality with freedom), namely, the moral law.
1966: Speculative reason does not hereby gain anything as regards its
1967: insight, but only as regards the certainty of its problematical notion
1968: of freedom, which here obtains objective reality, which, though only
1969: practical, is nevertheless undoubted. Even the notion of causality-
1970: the application, and consequently the signification, of which holds
1971: properly only in relation to phenomena, so as to connect them into
1972: experiences (as is shown by the Critique of Pure Reason)- is not so
1973: enlarged as to extend its use beyond these limits. For if reason
1974: sought to do this, it would have to show how the logical relation of
1975: principle and consequence can be used synthetically in a different
1976: sort of intuition from the sensible; that is how a causa noumenon is
1977: possible. This it can never do; and, as practical reason, it does
1978: not even concern itself with it, since it only places the
1979: determining principle of causality of man as a sensible creature
1980: (which is given) in pure reason (which is therefore called practical);
1981: and therefore it employs the notion of cause, not in order to know
1982: objects, but to determine causality in relation to objects in general.
1983: It can abstract altogether from the application of this notion to
1984: objects with a view to theoretical knowledge (since this concept is
1985: always found a priori in the understanding even independently of any
1986: intuition). Reason, then, employs it only for a practical purpose, and
1987: hence we can transfer the determining principle of the will into the
1988: intelligible order of things, admitting, at the same time, that we
1989: cannot understand how the notion of cause can determine the
1990: knowledge of these things. But reason must cognise causality with
1991: respect to the actions of the will in the sensible world in a definite
1992: manner; otherwise, practical reason could not really produce any
1993: action. But as to the notion which it forms of its own causality as
1994: noumenon, it need not determine it theoretically with a view to the
1995: cognition of its supersensible existence, so as to give it
1996: significance in this way. For it acquires significance apart from
1997: this, though only for practical use, namely, through the moral law.
1998: Theoretically viewed, it remains always a pure a priori concept of the
1999: understanding, which can be applied to objects whether they have
2000: been given sensibly or not, although in the latter case it has no
2001: definite theoretical significance or application, but is only a
2002: formal, though essential, conception of the understanding relating
2003: to an object in general. The significance which reason gives it
2004: through the moral law is merely practical, inasmuch as the idea of
2005: the law of causality (of the will) has self causality, or is
2006: its determining principle.

2016: 
2017: We have in the moral principle set forth a law of causality, the
2018: determining principle of which is set above all the conditions of
2019: the sensible world; we have it conceived how the will, as belonging
2020: to the intelligible world, is determinable, and therefore have
2021: its subject (man) not merely conceived as belonging to a world of
2022: pure understanding, and in this respect unknown (which the critique of
2023: speculative reason enabled us to do), but also defined as regards
2024: his causality by means of a law which cannot be reduced to any
2025: physical law of the sensible world; and therefore our knowledge is
2026: extended beyond the limits of that world, a pretension which the
2027: Critique of Pure Reason declared to be futile in all speculation. Now,
2028: how is the practical use of pure reason here to be reconciled with the
2029: theoretical, as to the determination of the limits of its faculty?
2030: 
2031: David Hume, of whom we may say that he commenced the assault on
2032: the claims of pure reason, which made a thorough investigation of it
2033: necessary, argued thus: The notion of cause is a notion that
2034: involves the necessity of the connexion of the existence of
2035: different things (and that, in so far as they are different), so that,
2036: given A, I know that something quite distinct there from, namely B,
2037: must necessarily also exist. Now necessity can be attributed to a
2038: connection, only in so far as it is known a priori, for experience
2039: would only enable us to know of such a connection that it exists,
2040: not that it necessarily exists. Now, it is impossible, says he, to
2041: know a priori and as necessary the connection between one thing and
2042: another (or between one attribute and another quite distinct) when
2043: they have not been given in experience. Therefore the notion of a
2044: cause is fictitious and delusive and, to speak in the mildest way,
2045: is an illusion, only excusable inasmuch as the custom (a subjective
2046: necessity) of perceiving certain things, or their attributes as
2047: often associated in existence along with or in succession to one
2048: another, is insensibly taken for an objective necessity of supposing
2049: such a connection in the objects themselves; and thus the notion of
2050: a cause has been acquired surreptitiously and not legitimately; nay,
2051: it can never be so acquired or authenticated, since it demands a
2052: connection in itself vain, chimerical, and untenable in presence of
2053: reason, and to which no object can ever correspond. In this way was
2054: empiricism first introduced as the sole source of principles, as far
2055: as all knowledge of the existence of things is concerned
2056: (mathematics therefore remaining excepted); and with empiricism the
2057: most thorough scepticism, even with regard to the whole science of
2058: nature( as philosophy). For on such principles we can never conclude
2059: from given attributes of things as existing to a consequence (for this
2060: would require the notion of cause, which involves the necessity of
2061: such a connection); we can only, guided by imagination, expect similar
2062: cases- an expectation which is never certain, however often it has
2063: been fulfilled. Of no event could we say: a certain thing must have
2064: preceded it, on which it necessarily followed; that is, it must have a
2065: cause; and therefore, however frequent the cases we have known in
2066: which there was such an antecedent, so that a rule could be derived
2067: from them, yet we never could suppose it as always and necessarily
2068: so happening; we should, therefore, be obliged to leave its share to
2069: blind chance, with which all use of reason comes to an end; and this
2070: firmly establishes scepticism in reference to arguments ascending from
2071: effects to causes and makes it impregnable.
2072: 
2073: Mathematics escaped well, so far, because Hume thought that its
2074: propositions were analytical; that is, proceeded from one property
2075: to another, by virtue of identity and, consequently, according to
2076: the principle of contradiction. This, however, is not the case, since,
2077: on the contrary, they are synthetical; and although geometry, for
2078: example, has not to do with the existence of things, but only with
2079: their a priori properties in a possible intuition, yet it proceeds
2080: just as in the case of the causal notion, from one property (A) to
2081: another wholly distinct (B), as necessarily connected with the former.
2082: Nevertheless, mathematical science, so highly vaunted for its
2083: apodeictic certainty, must at last fall under this empiricism for
2084: the same reason for which Hume put custom in the place of objective
2085: necessity in the notion of cause and, in spite of all its pride,
2086: must consent to lower its bold pretension of claiming assent a
2087: priori and depend for assent to the universality of its propositions
2088: on the kindness of observers, who, when called as witnesses, would
2089: surely not hesitate to admit that what the geometer propounds as a
2090: theorem they have always perceived to be the fact, and,
2091: consequently, although it be not necessarily true, yet they would
2092: permit us to expect it to be true in the future. In this manner Hume's
2093: empiricism leads inevitably to scepticism, even with regard to
2094: mathematics, and consequently in every scientific theoretical use of
2095: reason (for this belongs either to philosophy or mathematics). Whether
2096: with such a terrible overthrow of the chief branches of knowledge,
2097: common reason will escape better, and will not rather become
2098: irrecoverably involved in this destruction of all knowledge, so that
2099: from the same principles a universal scepticism should follow
2100: (affecting, indeed, only the learned), this I will leave everyone to
2101: judge for himself.
2102: 
2103: As regards my own labours in the critical examination of pure
2104: reason, which were occasioned by Hume's sceptical teaching, but went
2105: much further and embraced the whole field of pure theoretical reason
2106: in its synthetic use and, consequently, the field of what is called
2107: metaphysics in general; I proceeded in the following manner with
2108: respect to the doubts raised by the Scottish philosopher touching
2109: the notion of causality. If Hume took the objects of experience for
2110: things in themselves (as is almost always done), he was quite right in
2111: declaring the notion of cause to be a deception and false illusion;
2112: for as to things in themselves, and their attributes as such, it is
2113: impossible to see why because A is given, B, which is different,
2114: must necessarily be also given, and therefore he could by no means
2115: admit such an a priori knowledge of things in themselves. Still less
2116: could this acute writer allow an empirical origin of this concept,
2117: since this is directly contradictory to the necessity of connection
2118: which constitutes the essence of the notion of causality, hence the
2119: notion was proscribed, and in its place was put custom in the
2120: observation of the course of perceptions.
2121: 
2122:                                          {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 150}
2123: 
2124: It resulted, however, from my inquiries, that the objects with which
2125: we have to do in experience are by no means things in themselves,
2126: but merely phenomena; and that although in the case of things in
2127: themselves it is impossible to see how, if A is supposed, it should be
2128: contradictory that B, which is quite different from A, should not also
2129: be supposed (i.e., to see the necessity of the connection between A as
2130: cause and B as effect); yet it can very well be conceived that, as
2131: phenomena, they may be necessarily connected in one experience in a
2132: certain way (e.g., with regard to time-relations); so that they
2133: could not be separated without contradicting that connection, by means
2134: of which this experience is possible in which they are objects and
2135: in which alone they are cognisable by us. And so it was found to be in
2136: fact; so that I was able not only to prove the objective reality of
2137: the concept of cause in regard to objects of experience, but also to
2138: deduce it as an a priori concept by reason of the necessity of the
2139: connection it implied; that is, to show the possibility of its
2140: origin from pure understanding without any empirical sources; and
2141: thus, after removing the source of empiricism, I was able also to
2142: overthrow the inevitable consequence of this, namely, scepticism,
2143: first with regard to physical science, and then with regard to
2144: mathematics (in which empiricism has just the same grounds), both
2145: being sciences which have reference to objects of possible experience;
2146: herewith overthrowing the thorough doubt of whatever theoretic
2147: reason professes to discern.
2148: 
2149: But how is it with the application of this category of causality
2150: (and all the others; for without them there can be no knowledge of
2151: anything existing) to things which are not objects of possible
2152: experience, but lie beyond its bounds? For I was able to deduce the
2153: objective reality of these concepts only with regard to objects of
2154: possible experience. But even this very fact, that I have saved
2155: them, only in case I have proved that objects may by means of them
2156: be thought, though not determined a priori; this it is that gives them
2157: a place in the pure understanding, by which they are referred to
2158: objects in general (sensible or not sensible). If anything is still
2159: wanting, it is that which is the condition of the application of these
2160: categories, and especially that of causality, to objects, namely,
2161: intuition; for where this is not given, the application with a view to
2162: theoretic knowledge of the object, as a noumenon, is impossible and,
2163: therefore, if anyone ventures on it, is (as in the Critique of Pure
2164: Reason) absolutely forbidden. Still, the objective reality of the
2165: concept (of causality) remains, and it can be used even of noumena,
2166: but without our being able in the least to define the concept
2167: theoretically so as to produce knowledge. For that this concept,
2168: even in reference to an object, contains nothing impossible, was shown
2169: by this, that, even while applied to objects of sense, its seat was
2170: certainly fixed in the pure understanding; and although, when referred
2171: to things in themselves (which cannot be objects of experience), it is
2172: not capable of being determined so as to represent a definite object
2173: for the purpose of theoretic knowledge; yet for any other purpose (for
2174: instance, a practical) it might be capable of being determined so as
2175: to have such application. This could not be the case if, as Hume
2176: maintained, this concept of causality contained something absolutely
2177: impossible to be thought.
2178: 
2179: In order now to discover this condition of the application of the
2180: said concept to noumena, we need only recall why we are not content
2181: with its application to objects of experience, but desire also to
2182: apply it to things in themselves. It will appear, then, that it is not
2183: a theoretic but a practical purpose that makes this a necessity. In
2184: speculation, even if we were successful in it, we should not really
2185: gain anything in the knowledge of nature, or generally with regard
2186: to such objects as are given, but we should make a wide step from
2187: the sensibly conditioned (in which we have already enough to do to
2188: maintain ourselves, and to follow carefully the chain of causes) to
2189: the supersensible, in order to complete our knowledge of principles
2190: and to fix its limits; whereas there always remains an infinite
2191: chasm unfilled between those limits and what we know; and we should
2192: have hearkened to a vain curiosity rather than a solid-desire of
2193: knowledge.
2194: 
2195: But, besides the relation in which the understanding stands to
2196: objects (in theoretical knowledge), it has also a relation to the
2197: faculty of desire, which is therefore called the will, and the pure
2198: will, inasmuch as pure understanding (in this case called reason) is
2199: practical through the mere conception of a law. The objective
2200: reality of a pure will, or, what is the same thing, of a pure
2201: practical reason, is given in the moral law a priori, as it were, by a
2202: fact, for so we may name a determination of the will which is
2203: inevitable, although it does not rest on empirical principles. Now, in
2204: the notion of a will the notion of causality is already contained, and
2205: hence the notion of a pure will contains that of a causality
2206: accompanied with freedom, that is, one which is not determinable by
2207: physical laws, and consequently is not capable of any empirical
2208: intuition in proof of its reality, but, nevertheless, completely
2209: justifies its objective reality a priori in the pure practical law;
2210: not, indeed (as is easily seen) for the purposes of the theoretical,
2211: but of the practical use of reason. Now the notion of a being that has
2212: free will is the notion of a causa noumenon, and that this notion
2213: involves no contradiction, we are already assured by the fact- that
2214: inasmuch as the concept of cause has arisen wholly from pure
2215: understanding, and has its objective reality assured by the deduction,
2216: as it is moreover in its origin independent of any sensible
2217: conditions, it is, therefore, not restricted to phenomena (unless we
2218: wanted to make a definite theoretic use of it), but can be applied
2219: equally to things that are objects of the pure understanding. But,
2220: since this application cannot rest on any intuition (for intuition can
2221: only be sensible), therefore, causa noumenon, as regards the theoretic
2222: use of reason, although a possible and thinkable, is yet an empty
2223: notion. Now, I do not desire by means of this to understand
2224: theoretically the nature of a being, in so far as it has a pure
2225: will; it is enough for me to have thereby designated it as such, and
2226: hence to combine the notion of causality with that of freedom (and
2227: what is inseparable from it, the moral law, as its determining
2228: principle). Now, this right I certainly have by virtue of the pure,
2229: not-empirical origin of the notion of cause, since I do not consider
2230: myself entitled to make any use of it except in reference to the moral
2231: law which determines its reality, that is, only a practical use.
2232: 
2233: If, with Hume, I had denied to the notion of causality all objective
2234: reality in its [theoretic] use, not merely with regard to things in
2235: themselves (the supersensible), but also with regard to the objects of
2236: the senses, it would have lost all significance, and being a
2237: theoretically impossible notion would have been declared to be quite
2238: useless; and since what is nothing cannot be made any use of, the
2239: practical use of a concept theoretically null would have been
2240: absurd. But, as it is, the concept of a causality free from
2241: empirical conditions, although empty, i.e., without any appropriate
2242: intuition), is yet theoretically possible, and refers to an
2243: indeterminate object; but in compensation significance is given to
2244: it in the moral law and consequently in a practical sense. I have,
2245: indeed, no intuition which should determine its objective theoretic
2246: reality, but not the less it has a real application, which is
2247: exhibited in concreto in intentions or maxims; that is, it has a
2248: practical reality which can be specified, and this is sufficient to
2249: justify it even with a view to noumena.
2250: 
2251:                                          {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 155}
2252: 
2253: Now, this objective reality of a pure concept of the understanding
2254: in the sphere of the supersensible, once brought in, gives an
2255: objective reality also to all the other categories, although only so
2256: far as they stand in necessary connexion with the determining
2257: principle of the will (the moral law); a reality only of practical
2258: application, which has not the least effect in enlarging our
2259: theoretical knowledge of these objects, or the discernment of their
2260: nature by pure reason. So we shall find also in the sequel that
2261: these categories refer only to beings as intelligences, and in them
2262: only to the relation of reason to the will; consequently, always
2263: only to the practical, and beyond this cannot pretend to any knowledge
2264: of these beings; and whatever other properties belonging to the
2265: theoretical representation of supersensible things may be brought into
2266: connexion with these categories, this is not to be reckoned as
2267: knowledge, but only as a right (in a practical point of view, however,
2268: it is a necessity) to admit and assume such beings, even in the case
2269: where we [conceive] supersensible beings (e.g., God) according to
2270: analogy, that is, a purely rational relation, of which we make a
2271: practical use with reference to what is sensible; and thus the
2272: application to the supersensible solely in a practical point of view
2273: does not give pure theoretic reason the least encouragement to run
2274: riot into the transcendent.

2277: 
2278: CHAPTER II. Of the Concept of an Object of Pure Practical Reason.
2279: 
2280: 
2281: 
2282: By a concept of the practical reason I understand the idea of an
2283: object as an effect possible to be produced through freedom. To be
2284: an object of practical knowledge, as such, signifies, therefore,
2285: only the relation of the will to the action by which the object or its
2286: opposite would be realized; and to decide whether something is an
2287: object of pure practical reason or not is only to discern the
2288: possibility or impossibility of willing the action by which, if we had
2289: the required power (about which experience must decide), a certain
2290: object would be realized. If the object be taken as the determining
2291: principle of our desire, it must first be known whether it is
2292: physically possible by the free use of our powers, before we decide
2293: whether it is an object of practical reason or not. On the other hand,
2294: if the law can be considered a priori as the determining principle
2295: of the action, and the latter therefore as determined by pure
2296: practical reason, the judgement whether a thing is an object of pure
2297: practical reason or not does not depend at all on the comparison
2298: with our physical power; and the question is only whether we should
2299: will an action that is directed to the existence of an object, if
2300: the object were in our power; hence the previous question is only as
2301: the moral possibility of the action, for in this case it is not the
2302: object, but the law of the will, that is the determining principle
2303: of the action. The only objects of practical reason are therefore
2304: those of good and evil. For by the former is meant an object
2305: necessarily desired according to a principle of reason; by the
2306: latter one necessarily shunned, also according to a principle of
2307: reason.
2308: 
2309: If the notion of good is not to be derived from an antecedent
2310: practical law, but, on the contrary, is to serve as its foundation, it
2311: can only be the notion of something whose existence promises pleasure,
2312: and thus determines the causality of the subject to produce it, that
2313: is to say, determines the faculty of desire. Now, since it is
2314: impossible to discern a priori what idea will be accompanied with
2315: pleasure and what with pain, it will depend on experience alone to
2316: find out what is primarily good or evil. The property of the
2317: subject, with reference to which alone this experiment can be made, is
2318: the feeling of pleasure and pain, a receptivity belonging to the
2319: internal sense; thus that only would be primarily good with which
2320: the sensation of pleasure is immediately connected, and that simply
2321: evil which immediately excites pain. Since, however, this is opposed
2322: even to the usage of language, which distinguishes the pleasant from
2323: the good, the unpleasant from the evil, and requires that good and
2324: evil shall always be judged by reason, and, therefore, by concepts
2325: which can be communicated to everyone, and not by mere sensation,
2326: which is limited to individual [subjects] and their susceptibility;
2327: and, since nevertheless, pleasure or pain cannot be connected with any
2328: idea of an object a priori, the philosopher who thought himself
2329: obliged to make a feeling of pleasure the foundation of his
2330: practical judgements would call that good which is a means to the
2331: pleasant, and evil, what is a cause of unpleasantness and pain; for
2332: the judgement on the relation of means to ends certainly belongs to
2333: reason. But, although reason is alone capable of discerning the
2334: connexion of means with their ends (so that the will might even be
2335: defined as the faculty of ends, since these are always determining
2336: principles of the desires), yet the practical maxims which would
2337: follow from the aforesaid principle of the good being merely a
2338: means, would never contain as the object of the will anything good
2339: in itself, but only something good for something; the good would
2340: always be merely the useful, and that for which it is useful must
2341: always lie outside the will, in sensation. Now if this as a pleasant
2342: sensation were to be distinguished from the notion of good, then there
2343: would be nothing primarily good at all, but the good would have to
2344: be sought only in the means to something else, namely, some
2345: pleasantness.
2346: 
2347: It is an old formula of the schools: Nihil appetimus nisi sub
2348: ratione boni; Nihil aversamur nisi sub ratione mali, and it is used
2349: often correctly, but often also in a manner injurious to philosophy,
2350: because the expressions boni and mali are ambiguous, owing to the
2351: poverty of language, in consequence of which they admit a double
2352: sense, and, therefore, inevitably bring the practical laws into
2353: ambiguity; and philosophy, which in employing them becomes aware of
2354: the different meanings in the same word, but can find no special
2355: expressions for them, is driven to subtile distinctions about which
2356: there is subsequently no unanimity, because the distinction could
2357: not be directly marked by any suitable expression. *
2358: 
2359: 
2360: 
2361: * Besides this, the expression sub ratione boni is also ambiguous.
2362: For it may mean: "We represent something to ourselves as good, when
2363: and because we desire (will) it"; or "We desire something because we
2364: represent it to ourselves as good," so that either the desire
2365: determines the notion of the object as a good, or the notion of good
2366: determines the desire (the will); so that in the first case sub
2367: ratione boni would mean, "We will something under the idea of the
2368: good"; in the second, "In consequence of this idea," which, as
2369: determining the volition, must precede it.

2372: 
2373: 
2374: 
2375: The German language has the good fortune to possess expressions
2376: which do not allow this difference to be overlooked. It possesses
2377: two very distinct concepts and especially distinct expressions for
2378: that which the Latins express by a single word, bonum. For bonum it
2379: has das Gute [good], and das Wohl [well, weal], for malum das Bose
2380: [evil], and das Ubel [ill, bad], or das Well [woe]. So that we express
2381: two quite distinct judgements when we consider in an action the good
2382: and evil of it, or our weal and woe (ill). Hence it already follows
2383: that the above quoted psychological proposition is at least very
2384: doubtful if it is translated: "We desire nothing except with a view to
2385: our weal or woe"; on the other hand, if we render it thus: "Under
2386: the direction of reason we desire nothing except so far as we esteem
2387: it good or evil," it is indubitably certain and at the same time quite
2388: clearly expressed.
2389: 
2390: Well or ill always implies only a reference to our condition, as
2391: pleasant or unpleasant, as one of pleasure or pain, and if we desire
2392: or avoid an object on this account, it is only so far as it is
2393: referred to our sensibility and to the feeling of pleasure or pain
2394: that it produces. But good or evil always implies a reference to the
2395: will, as determined by the law of reason, to make something its
2396: object; for it is never determined directly by the object and the idea
2397: of it, but is a faculty of taking a rule of reason for or motive of an
2398: action (by which an object may be realized). Good and evil therefore
2399: are properly referred to actions, not to the sensations of the person,
2400: and if anything is to be good or evil absolutely (i.e., in every
2401: respect and without any further condition), or is to be so esteemed,
2402: it can only be the manner of acting, the maxim of the will, and
2403: consequently the acting person himself as a good or evil man that
2404: can be so called, and not a thing.
2405: 
2406: However, then, men may laugh at the Stoic, who in the severest
2407: paroxysms of gout cried out: "Pain, however thou tormentest me, I will
2408: never admit that thou art an evil (kakov, malum)": he was right. A bad
2409: thing it certainly was, and his cry betrayed that; but that any evil
2410: attached to him thereby, this he had no reason whatever to admit,
2411: for pain did not in the least diminish the worth of his person, but
2412: only that of his condition. If he had been conscious of a single
2413: lie, it would have lowered his pride, but pain served only to raise
2414: it, when he was conscious that he had not deserved it by any
2415: unrighteous action by which he had rendered himself worthy of
2416: punishment.
2417: 
2418: What we call good must be an object of desire in the judgement of
2419: every rational man, and evil an object of aversion in the eyes of
2420: everyone; therefore, in addition to sense, this judgement requires
2421: reason. So it is with truthfulness, as opposed to lying; so with
2422: justice, as opposed to violence, &c. But we may call a thing a bad [or
2423: ill] thing, which yet everyone must at the same time acknowledge to be
2424: good, sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly. The man who submits to
2425: a surgical operation feels it no doubt as a bad thing, but by their
2426: reason he and everyone acknowledge it to be good. If a man who
2427: delights in annoying and vexing peaceable people at last receives a
2428: right good beating, this is no doubt a bad thing; but everyone
2429: approves it and regards it as a good thing, even though nothing else
2430: resulted from it; nay, even the man who receives it must in his reason
2431: acknowledge that he has met justice, because he sees the proportion
2432: between good conduct and good fortune, which reason inevitably
2433: places before him, here put into practice.

2436: 
2437: No doubt our weal and woe are of very great importance in the
2438: estimation of our practical reason, and as far as our nature as
2439: sensible beings is concerned, our happiness is the only thing of
2440: consequence, provided it is estimated as reason especially requires,
2441: not by the transitory sensation, but by the influence that this has on
2442: our whole existence, and on our satisfaction therewith; but it is
2443: not absolutely the only thing of consequence. Man is a being who, as
2444: belonging to the world of sense, has wants, and so far his reason
2445: has an office which it cannot refuse, namely, to attend to the
2446: interest of his sensible nature, and to form practical maxims, even
2447: with a view to the happiness of this life, and if possible even to
2448: that of a future. But he is not so completely an animal as to be
2449: indifferent to what reason says on its own account, and to use it
2450: merely as an instrument for the satisfaction of his wants as a
2451: sensible being. For the possession of reason would not raise his worth
2452: above that of the brutes, if it is to serve him only for the same
2453: purpose that instinct serves in them; it would in that case be only
2454: a particular method which nature had employed to equip man for the
2455: same ends for which it has qualified brutes, without qualifying him
2456: for any higher purpose. No doubt once this arrangement of nature has
2457: been made for him he requires reason in order to take into
2458: consideration his weal and woe, but besides this he possesses it for a
2459: higher purpose also, namely, not only to take into consideration
2460: what is good or evil in itself, about which only pure reason,
2461: uninfluenced by any sensible interest, can judge, but also to
2462: distinguish this estimate thoroughly from the former and to make it
2463: the supreme condition thereof.
2464: 
2465: In estimating what is good or evil in itself, as distinguished
2466: from what can be so called only relatively, the following points are
2467: to be considered. Either a rational principle is already conceived, as
2468: of itself the determining principle of the will, without regard to
2469: possible objects of desire (and therefore by the more legislative form
2470: of the maxim), and in that case that principle is a practical a priori
2471: law, and pure reason is supposed to be practical of itself. The law in
2472: that case determines the will directly; the action conformed to it
2473: is good in itself; a will whose maxim always conforms to this law is
2474: good absolutely in every respect and is the supreme condition of all
2475: good. Or the maxim of the will is consequent on a determining
2476: principle of desire which presupposes an object of pleasure or pain,
2477: something therefore that pleases or displeases, and the maxim of
2478: reason that we should pursue the former and avoid the latter
2479: determines our actions as good relatively to our inclination, that is,
2480: good indirectly, (i.e., relatively to a different end to which they are
2481: means), and in that case these maxims can never be called laws, but
2482: may be called rational practical precepts. The end itself, the
2483: pleasure that we seek, is in the latter case not a good but a welfare;
2484: not a concept of reason, but an empirical concept of an object of
2485: sensation; but the use of the means thereto, that is, the action, is
2486: nevertheless called good (because rational deliberation is required
2487: for it), not however, good absolutely, but only relatively to our
2488: sensuous nature, with regard to its feelings of pleasure and
2489: displeasure; but the will whose maxim is affected thereby is not a
2490: pure will; this is directed only to that in which pure reason by
2491: itself can be practical.
2492: 
2493: This is the proper place to explain the paradox of method in a
2494: critique of practical reason, namely, that the concept of good and
2495: evil must not be determined before the moral law (of which it seems as
2496: if it must be the foundation), but only after it and by means of it.
2497: In fact, even if we did not know that the principle of morality is a
2498: pure a priori law determining the will, yet, that we may not assume
2499: principles quite gratuitously, we must, at least at first, leave it
2500: undecided, whether the will has merely empirical principles of
2501: determination, or whether it has not also pure a priori principles;
2502: for it is contrary to all rules of philosophical method to assume as
2503: decided that which is the very point in question. Supposing that we
2504: wished to begin with the concept of good, in order to deduce from it
2505: the laws of the will, then this concept of an object (as a good) would
2506: at the same time assign to us this object as the sole determining
2507: principle of the will. Now, since this concept had not any practical a
2508: priori law for its standard, the criterion of good or evil could not
2509: be placed in anything but the agreement of the object with our feeling
2510: of pleasure or pain; and the use of reason could only consist in
2511: determining in the first place this pleasure or pain in connexion with
2512: all the sensations of my existence, and in the second place the
2513: means of securing to myself the object of the pleasure. Now, as
2514: experience alone can decide what conforms to the feeling of
2515: pleasure, and by hypothesis the practical law is to be based on this
2516: as a condition, it follows that the possibility of a priori
2517: practical laws would be at once excluded, because it was imagined to
2518: be necessary first of all to find an object the concept of which, as a
2519: good, should constitute the universal though empirical principle of
2520: determination of the will. But what it was necessary to inquire
2521: first of all was whether there is not an a priori determining
2522: principle of the will (and this could never be found anywhere but in a
2523: pure practical law, in so far as this law prescribes to maxims
2524: merely their form without regard to an object). Since, however, we
2525: laid the foundation of all practical law in an object determined by
2526: our conceptions of good and evil, whereas without a previous law
2527: that object could not be conceived by empirical concepts, we have
2528: deprived ourselves beforehand of the possibility of even conceiving
2529: a pure practical law. On the other hand, if we had first
2530: investigated the latter analytically, we should have found that it
2531: is not the concept of good as an object that determines the moral
2532: law and makes it possible, but that, on the contrary, it is the
2533: moral law that first determines the concept of good and makes it
2534: possible, so far as it deserves the name of good absolutely.
2535: 
2536: This remark, which only concerns the method of ultimate ethical
2537: inquiries, is of importance. It explains at once the occasion of all
2538: the mistakes of philosophers with respect to the supreme principle
2539: of morals. For they sought for an object of the will which they
2540: could make the matter and principle of a law (which consequently could
2541: not determine the will directly, but by means of that object
2542: referred to the feeling of pleasure or pain; whereas they ought
2543: first to have searched for a law that would determine the will a
2544: priori and directly, and afterwards determine the object in accordance
2545: with the will). Now, whether they placed this object of pleasure,
2546: which was to supply the supreme conception of goodness, in
2547: happiness, in perfection, in moral [feeling], or in the will of God,
2548: their principle in every case implied heteronomy, and they must
2549: inevitably come upon empirical conditions of a moral law, since
2550: their object, which was to be the immediate principle of the will,
2551: could not be called good or bad except in its immediate relation to
2552: feeling, which is always empirical. It is only a formal law- that
2553: is, one which prescribes to reason nothing more than the form of its
2554: universal legislation as the supreme condition of its maxims- that can
2555: be a priori a determining principle of practical reason. The
2556: ancients avowed this error without concealment by directing all
2557: their moral inquiries to the determination of the notion of the summum
2558: bonum, which they intended afterwards to make the determining
2559: principle of the will in the moral law; whereas it is only far
2560: later, when the moral law has been first established for itself, and
2561: shown to be the direct determining principle of the will, that this
2562: object can be presented to the will, whose form is now determined a
2563: priori; and this we shall undertake in the Dialectic of the pure
2564: practical reason. The moderns, with whom the question of the summum
2565: bonum has gone out of fashion, or at least seems to have become a
2566: secondary matter, hide the same error under vague (expressions as in
2567: many other cases). It shows itself, nevertheless, in their systems, as
2568: it always produces heteronomy of practical reason; and from this can
2569: never be derived a moral law giving universal commands.
2570: 
2571: Now, since the notions of good and evil, as consequences of the a
2572: priori determination of the will, imply also a pure practical
2573: principle, and therefore a causality of pure reason; hence they do not
2574: originally refer to objects (so as to be, for instance, special
2575: modes of the synthetic unity of the manifold of given intuitions in
2576: one consciousness) like the pure concepts of the understanding or
2577: categories of reason in its theoretic employment; on the contrary,
2578: they presuppose that objects are given; but they are all modes
2579: (modi) of a single category, namely, that of causality, the
2580: determining principle of which consists in the rational conception
2581: of a law, which as a law of freedom reason gives to itself, thereby
2582: a priori proving itself practical. However, as the actions on the
2583: one side come under a law which is not a physical law, but a law of
2584: freedom, and consequently belong to the conduct of beings in the world
2585: of intelligence, yet on the other side as events in the world of sense
2586: they belong to phenomena; hence the determinations of a practical
2587: reason are only possible in reference to the latter and, therefore, in
2588: accordance with the categories of the understanding; not indeed with a
2589: view to any theoretic employment of it, i.e., so as to bring the
2590: manifold of (sensible) intuition under one consciousness a priori; but
2591: only to subject the manifold of desires to the unity of
2592: consciousness of a practical reason, giving it commands in the moral
2593: law, i.e., to a pure will a priori.

2596: 
2597: These categories of freedom- for so we choose to call them in
2598: contrast to those theoretic categories which are categories of
2599: physical nature- have an obvious advantage over the latter, inasmuch
2600: as the latter are only forms of thought which designate objects in
2601: an indefinite manner by means of universal concept of every possible
2602: intuition; the former, on the contrary, refer to the determination
2603: of a free elective will (to which indeed no exactly corresponding
2604: intuition can be assigned, but which has as its foundation a pure
2605: practical a priori law, which is not the case with any concepts
2606: belonging to the theoretic use of our cognitive faculties); hence,
2607: instead of the form of intuition (space and time), which does not
2608: lie in reason itself, but has to be drawn from another source, namely,
2609: the sensibility, these being elementary practical concepts have as
2610: their foundation the form of a pure will, which is given in reason
2611: and, therefore, in the thinking faculty itself. From this it happens
2612: that as all precepts of pure practical reason have to do only with the
2613: determination of the will, not with the physical conditions (of
2614: practical ability) of the execution of one's purpose, the practical
2615: a priori principles in relation to the supreme principle of freedom
2616: are at once cognitions, and have not to wait for intuitions in order
2617: to acquire significance, and that for this remarkable reason,
2618: because they themselves produce the reality of that to which they
2619: refer (the intention of the will), which is not the case with
2620: theoretical concepts. Only we must be careful to observe that these
2621: categories only apply to the practical reason; and thus they proceed
2622: in order from those which are as yet subject to sensible conditions
2623: and morally indeterminate to those which are free from sensible
2624: conditions and determined merely by the moral law.

2687: It will at once be observed that in this table freedom is considered
2688: as a sort of causality not subject to empirical principles of
2689: determination, in regard to actions possible by it, which are
2690: phenomena in the world of sense, and that consequently it is
2691: referred to the categories which concern its physical possibility,
2692: whilst yet each category is taken so universally that the
2693: determining principle of that causality can be placed outside the
2694: world of sense in freedom as a property of a being in the world of
2695: intelligence; and finally the categories of modality introduce the
2696: transition from practical principles generally to those of morality,
2697: but only problematically. These can be established dogmatically only
2698: by the moral law.
2699: 
2700: I add nothing further here in explanation of the present table,
2701: since it is intelligible enough of itself. A division of this kind
2702: based on principles is very useful in any science, both for the sake
2703: of thoroughness and intelligibility. Thus, for instance, we know
2704: from the preceding table and its first number what we must begin
2705: from in practical inquiries; namely, from the maxims which every one
2706: founds on his own inclinations; the precepts which hold for a
2707: species of rational beings so far as they agree in certain
2708: inclinations; and finally the law which holds for all without regard
2709: to their inclinations, etc. In this way we survey the whole plan of
2710: what has to be done, every question of practical philosophy that has
2711: to be answered, and also the order that is to be followed.

2720: 
2721: It is the notions of good and evil that first determine an object of
2722: the will. They themselves, however, are subject to a practical rule of
2723: reason which, if it is pure reason, determines the will a priori
2724: relatively to its object. Now, whether an action which is possible
2725: to us in the world of sense, comes under the rule or not, is a
2726: question to be decided by the practical judgement, by which what is
2727: said in the rule universally (in abstracto) is applied to an action in
2728: concreto. But since a practical rule of pure reason in the first place
2729: as practical concerns the existence of an object, and in the second
2730: place as a practical rule of pure reason implies necessity as
2731: regards the existence of the action and, therefore, is a practical
2732: law, not a physical law depending on empirical principles of
2733: determination, but a law of freedom by which the will is to be
2734: determined independently on anything empirical (merely by the
2735: conception of a law and its form), whereas all instances that can
2736: occur of possible actions can only be empirical, that is, belong to
2737: the experience of physical nature; hence, it seems absurd to expect to
2738: find in the world of sense a case which, while as such it depends only
2739: on the law of nature, yet admits of the application to it of a law
2740: of freedom, and to which we can apply the supersensible idea of the
2741: morally good which is to be exhibited in it in concreto. Thus, the
2742: judgement of the pure practical reason is subject to the same
2743: difficulties as that of the pure theoretical reason. The latter,
2744: however, had means at hand of escaping from these difficulties,
2745: because, in regard to the theoretical employment, intuitions were
2746: required to which pure concepts of the understanding could be applied,
2747: and such intuitions (though only of objects of the senses) can be
2748: given a priori and, therefore, as far as regards the union of the
2749: manifold in them, conforming to the pure a priori concepts of the
2750: understanding as schemata. On the other hand, the morally good is
2751: something whose object is supersensible; for which, therefore, nothing
2752: corresponding can be found in any sensible intuition. Judgement
2753: depending on laws of pure practical reason seems, therefore, to be
2754: subject to special difficulties arising from this, that a law of
2755: freedom is to be applied to actions, which are events taking place
2756: in the world of sense, and which, so far, belong to physical nature.
2757: 
2758: But here again is opened a favourable prospect for the pure
2759: practical judgement. When I subsume under a pure practical law an
2760: action possible to me in the world of sense, I am not concerned with
2761: the possibility of the action as an event in the world of sense.
2762: This is a matter that belongs to the decision of reason in its
2763: theoretic use according to the law of causality, which is a pure
2764: concept of the understanding, for which reason has a schema in the
2765: sensible intuition. Physical causality, or the condition under which
2766: it takes place, belongs to the physical concepts, the schema of
2767: which is sketched by transcendental imagination. Here, however, we
2768: have to do, not with the schema of a case that occurs according to
2769: laws, but with the schema of a law itself (if the word is allowable
2770: here), since the fact that the will (not the action relatively to
2771: its effect) is determined by the law alone without any other
2772: principle, connects the notion of causality with quite different
2773: conditions from those which constitute physical connection.
2774: 
2775: The physical law being a law to which the objects of sensible
2776: intuition, as such, are subject, must have a schema corresponding to
2777: it- that is, a general procedure of the imagination (by which it
2778: exhibits a priori to the senses the pure concept of the
2779: understanding which the law determines). But the law of freedom
2780: (that is, of a causality not subject to sensible conditions), and
2781: consequently the concept of the unconditionally good, cannot have
2782: any intuition, nor consequently any schema supplied to it for the
2783: purpose of its application in concreto. Consequently the moral law has
2784: no faculty but the understanding to aid its application to physical
2785: objects (not the imagination); and the understanding for the
2786: purposes of the judgement can provide for an idea of the reason, not a
2787: schema of the sensibility, but a law, though only as to its form as
2788: law; such a law, however, as can be exhibited in concreto in objects
2789: of the senses, and therefore a law of nature. We can therefore call
2790: this law the type of the moral law.
2791: 
2792: The rule of the judgement according to laws of pure practical reason
2793: is this: ask yourself whether, if the action you propose were to
2794: take place by a law of the system of nature of which you were yourself
2795: a part, you could regard it as possible by your own will. Everyone
2796: does, in fact, decide by this rule whether actions are morally good or
2797: evil. Thus, people say: "If everyone permitted himself to deceive,
2798: when he thought it to his advantage; or thought himself justified in
2799: shortening his life as soon as he was thoroughly weary of it; or
2800: looked with perfect indifference on the necessity of others; and if
2801: you belonged to such an order of things, would you do so with the
2802: assent of your own will?" Now everyone knows well that if he
2803: secretly allows himself to deceive, it does not follow that everyone
2804: else does so; or if, unobserved, he is destitute of compassion, others
2805: would not necessarily be so to him; hence, this comparison of the
2806: maxim of his actions with a universal law of nature is not the
2807: determining principle of his will. Such a law is, nevertheless, a type
2808: of the estimation of the maxim on moral principles. If the maxim of
2809: the action is not such as to stand the test of the form of a universal
2810: law of nature, then it is morally impossible. This is the judgement
2811: even of common sense; for its ordinary judgements, even those of
2812: experience, are always based on the law of nature. It has it therefore
2813: always at hand, only that in cases where causality from freedom is
2814: to be criticised, it makes that law of nature only the type of a law
2815: of freedom, because, without something which it could use as an
2816: example in a case of experience, it could not give the law of a pure
2817: practical reason its proper use in practice.
2818: 
2819: It is therefore allowable to use the system of the world of sense as
2820: the type of a supersensible system of things, provided I do not
2821: transfer to the latter the intuitions, and what depends on them, but
2822: merely apply to it the form of law in general (the notion of which
2823: occurs even in the commonest use of reason, but cannot be definitely
2824: known a priori for any other purpose than the pure practical use of
2825: reason); for laws, as such, are so far identical, no matter from
2826: what they derive their determining principles.

2828:                                           {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 50}
2829: 
2830: Further, since of all the supersensible absolutely nothing [is
2831: known] except freedom (through the moral law), and this only so far as
2832: it is inseparably implied in that law, and moreover all
2833: supersensible objects to which reason might lead us, following the
2834: guidance of that law, have still no reality for us, except for the
2835: purpose of that law, and for the use of mere practical reason; and
2836: as reason is authorized and even compelled to use physical nature
2837: (in its pure form as an object of the understanding) as the type of
2838: the judgement; hence, the present remark will serve to guard against
2839: reckoning amongst concepts themselves that which belongs only to the
2840: typic of concepts. This, namely, as a typic of the judgement, guards
2841: against the empiricism of practical reason, which founds the practical
2842: notions of good and evil merely on experienced consequences (so-called
2843: happiness). No doubt happiness and the infinite advantages which would
2844: result from a will determined by self-love, if this will at the same
2845: time erected itself into a universal law of nature, may certainly
2846: serve as a perfectly suitable type of the morally good, but it is
2847: not identical with it. The same typic guards also against the
2848: mysticism of practical reason, which turns what served only as a
2849: symbol into a schema, that is, proposes to provide for the moral
2850: concepts actual intuitions, which, however, are not sensible
2851: (intuitions of an invisible Kingdom of God), and thus plunges into the
2852: transcendent. What is befitting the use of the moral concepts is
2853: only the rationalism of the judgement, which takes from the sensible
2854: system of nature only what pure reason can also conceive of itself,
2855: that is, conformity to law, and transfers into the supersensible
2856: nothing but what can conversely be actually exhibited by actions in
2857: the world of sense according to the formal rule of a law of nature.
2858: However, the caution against empiricism of practical reason is much
2859: more important; for mysticism is quite reconcilable with the purity
2860: and sublimity of the moral law, and, besides, it is not very natural
2861: or agreeable to common habits of thought to strain one's imagination
2862: to supersensible intuitions; and hence the danger on this side is
2863: not so general. Empiricism, on the contrary, cuts up at the roots
2864: the morality of intentions (in which, and not in actions only,
2865: consists the high worth that men can and ought to give to themselves),
2866: and substitutes for duty something quite different, namely, an
2867: empirical interest, with which the inclinations generally are secretly
2868: leagued; and empiricism, moreover, being on this account allied with
2869: all the inclinations which (no matter what fashion they put on)
2870: degrade humanity when they are raised to the dignity of a supreme
2871: practical principle; and as these, nevertheless, are so favourable
2872: to everyone's feelings, it is for that reason much more dangerous than
2873: mysticism, which can never constitute a lasting condition of any great
2874: number of persons.

2878:   CHAPTER III. Of the Motives of Pure Practical Reason.
2879: 
2880: 
2881: 
2882: What is essential in the moral worth of actions is that the moral
2883: law should directly determine the will. If the determination of the
2884: will takes place in conformity indeed to the moral law, but only by
2885: means of a feeling, no matter of what kind, which has to be
2886: presupposed in order that the law may be sufficient to determine the
2887: will, and therefore not for the sake of the law, then the action
2888: will possess legality, but not morality. Now, if we understand by
2889: motive (elater animi) the subjective ground of determination of the
2890: will of a being whose reason does not necessarily conform to the
2891: objective law, by virtue of its own nature, then it will follow,
2892: first, that no motives can be attributed to the Divine will, and that
2893: the motives of the human will (as well as that of every created
2894: rational being) can never be anything else than the moral law, and
2895: consequently that the objective principle of determination must always
2896: and alone be also the subjectively sufficient determining principle of
2897: the action, if this is not merely to fulfil the letter of the law,
2898: without containing its spirit. *
2899: 
2900: 
2901: 
2902: * We may say of every action that conforms to the law, but is not
2903: done for the sake of the law, that it is morally good in the letter,
2904: not in the spirit (the intention).
2905: 
2906: 
2907: 
2908: Since, then, for the purpose of giving the moral law influence
2909: over the will, we must not seek for any other motives that might
2910: enable us to dispense with the motive of the law itself, because
2911: that would produce mere hypocrisy, without consistency; and it is even
2912: dangerous to allow other motives (for instance, that of interest) even
2913: to co-operate along with the moral law; hence nothing is left us but
2914: to determine carefully in what way the moral law becomes a motive, and
2915: what effect this has upon the faculty of desire. For as to the
2916: question how a law can be directly and of itself a determining
2917: principle of the will (which is the essence of morality), this is, for
2918: human reason, an insoluble problem and identical with the question:
2919: how a free will is possible. Therefore what we have to show a priori
2920: is not why the moral law in itself supplies a motive, but what
2921: effect it, as such, produces (or, more correctly speaking, must
2922: produce) on the mind.
2923: 
2924:                                            {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 5}
2925: 
2926: The essential point in every determination of the will by the
2927: moral law is that being a free will it is determined simply by the
2928: moral law, not only without the co-operation of sensible impulses, but
2929: even to the rejection of all such, and to the checking of all
2930: inclinations so far as they might be opposed to that law. So far,
2931: then, the effect of the moral law as a motive is only negative, and
2932: this motive can be known a priori to be such. For all inclination
2933: and every sensible impulse is founded on feeling, and the negative
2934: effect produced on feeling (by the check on the inclinations) is
2935: itself feeling; consequently, we can see a priori that the moral
2936: law, as a determining principle of the will, must by thwarting all our
2937: inclinations produce a feeling which may be called pain; and in this
2938: we have the first, perhaps the only, instance in which we are able
2939: from a priori considerations to determine the relation of a
2940: cognition (in this case of pure practical reason) to the feeling of
2941: pleasure or displeasure. All the inclinations together (which can be
2942: reduced to a tolerable system, in which case their satisfaction is
2943: called happiness) constitute self-regard (solipsismus). This is either
2944: the self-love that consists in an excessive fondness for oneself
2945: (philautia), or satisfaction with oneself (arrogantia). The former
2946: is called particularly selfishness; the latter self-conceit. Pure
2947: practical reason only checks selfishness, looking on it as natural and
2948: active in us even prior to the moral law, so far as to limit it to the
2949: condition of agreement with this law, and then it is called rational
2950: self-love. But self-conceit reason strikes down altogether, since
2951: all claims to self-esteem which precede agreement with the moral law
2952: are vain and unjustifiable, for the certainty of a state of mind
2953: that coincides with this law is the first condition of personal
2954: worth (as we shall presently show more clearly), and prior to this
2955: conformity any pretension to worth is false and unlawful. Now the
2956: propensity to self-esteem is one of the inclinations which the moral
2957: law checks, inasmuch as that esteem rests only on morality.
2958: Therefore the moral law breaks down self-conceit. But as this law is
2959: something positive in itself, namely, the form of an intellectual
2960: causality, that is, of freedom, it must be an object of respect;
2961: for, by opposing the subjective antagonism of the inclinations, it
2962: weakens self-conceit; and since it even breaks down, that is,
2963: humiliates, this conceit, it is an object of the highest respect
2964: and, consequently, is the foundation of a positive feeling which is
2965: not of empirical origin, but is known a priori. Therefore respect
2966: for the moral law is a feeling which is produced by an intellectual
2967: cause, and this feeling is the only one that we know quite a priori
2968: and the necessity of which we can perceive.
2969: 
2970: In the preceding chapter we have seen that everything that
2971: presents itself as an object of the will prior to the moral law is
2972: by that law itself, which is the supreme condition of practical
2973: reason, excluded from the determining principles of the will which
2974: we have called the unconditionally good; and that the mere practical
2975: form which consists in the adaptation of the maxims to universal
2976: legislation first determines what is good in itself and absolutely,
2977: and is the basis of the maxims of a pure will, which alone is good
2978: in every respect. However, we find that our nature as sensible
2979: beings is such that the matter of desire (objects of inclination,
2980: whether of hope or fear) first presents itself to us; and our
2981: pathologically affected self, although it is in its maxims quite unfit
2982: for universal legislation; yet, just as if it constituted our entire
2983: self, strives to put its pretensions forward first, and to have them
2984: acknowledged as the first and original. This propensity to make
2985: ourselves in the subjective determining principles of our choice serve
2986: as the objective determining principle of the will generally may be
2987: called self-love; and if this pretends to be legislative as an
2988: unconditional practical principle it may be called self-conceit. Now
2989: the moral law, which alone is truly objective (namely, in every
2990: respect), entirely excludes the influence of self-love on the
2991: supreme practical principle, and indefinitely checks the
2992: self-conceit that prescribes the subjective conditions of the former
2993: as laws. Now whatever checks our self-conceit in our own judgement
2994: humiliates; therefore the moral law inevitably humbles every man
2995: when he compares with it the physical propensities of his nature.
2996: That, the idea of which as a determining principle of our will humbles
2997: us in our self-consciousness, awakes respect for itself, so far as
2998: it is itself positive and a determining principle. Therefore the moral
2999: law is even subjectively a cause of respect. Now since everything that
3000: enters into self-love belongs to inclination, and all inclination
3001: rests on feelings, and consequently whatever checks all the feelings
3002: together in self-love has necessarily, by this very circumstance, an
3003: influence on feeling; hence we comprehend how it is possible to
3004: perceive a priori that the moral law can produce an effect on feeling,
3005: in that it excludes the inclinations and the propensity to make them
3006: the supreme practical condition, i.e., self-love, from all
3007: participation in the supreme legislation. This effect is on one side
3008: merely negative, but on the other side, relatively to the
3009: restricting principle of pure practical reason, it is positive. No
3010: special kind of feeling need be assumed for this under the name of a
3011: practical or moral feeling as antecedent to the moral law and
3012: serving as its foundation.
3013: 
3014: The negative effect on feeling (unpleasantness) is pathological,
3015: like every influence on feeling and like every feeling generally.
3016: But as an effect of the consciousness of the moral law, and
3017: consequently in relation to a supersensible cause, namely, the subject
3018: of pure practical reason which is the supreme lawgiver, this feeling
3019: of a rational being affected by inclinations is called humiliation
3020: (intellectual self-depreciation); but with reference to the positive
3021: source of this humiliation, the law, it is respect for it. There is
3022: indeed no feeling for this law; but inasmuch as it removes the
3023: resistance out of the way, this removal of an obstacle is, in the
3024: judgement of reason, esteemed equivalent to a positive help to its
3025: causality. Therefore this feeling may also be called a feeling of
3026: respect for the moral law, and for both reasons together a moral
3027: feeling.
3028: 
3029: While the moral law, therefore, is a formal determining principle of
3030: action by practical pure reason, and is moreover a material though
3031: only objective determining principle of the objects of action as
3032: called good and evil, it is also a subjective determining principle,
3033: that is, a motive to this action, inasmuch as it has influence on
3034: the morality of the subject and produces a feeling conducive to the
3035: influence of the law on the will. There is here in the subject no
3036: antecedent feeling tending to morality. For this is impossible,
3037: since every feeling is sensible, and the motive of moral intention
3038: must be free from all sensible conditions. On the contrary, while
3039: the sensible feeling which is at the bottom of all our inclinations is
3040: the condition of that impression which we call respect, the cause that
3041: determines it lies in the pure practical reason; and this impression
3042: therefore, on account of its origin, must be called, not a
3043: pathological but a practical effect. For by the fact that the
3044: conception of the moral law deprives self-love of its influence, and
3045: self-conceit of its illusion, it lessens the obstacle to pure
3046: practical reason and produces the conception of the superiority of its
3047: objective law to the impulses of the sensibility; and thus, by
3048: removing the counterpoise, it gives relatively greater weight to the
3049: law in the judgement of reason (in the case of a will affected by
3050: the aforesaid impulses). Thus the respect for the law is not a
3051: motive to morality, but is morality itself subjectively considered
3052: as a motive, inasmuch as pure practical reason, by rejecting all the
3053: rival pretensions of self-love, gives authority to the law, which now
3054: alone has influence. Now it is to be observed that as respect is an
3055: effect on feeling, and therefore on the sensibility, of a rational
3056: being, it presupposes this sensibility, and therefore also the
3057: finiteness of such beings on whom the moral law imposes respect; and
3058: that respect for the law cannot be attributed to a supreme being, or
3059: to any being free from all sensibility, in whom, therefore, this
3060: sensibility cannot be an obstacle to practical reason.
3061: 
3062: This feeling (which we call the moral feeling) is therefore produced
3063: simply by reason. It does not serve for the estimation of actions
3064: nor for the foundation of the objective moral law itself, but merely
3065: as a motive to make this of itself a maxim. But what name could we
3066: more suitably apply to this singular feeling which cannot be
3067: compared to any pathological feeling? It is of such a peculiar kind
3068: that it seems to be at the disposal of reason only, and that pure
3069: practical reason.
3070: 
3071:                                           {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 10}
3072: 
3073: Respect applies always to persons only- not to things. The latter
3074: may arouse inclination, and if they are animals (e.g., horses, dogs,
3075: etc.), even love or fear, like the sea, a volcano, a beast of prey;
3076: but never respect. Something that comes nearer to this feeling is
3077: admiration, and this, as an affection, astonishment, can apply to
3078: things also, e.g., lofty mountains, the magnitude, number, and
3079: distance of the heavenly bodies, the strength and swiftness of many
3080: animals, etc. But all this is not respect. A man also may be an object
3081: to me of love, fear, or admiration, even to astonishment, and yet
3082: not be an object of respect. His jocose humour, his courage and
3083: strength, his power from the rank he has amongst others, may inspire
3084: me with sentiments of this kind, but still inner respect for him is
3085: wanting. Fontenelle says, "I bow before a great man, but my mind
3086: does not bow." I would add, before an humble plain man, in whom I
3087: perceive uprightness of character in a higher degree than I am
3088: conscious of in myself,- my mind bows whether I choose it or not,
3089: and though I bear my head never so high that he may not forget my
3090: superior rank. Why is this? Because his example exhibits to me a law
3091: that humbles my self-conceit when I compare it with my conduct: a law,
3092: the practicability of obedience to which I see proved by fact before
3093: my eyes. Now, I may even be conscious of a like degree of uprightness,
3094: and yet the respect remains. For since in man all good is defective,
3095: the law made visible by an example still humbles my pride, my standard
3096: being furnished by a man whose imperfections, whatever they may be,
3097: are not known to me as my own are, and who therefore appears to me
3098: in a more favourable light. Respect is a tribute which we cannot
3099: refuse to merit, whether we will or not; we may indeed outwardly
3100: withhold it, but we cannot help feeling it inwardly.
3101: 
3102: Respect is so far from being a feeling of pleasure that we only
3103: reluctantly give way to it as regards a man. We try to find
3104: out something that may lighten the burden of it, some fault
3105: to compensate us for the humiliation which such an example
3106: causes. Even the dead are not always secure from this criticism,
3107: especially if their example appears inimitable. Even the moral law
3108: itself in its solemn majesty is exposed to this endeavour to save
3109: oneself from yielding it respect. Can it be thought that it is for any
3110: other reason that we are so ready to reduce it to the level of our
3111: familiar inclination, or that it is for any other reason that we all
3112: take such trouble to make it out to be the chosen precept of our own
3113: interest well understood, but that we want to be free from the
3114: deterrent respect which shows us our own unworthiness with such
3115: severity? Nevertheless, on the other hand, so little is there pain
3116: in it that if once one has laid aside self-conceit and allowed
3117: practical influence to that respect, he can never be satisfied with
3118: contemplating the majesty of this law, and the soul believes itself
3119: elevated in proportion as it sees the holy law elevated above it and
3120: its frail nature. No doubt great talents and activity proportioned
3121: to them may also occasion respect or an analogous feeling. It is
3122: very proper to yield it to them, and then it appears as if this
3123: sentiment were the same thing as admiration. But if we look closer
3124: we shall observe that it is always uncertain how much of the ability
3125: is due to native talent, and how much to diligence in cultivating
3126: it. Reason represents it to us as probably the fruit of cultivation,
3127: and therefore as meritorious, and this notably reduces our
3128: self-conceit, and either casts a reproach on us or urges us to
3129: follow such an example in the way that is suitable to us. This
3130: respect, then, which we show to such a person (properly speaking, to
3131: the law that his example exhibits) is not mere admiration; and this is
3132: confirmed also by the fact that when the common run of admirers
3133: think they have learned from any source the badness of such a man's
3134: character (for instance Voltaire's) they give up all respect for
3135: him; whereas the true scholar still feels it at least with regard to
3136: his talents, because he is himself engaged in a business and a
3137: vocation which make imitation of such a man in some degree a law.
3138: 
3139: Respect for the moral law is, therefore, the only and the
3140: undoubted moral motive, and this feeling is directed to no object,
3141: except on the ground of this law. The moral law first determines the
3142: will objectively and directly in the judgement of reason; and freedom,
3143: whose causality can be determined only by the law, consists just in
3144: this, that it restricts all inclinations, and consequently
3145: self-esteem, by the condition of obedience to its pure law. This
3146: restriction now has an effect on feeling, and produces the
3147: impression of displeasure which can be known a priori from the moral
3148: law. Since it is so far only a negative effect which, arising from the
3149: influence of pure practical reason, checks the activity of the
3150: subject, so far as it is determined by inclinations, and hence
3151: checks the opinion of his personal worth (which, in the absence of
3152: agreement with the moral law, is reduced to nothing); hence, the
3153: effect of this law on feeling is merely humiliation. We can,
3154: therefore, perceive this a priori, but cannot know by it the force
3155: of the pure practical law as a motive, but only the resistance to
3156: motives of the sensibility. But since the same law is objectively,
3157: that is, in the conception of pure reason, an immediate principle of
3158: determination of the will, and consequently this humiliation takes
3159: place only relatively to the purity of the law; hence, the lowering of
3160: the pretensions of moral self-esteem, that is, humiliation on the
3161: sensible side, is an elevation of the moral, i.e., practical, esteem
3162: for the law itself on the intellectual side; in a word, it is
3163: respect for the law, and therefore, as its cause is intellectual, a
3164: positive feeling which can be known a priori. For whatever
3165: diminishes the obstacles to an activity furthers this activity itself.
3166: Now the recognition of the moral law is the consciousness of an
3167: activity of practical reason from objective principles, which only
3168: fails to reveal its effect in actions because subjective
3169: (pathological) causes hinder it. Respect for the moral law then must
3170: be regarded as a positive, though indirect, effect of it on feeling,
3171: inasmuch as this respect weakens the impeding influence of
3172: inclinations by humiliating self-esteem; and hence also as a subjective
3173: principle of activity, that is, as a motive to obedience to the law,
3174: and as a principle of the maxims of a life conformable to it. From the
3175: notion of a motive arises that of an interest, which can never be
3176: attributed to any being unless it possesses reason, and which
3177: signifies a motive of the will in so far as it is conceived by the
3178: reason. Since in a morally good will the law itself must be the
3179: motive, the moral interest is a pure interest of practical reason
3180: alone, independent of sense. On the notion of an interest is based
3181: that of a maxim. This, therefore, is morally good only in case it
3182: rests simply on the interest taken in obedience to the law. All
3183: three notions, however, that of a motive, of an interest, and of a
3184: maxim, can be applied only to finite beings. For they all suppose a
3185: limitation of the nature of the being, in that the subjective
3186: character of his choice does not of itself agree with the objective
3187: law of a practical reason; they suppose that the being requires to
3188: be impelled to action by something, because an internal obstacle
3189: opposes itself. Therefore they cannot be applied to the Divine will.
3190: 
3191: There is something so singular in the unbounded esteem for the
3192: pure moral law, apart from all advantage, as it is presented for our
3193: obedience by practical reason, the voice of which makes even the
3194: boldest sinner tremble and compels him to hide himself from it, that
3195: we cannot wonder if we find this influence of a mere intellectual idea
3196: on the feelings quite incomprehensible to speculative reason and
3197: have to be satisfied with seeing so much of this a priori that such
3198: a feeling is inseparably connected with the conception of the moral
3199: law in every finite rational being. If this feeling of respect were
3200: pathological, and therefore were a feeling of pleasure based on the
3201: inner sense, it would be in vain to try to discover a connection of it
3202: with any idea a priori. But [it] is a feeling that applies merely to
3203: what is practical, and depends on the conception of a law, simply as
3204: to its form, not on account of any object, and therefore cannot be
3205: reckoned either as pleasure or pain, and yet produces an interest in
3206: obedience to the law, which we call the moral interest, just as the
3207: capacity of taking such an interest in the law (or respect for the
3208: moral law itself) is properly the moral feeling.
3209: 
3210: The consciousness of a free submission of the will to the law, yet
3211: combined with an inevitable constraint put upon all inclinations,
3212: though only by our own reason, is respect for the law. The law that
3213: demands this respect and inspires it is clearly no other than the
3214: moral (for no other precludes all inclinations from exercising any
3215: direct influence on the will). An action which is objectively
3216: practical according to this law, to the exclusion of every determining
3217: principle of inclination, is duty, and this by reason of that
3218: exclusion includes in its concept practical obligation, that is, a
3219: determination to actions, however reluctantly they may be done. The
3220: feeling that arises from the consciousness of this obligation is not
3221: pathological, as would be a feeling produced by an object of the
3222: senses, but practical only, that is, it is made possible by a
3223: preceding (objective) determination of the will and a causality of the
3224: reason. As submission to the law, therefore, that is, as a command
3225: (announcing constraint for the sensibly affected subject), it contains
3226: in it no pleasure, but on the contrary, so far, pain in the action. On
3227: the other hand, however, as this constraint is exercised merely by the
3228: legislation of our own reason, it also contains something elevating,
3229: and this subjective effect on feeling, inasmuch as pure practical
3230: reason is the sole cause of it, may be called in this respect
3231: self-approbation, since we recognize ourselves as determined thereto
3232: solely by the law without any interest, and are now conscious of a
3233: quite different interest subjectively produced thereby, and which is
3234: purely practical and free; and our taking this interest in an action
3235: of duty is not suggested by any inclination, but is commanded and
3236: actually brought about by reason through the practical law; whence
3237: this feeling obtains a special name, that of respect.
3238: 
3239:                                           {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 15}
3240: 
3241: The notion of duty, therefore, requires in the action,
3242: objectively, agreement with the law, and, subjectively in its maxim,
3243: that respect for the law shall be the sole mode in which the will is
3244: determined thereby. And on this rests the distinction between the
3245: consciousness of having acted according to duty and from duty, that
3246: is, from respect for the law. The former (legality) is possible even
3247: if inclinations have been the determining principles of the will;
3248: but the latter (morality), moral worth, can be placed only in this,
3249: that the action is done from duty, that is, simply for the sake of the
3250: law. *
3251: 
3252: 
3253: 
3254: * If we examine accurately the notion of respect for persons as it
3255: has been already laid down, we shall perceive that it always rests
3256: on the consciousness of a duty which an example shows us, and that
3257: respect, therefore, can never have any but a moral ground, and that it
3258: is very good and even, in a psychological point of view, very useful
3259: for the knowledge of mankind, that whenever we use this expression
3260: we should attend to this secret and marvellous, yet often recurring,
3261: regard which men in their judgement pay to the moral law.
3262: 
3263: 
3264: 
3265: It is of the greatest importance to attend with the utmost exactness
3266: in all moral judgements to the subjective principle of all maxims,
3267: that all the morality of actions may be placed in the necessity of
3268: acting from duty and from respect for the law, not from love and
3269: inclination for that which the actions are to produce. For men and all
3270: created rational beings moral necessity is constraint, that is
3271: obligation, and every action based on it is to be conceived as a duty,
3272: not as a proceeding previously pleasing, or likely to be pleasing to
3273: us of our own accord. As if indeed we could ever bring it about that
3274: without respect for the law, which implies fear, or at least
3275: apprehension of transgression, we of ourselves, like the independent
3276: Deity, could ever come into possession of holiness of will by the
3277: coincidence of our will with the pure moral law becoming as it were
3278: part of our nature, never to be shaken (in which case the law would
3279: cease to be a command for us, as we could never be tempted to be
3280: untrue to it).
3281: 
3282:                                           {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 20}
3283: 
3284: The moral law is in fact for the will of a perfect being a law of
3285: holiness, but for the will of every finite rational being a law of
3286: duty, of moral constraint, and of the determination of its actions
3287: by respect for this law and reverence for its duty. No other
3288: subjective principle must be assumed as a motive, else while the
3289: action might chance to be such as the law prescribes, yet, as does not
3290: proceed from duty, the intention, which is the thing properly in
3291: question in this legislation, is not moral.
3292: 
3293: It is a very beautiful thing to do good to men from love to them and
3294: from sympathetic good will, or to be just from love of order; but this
3295: is not yet the true moral maxim of our conduct which is suitable to
3296: our position amongst rational beings as men, when we pretend with
3297: fanciful pride to set ourselves above the thought of duty, like
3298: volunteers, and, as if we were independent on the command, to want
3299: to do of our own good pleasure what we think we need no command to do.
3300: We stand under a discipline of reason and in all our maxims must not
3301: forget our subjection to it, nor withdraw anything therefrom, or by an
3302: egotistic presumption diminish aught of the authority of the law
3303: (although our own reason gives it) so as to set the determining
3304: principle of our will, even though the law be conformed to, anywhere
3305: else but in the law itself and in respect for this law. Duty and
3306: obligation are the only names that we must give to our relation to the
3307: moral law. We are indeed legislative members of a moral kingdom
3308: rendered possible by freedom, and presented to us by reason as an
3309: object of respect; but yet we are subjects in it, not the sovereign,
3310: and to mistake our inferior position as creatures, and
3311: presumptuously to reject the authority of the moral law, is already to
3312: revolt from it in spirit, even though the letter of it is fulfilled.
3313: 
3314: With this agrees very well the possibility of such a command as:
3315: Love God above everything, and thy neighbour as thyself. * For as a
3316: command it requires respect for a law which commands love and does not
3317: leave it to our own arbitrary choice to make this our principle.
3318: Love to God, however, considered as an inclination (pathological
3319: love), is impossible, for He is not an object of the senses. The
3320: same affection towards men is possible no doubt, but cannot be
3321: commanded, for it is not in the power of any man to love anyone at
3322: command; therefore it is only practical love that is meant in that
3323: pith of all laws. To love God means, in this sense, to like to do
3324: His commandments; to love one's neighbour means to like to practise
3325: all duties towards him. But the command that makes this a rule
3326: cannot command us to have this disposition in actions conformed to
3327: duty, but only to endeavour after it. For a command to like to do a
3328: thing is in itself contradictory, because if we already know of
3329: ourselves what we are bound to do, and if further we are conscious
3330: of liking to do it, a command would be quite needless; and if we do it
3331: not willingly, but only out of respect for the law, a command that
3332: makes this respect the motive of our maxim would directly counteract
3333: the disposition commanded. That law of all laws, therefore, like all
3334: the moral precepts of the Gospel, exhibits the moral disposition in
3335: all its perfection, in which, viewed as an ideal of holiness, it is
3336: not attainable by any creature, but yet is the pattern which we should
3337: strive to approach, and in an uninterrupted but infinite progress
3338: become like to. In fact, if a rational creature could ever reach
3339: this point, that he thoroughly likes to do all moral laws, this
3340: would mean that there does not exist in him even the possibility of
3341: a desire that would tempt him to deviate from them; for to overcome
3342: such a desire always costs the subject some sacrifice and therefore
3343: requires self-compulsion, that is, inward constraint to something that
3344: one does not quite like to do; and no creature can ever reach this
3345: stage of moral disposition. For, being a creature, and therefore
3346: always dependent with respect to what he requires for complete
3347: satisfaction, he can never be quite free from desires and
3348: inclinations, and as these rest on physical causes, they can never
3349: of themselves coincide with the moral law, the sources of which are
3350: quite different; and therefore they make it necessary to found the
3351: mental disposition of one's maxims on moral obligation, not on ready
3352: inclination, but on respect, which demands obedience to the law,
3353: even though one may not like it; not on love, which apprehends no
3354: inward reluctance of the will towards the law. Nevertheless, this
3355: latter, namely, love to the law (which would then cease to be a
3356: command, and then morality, which would have passed subjectively
3357: into holiness, would cease to be virtue) must be the constant though
3358: unattainable goal of his endeavours. For in the case of what we highly
3359: esteem, but yet (on account of the consciousness of our weakness)
3360: dread, the increased facility of satisfying it changes the most
3361: reverential awe into inclination, and respect into love; at least this
3362: would be the perfection of a disposition devoted to the law, if it
3363: were possible for a creature to attain it.
3364: 
3365: 
3366: 
3367: * This law is in striking contrast with the principle of private
3368: happiness which some make the supreme principle of morality. This
3369: would be expressed thus: Love thyself above everything, and God and
3370: thy neighbour for thine own sake.

3373: 
3374: 
3375: 
3376: This reflection is intended not so much to clear up the
3377: evangelical command just cited, in order to prevent religious
3378: fanaticism in regard to love of God, but to define accurately the
3379: moral disposition with regard directly to our duties towards men,
3380: and to check, or if possible prevent, a merely moral fanaticism
3381: which infects many persons. The stage of morality on which man (and,
3382: as far as we can see, every rational creature) stands is respect for
3383: the moral law. The disposition that he ought to have in obeying this
3384: is to obey it from duty, not from spontaneous inclination, or from
3385: an endeavour taken up from liking and unbidden; and this proper
3386: moral condition in which he can always be is virtue, that is, moral
3387: disposition militant, and not holiness in the fancied possession of
3388: a perfect purity of the disposition of the will. It is nothing but
3389: moral fanaticism and exaggerated self-conceit that is infused into the
3390: mind by exhortation to actions as noble, sublime, and magnanimous,
3391: by which men are led into the delusion that it is not duty, that is,
3392: respect for the law, whose yoke (an easy yoke indeed, because reason
3393: itself imposes it on us) they must bear, whether they like it or
3394: not, that constitutes the determining principle of their actions,
3395: and which always humbles them while they obey it; fancying that
3396: those actions are expected from them, not from duty, but as pure
3397: merit. For not only would they, in imitating such deeds from such a
3398: principle, not have fulfilled the spirit of the law in the least,
3399: which consists not in the legality of the action (without regard to
3400: principle), but in the subjection of the mind to the law; not only
3401: do they make the motives pathological (seated in sympathy or
3402: self-love), not moral (in the law), but they produce in this way a
3403: vain, high-flying, fantastic way of thinking, flattering themselves
3404: with a spontaneous goodness of heart that needs neither spur nor
3405: bridle, for which no command is needed, and thereby forgetting their
3406: obligation, which they ought to think of rather than merit. Indeed
3407: actions of others which are done with great sacrifice, and merely
3408: for the sake of duty, may be praised as noble and sublime, but only so
3409: far as there are traces which suggest that they were done wholly out
3410: of respect for duty and not from excited feelings. If these,
3411: however, are set before anyone as examples to be imitated, respect for
3412: duty (which is the only true moral feeling) must be employed as the
3413: motive- this severe holy precept which never allows our vain self-love
3414: to dally with pathological impulses (however analogous they may be
3415: to morality), and to take a pride in meritorious worth. Now if we
3416: search we shall find for all actions that are worthy of praise a law
3417: of duty which commands, and does not leave us to choose what may be
3418: agreeable to our inclinations. This is the only way of representing
3419: things that can give a moral training to the soul, because it alone is
3420: capable of solid and accurately defined principles.
3421: 
3422: If fanaticism in its most general sense is a deliberate over
3423: stepping of the limits of human reason, then moral fanaticism is
3424: such an over stepping of the bounds that practical pure reason sets to
3425: mankind, in that it forbids us to place the subjective determining
3426: principle of correct actions, that is, their moral motive, in anything
3427: but the law itself, or to place the disposition which is thereby
3428: brought into the maxims in anything but respect for this law, and
3429: hence commands us to take as the supreme vital principle of all
3430: morality in men the thought of duty, which strikes down all
3431: arrogance as well as vain self-love.
3432: 
3433: If this is so, it is not only writers of romance or sentimental
3434: educators (although they may be zealous opponents of
3435: sentimentalism), but sometimes even philosophers, nay, even the
3436: severest of all, the Stoics, that have brought in moral fanaticism
3437: instead of a sober but wise moral discipline, although the
3438: fanaticism of the latter was more heroic, that of the former of an
3439: insipid, effeminate character; and we may, without hypocrisy, say of
3440: the moral teaching of the Gospel, that it first, by the purity of
3441: its moral principle, and at the same time by its suitability to the
3442: limitations of finite beings, brought all the good conduct of men
3443: under the discipline of a duty plainly set before their eyes, which
3444: does not permit them to indulge in dreams of imaginary moral
3445: perfections; and that it also set the bounds of humility (that is,
3446: self-knowledge) to self-conceit as well as to self-love, both which
3447: are ready to mistake their limits.
3448: 
3449: Duty! Thou sublime and mighty name that dost embrace nothing
3450: charming or insinuating, but requirest submission, and yet seekest not
3451: to move the will by threatening aught that would arouse natural
3452: aversion or terror, but merely holdest forth a law which of itself
3453: finds entrance into the mind, and yet gains reluctant reverence
3454: (though not always obedience), a law before which all inclinations are
3455: dumb, even though they secretly counter-work it; what origin is
3456: there worthy of thee, and where is to be found the root of thy noble
3457: descent which proudly rejects all kindred with the inclinations; a
3458: root to be derived from which is the indispensable condition of the
3459: only worth which men can give themselves?

3462: 
3463: It can be nothing less than a power which elevates man above himself
3464: (as a part of the world of sense), a power which connects him with
3465: an order of things that only the understanding can conceive, with a
3466: world which at the same time commands the whole sensible world, and
3467: with it the empirically determinable existence of man in time, as well
3468: as the sum total of all ends (which totality alone suits such
3469: unconditional practical laws as the moral). This power is nothing
3470: but personality, that is, freedom and independence on the mechanism of
3471: nature, yet, regarded also as a faculty of a being which is subject to
3472: special laws, namely, pure practical laws given by its own reason;
3473: so that the person as belonging to the sensible world is subject to
3474: his own personality as belonging to the intelligible [supersensible]
3475: world. It is then not to be wondered at that man, as belonging to both
3476: worlds, must regard his own nature in reference to its second and
3477: highest characteristic only with reverence, and its laws with the
3478: highest respect.
3479: 
3480: On this origin are founded many expressions which designate the
3481: worth of objects according to moral ideas. The moral law is holy
3482: (inviolable). Man is indeed unholy enough, but he must regard humanity
3483: in his own person as holy. In all creation every thing one chooses and
3484: over which one has any power, may be used merely as means; man
3485: alone, and with him every rational creature, is an end in himself.
3486: By virtue of the autonomy of his freedom he is the subject of the
3487: moral law, which is holy. Just for this reason every will, even
3488: every person's own individual will, in relation to itself, is
3489: restricted to the condition of agreement with the autonomy of the
3490: rational being, that is to say, that it is not to be subject to any
3491: purpose which cannot accord with a law which might arise from the will
3492: of the passive subject himself; the latter is, therefore, never to
3493: be employed merely as means, but as itself also, concurrently, an end.
3494: We justly attribute this condition even to the Divine will, with
3495: regard to the rational beings in the world, which are His creatures,
3496: since it rests on their personality, by which alone they are ends in
3497: themselves.
3498: 
3499: This respect-inspiring idea of personality which sets before our
3500: eyes the sublimity of our nature (in its higher aspect), while at
3501: the same time it shows us the want of accord of our conduct with it
3502: and thereby strikes down self-conceit, is even natural to the
3503: commonest reason and easily observed. Has not every even moderately
3504: honourable man sometimes found that, where by an otherwise inoffensive
3505: lie he might either have withdrawn himself from an unpleasant
3506: business, or even have procured some advantages for a loved and
3507: well-deserving friend, he has avoided it solely lest he should despise
3508: himself secretly in his own eyes? When an upright man is in the
3509: greatest distress, which he might have avoided if he could only have
3510: disregarded duty, is he not sustained by the consciousness that he has
3511: maintained humanity in its proper dignity in his own person and
3512: honoured it, that he has no reason to be ashamed of himself in his own
3513: sight, or to dread the inward glance of self-examination? This
3514: consolation is not happiness, it is not even the smallest part of
3515: it, for no one would wish to have occasion for it, or would,
3516: perhaps, even desire a life in such circumstances. But he lives, and
3517: he cannot endure that he should be in his own eyes unworthy of life.
3518: This inward peace is therefore merely negative as regards what can
3519: make life pleasant; it is, in fact, only the escaping the danger of
3520: sinking in personal worth, after everything else that is valuable
3521: has been lost. It is the effect of a respect for something quite
3522: different from life, something in comparison and contrast with which
3523: life with all its enjoyment has no value. He still lives only
3524: because it is his duty, not because he finds anything pleasant in
3525: life.
3526: 
3527: Such is the nature of the true motive of pure practical reason; it
3528: is no other than the pure moral law itself, inasmuch as it makes us
3529: conscious of the sublimity of our own supersensible existence and
3530: subjectively produces respect for their higher nature in men who are
3531: also conscious of their sensible existence and of the consequent
3532: dependence of their pathologically very susceptible nature. Now with
3533: this motive may be combined so many charms and satisfactions of life
3534: that even on this account alone the most prudent choice of a
3535: rational Epicurean reflecting on the greatest advantage of life
3536: would declare itself on the side of moral conduct, and it may even
3537: be advisable to join this prospect of a cheerful enjoyment of life
3538: with that supreme motive which is already sufficient of itself; but
3539: only as a counterpoise to the attractions which vice does not fail
3540: to exhibit on the opposite side, and not so as, even in the smallest
3541: degree, to place in this the proper moving power when duty is in
3542: question. For that would be just the same as to wish to taint the
3543: purity of the moral disposition in its source. The majesty of duty has
3544: nothing to do with enjoyment of life; it has its special law and its
3545: special tribunal, and though the two should be never so well shaken
3546: together to be given well mixed, like medicine, to the sick soul,
3547: yet they will soon separate of themselves; and if they do not, the
3548: former will not act; and although physical life might gain somewhat in
3549: force, the moral life would fade away irrecoverably.

3555: Critical Examination of the Analytic of Pure Practical Reason.
3556: 
3557: 
3558: 
3559: By the critical examination of a science, or of a portion of it,
3560: which constitutes a system by itself, I understand the inquiry and
3561: proof why it must have this and no other systematic form, when we
3562: compare it with another system which is based on a similar faculty
3563: of knowledge. Now practical and speculative reason are based on the
3564: same faculty, so far as both are pure reason. Therefore the difference
3565: in their systematic form must be determined by the comparison of both,
3566: and the ground of this must be assigned.
3567: 
3568: The Analytic of pure theoretic reason had to do with the knowledge
3569: of such objects as may have been given to the understanding, and was
3570: obliged therefore to begin from intuition and consequently (as this is
3571: always sensible) from sensibility; and only after that could advance
3572: to concepts (of the objects of this intuition), and could only end
3573: with principles after both these had preceded. On the contrary,
3574: since practical reason has not to do with objects so as to know
3575: them, but with its own faculty of realizing them (in accordance with
3576: the knowledge of them), that is, with a will which is a causality,
3577: inasmuch as reason contains its determining principle; since,
3578: consequently, it has not to furnish an object of intuition, but as
3579: practical reason has to furnish only a law (because the notion of
3580: causality always implies the reference to a law which determines the
3581: existence of the many in relation to one another); hence a critical
3582: examination of the Analytic of reason, if this is to be practical
3583: reason (and this is properly the problem), must begin with the
3584: possibility of practical principles a priori. Only after that can it
3585: proceed to concepts of the objects of a practical reason, namely,
3586: those of absolute good and evil, in order to assign them in accordance
3587: with those principles (for prior to those principles they cannot
3588: possibly be given as good and evil by any faculty of knowledge), and
3589: only then could the section be concluded with the last chapter,
3590: that, namely, which treats of the relation of the pure practical
3591: reason to the sensibility and of its necessary influence thereon,
3592: which is a priori cognisable, that is, of the moral sentiment. Thus
3593: the Analytic of the practical pure reason has the whole extent of
3594: the conditions of its use in common with the theoretical, but in
3595: reverse order. The Analytic of pure theoretic reason was divided
3596: into transcendental Aesthetic and transcendental Logic, that of the
3597: practical reversely into Logic and Aesthetic of pure practical
3598: reason (if I may, for the sake of analogy merely, use these
3599: designations, which are not quite suitable). This logic again was
3600: there divided into the Analytic of concepts and that of principles:
3601: here into that of principles and concepts. The Aesthetic also had in
3602: the former case two parts, on account of the two kinds of sensible
3603: intuition; here the sensibility is not considered as a capacity of
3604: intuition at all, but merely as feeling (which can be a subjective
3605: ground of desire), and in regard to it pure practical reason admits no
3606: further division.
3607: 
3608: It is also easy to see the reason why this division into two parts
3609: with its subdivision was not actually adopted here (as one might
3610: have been induced to attempt by the example of the former critique).
3611: For since it is pure reason that is here considered in its practical
3612: use, and consequently as proceeding from a priori principles, and
3613: not from empirical principles of determination, hence the division
3614: of the analytic of pure practical reason must resemble that of a
3615: syllogism; namely, proceeding from the universal in the major
3616: premiss (the moral principle), through a minor premiss containing a
3617: subsumption of possible actions (as good or evil) under the former, to
3618: the conclusion, namely, the subjective determination of the will (an
3619: interest in the possible practical good, and in the maxim founded on
3620: it). He who has been able to convince himself of the truth of the
3621: positions occurring in the Analytic will take pleasure in such
3622: comparisons; for they justly suggest the expectation that we may
3623: perhaps some day be able to discern the unity of the whole faculty
3624: of reason (theoretical as well as practical) and be able to derive all
3625: from one principle, which, is what human reason inevitably demands, as
3626: it finds complete satisfaction only in a perfectly systematic unity of
3627: its knowledge.

3630: 
3631: If now we consider also the contents of the knowledge that we can
3632: have of a pure practical reason, and by means of it, as shown by the
3633: Analytic, we find, along with a remarkable analogy between it and
3634: the theoretical, no less remarkable differences. As regards the
3635: theoretical, the faculty of a pure rational cognition a priori could
3636: be easily and evidently proved by examples from sciences (in which, as
3637: they put their principles to the test in so many ways by methodical
3638: use, there is not so much reason as in common knowledge to fear a
3639: secret mixture of empirical principles of cognition). But, that pure
3640: reason without the admixture of any empirical principle is practical
3641: of itself, this could only be shown from the commonest practical use
3642: of reason, by verifying the fact, that every man's natural reason
3643: acknowledges the supreme practical principle as the supreme law of his
3644: will- a law completely a priori and not depending on any sensible
3645: data. It was necessary first to establish and verify the purity of its
3646: origin, even in the judgement of this common reason, before science
3647: could take it in hand to make use of it, as a fact, that is, prior
3648: to all disputation about its possibility, and all the consequences
3649: that may be drawn from it. But this circumstance may be readily
3650: explained from what has just been said; because practical pure
3651: reason must necessarily begin with principles, which therefore must be
3652: the first data, the foundation of all science, and cannot be derived
3653: from it. It was possible to effect this verification of moral
3654: principles as principles of a pure reason quite well, and with
3655: sufficient certainty, by a single appeal to the judgement of common
3656: sense, for this reason, that anything empirical which might slip
3657: into our maxims as a determining principle of the will can be detected
3658: at once by the feeling of pleasure or pain which necessarily
3659: attaches to it as exciting desire; whereas pure practical reason
3660: positively refuses to admit this feeling into its principle as a
3661: condition. The heterogeneity of the determining principles (the
3662: empirical and rational) is clearly detected by this resistance of a
3663: practically legislating reason against every admixture of inclination,
3664: and by a peculiar kind of sentiment, which, however, does not
3665: precede the legislation of the practical reason, but, on the contrary,
3666: is produced by this as a constraint, namely, by the feeling of a
3667: respect such as no man has for inclinations of whatever kind but for
3668: the law only; and it is detected in so marked and prominent a manner
3669: that even the most uninstructed cannot fail to see at once in an
3670: example presented to him, that empirical principles of volition may
3671: indeed urge him to follow their attractions, but that he can never
3672: be expected to obey anything but the pure practical law of reason
3673: alone.
3674: 
3675: The distinction between the doctrine of happiness and the doctrine
3676: of morality, in the former of which empirical principles constitute
3677: the entire foundation, while in the second they do not form the
3678: smallest part of it, is the first and most important office of the
3679: Analytic of pure practical reason; and it must proceed in it with as
3680: much exactness and, so to speak, scrupulousness, as any geometer in
3681: his work. The philosopher, however, has greater difficulties to
3682: contend with here (as always in rational cognition by means of
3683: concepts merely without construction), because he cannot take any
3684: intuition as a foundation (for a pure noumenon). He has, however, this
3685: advantage that, like the chemist, he can at any time make an
3686: experiment with every man's practical reason for the purpose of
3687: distinguishing the moral (pure) principle of determination from the
3688: empirical; namely, by adding the moral law (as a determining
3689: principle) to the empirically affected will (e.g., that of the man who
3690: would be ready to lie because he can gain something thereby). It is as
3691: if the analyst added alkali to a solution of lime in hydrochloric
3692: acid, the acid at once forsakes the lime, combines with the alkali,
3693: and the lime is precipitated. Just in the same way, if to a man who is
3694: otherwise honest (or who for this occasion places himself only in
3695: thought in the position of an honest man), we present the moral law by
3696: which he recognises the worthlessness of the liar, his practical
3697: reason (in forming a judgement of what ought to be done) at once
3698: forsakes the advantage, combines with that which maintains in him
3699: respect for his own person (truthfulness), and the advantage after
3700: it has been separated and washed from every particle of reason
3701: (which is altogether on the side of duty) is easily weighed by
3702: everyone, so that it can enter into combination with reason in other
3703: cases, only not where it could be opposed to the moral law, which
3704: reason never forsakes, but most closely unites itself with.
3705: 
3706: But it does not follow that this distinction between the principle
3707: of happiness and that of morality is an opposition between them, and
3708: pure practical reason does not require that we should renounce all
3709: claim to happiness, but only that the moment duty is in question we
3710: should take no account of happiness. It may even in certain respects
3711: be a duty to provide for happiness; partly, because (including
3712: skill, wealth, riches) it contains means for the fulfilment of our
3713: duty; partly, because the absence of it (e.g., poverty) implies
3714: temptations to transgress our duty. But it can never be an immediate
3715: duty to promote our happiness, still less can it be the principle of
3716: all duty. Now, as all determining principles of the will, except the
3717: law of pure practical reason alone (the moral law), are all
3718: empirical and, therefore, as such, belong to the principle of
3719: happiness, they must all be kept apart from the supreme principle of
3720: morality and never be incorporated with it as a condition; since
3721: this would be to destroy all moral worth just as much as any empirical
3722: admixture with geometrical principles would destroy the certainty of
3723: mathematical evidence, which in Plato's opinion is the most
3724: excellent thing in mathematics, even surpassing their utility.
3725: 
3726: Instead, however, of the deduction of the supreme principle of
3727: pure practical reason, that is, the explanation of the possibility
3728: of such a knowledge a priori, the utmost we were able to do was to
3729: show that if we saw the possibility of the freedom of an efficient
3730: cause, we should also see not merely the possibility, but even the
3731: necessity, of the moral law as the supreme practical law of rational
3732: beings, to whom we attribute freedom of causality of their will;
3733: because both concepts are so inseparably united that we might define
3734: practical freedom as independence of the will on anything but the
3735: moral law. But we cannot perceive the possibility of the freedom of an
3736: efficient cause, especially in the world of sense; we are fortunate if
3737: only we can be sufficiently assured that there is no proof of its
3738: impossibility, and are now, by the moral law which postulates it,
3739: compelled and therefore authorized to assume it. However, there are
3740: still many who think that they can explain this freedom on empirical
3741: principles, like any other physical faculty, and treat it as a
3742: psychological property, the explanation of which only requires a
3743: more exact study of the nature of the soul and of the motives of the
3744: will, and not as a transcendental predicate of the causality of a
3745: being that belongs to the world of sense (which is really the
3746: point). They thus deprive us of the grand revelation which we obtain
3747: through practical reason by means of the moral law, the revelation,
3748: namely, of a supersensible world by the realization of the otherwise
3749: transcendent concept of freedom, and by this deprive us also of the
3750: moral law itself, which admits no empirical principle of
3751: determination. Therefore it will be necessary to add something here as
3752: a protection against this delusion and to exhibit empiricism in its
3753: naked superficiality.
3754: 
3755: The notion of causality as physical necessity, in opposition to
3756: the same notion as freedom, concerns only the existence of things so
3757: far as it is determinable in time, and, consequently, as phenomena, in
3758: opposition to their causality as things in themselves. Now if we
3759: take the attributes of existence of things in time for attributes of
3760: things in themselves (which is the common view), then it is impossible
3761: to reconcile the necessity of the causal relation with freedom; they
3762: are contradictory. For from the former it follows that every event,
3763: and consequently every action that takes place at a certain point of
3764: time, is a necessary result of what existed in time preceding. Now
3765: as time past is no longer in my power, hence every action that I
3766: perform must be the necessary result of certain determining grounds
3767: which are not in my power, that is, at the moment in which I am acting
3768: I am never free. Nay, even if I assume that my whole existence is
3769: independent on any foreign cause (for instance, God), so that the
3770: determining principles of my causality, and even of my whole
3771: existence, were not outside myself, yet this would not in the least
3772: transform that physical necessity into freedom. For at every moment of
3773: time I am still under the necessity of being determined to action by
3774: that which is not in my power, and the series of events infinite a
3775: parte priori, which I only continue according to a pre-determined
3776: order and could never begin of myself, would be a continuous
3777: physical chain, and therefore my causality would never be freedom.
3778: 
3779:                                           {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 45}
3780: 
3781: If, then, we would attribute freedom to a being whose existence is
3782: determined in time, we cannot except him from the law of necessity
3783: as to all events in his existence and, consequently, as to his actions
3784: also; for that would be to hand him over to blind chance. Now as
3785: this law inevitably applies to all the causality of things, so far
3786: as their existence is determinable in time, it follows that if this
3787: were the mode in which we had also to conceive the existence of
3788: these things in themselves, freedom must be rejected as a vain and
3789: impossible conception. Consequently, if we would still save it, no
3790: other way remains but to consider that the existence of a thing, so
3791: far as it is determinable in time, and therefore its causality,
3792: according to the law of physical necessity, belong to appearance,
3793: and to attribute freedom to the same being as a thing in itself.
3794: This is certainly inevitable, if we would retain both these
3795: contradictory concepts together; but in application, when we try to
3796: explain their combination in one and the same action, great
3797: difficulties present themselves which seem to render such a
3798: combination impracticable.
3799: 
3800: When I say of a man who commits a theft that, by the law of
3801: causality, this deed is a necessary result of the determining causes
3802: in preceding time, then it was impossible that it could not have
3803: happened; how then can the judgement, according to the moral law, make
3804: any change, and suppose that it could have been omitted, because the
3805: law says that it ought to have been omitted; that is, how can a man be
3806: called quite free at the same moment, and with respect to the same
3807: action in which he is subject to an inevitable physical necessity?
3808: Some try to evade this by saying that the causes that determine his
3809: causality are of such a kind as to agree with a comparative notion
3810: of freedom. According to this, that is sometimes called a free effect,
3811: the determining physical cause of which lies within the acting thing
3812: itself, e.g., that which a projectile performs when it is in free
3813: motion, in which case we use the word freedom, because while it is
3814: in flight it is not urged by anything external; or as we call the
3815: motion of a clock a free motion, because it moves its hands itself,
3816: which therefore do not require to be pushed by external force; so
3817: although the actions of man are necessarily determined by causes which
3818: precede in time, we yet call them free, because these causes are ideas
3819: produced by our own faculties, whereby desires are evoked on
3820: occasion of circumstances, and hence actions are wrought according
3821: to our own pleasure. This is a wretched subterfuge with which some
3822: persons still let themselves be put off, and so think they have
3823: solved, with a petty word- jugglery, that difficult problem, at the
3824: solution of which centuries have laboured in vain, and which can
3825: therefore scarcely be found so completely on the surface. In fact,
3826: in the question about the freedom which must be the foundation of
3827: all moral laws and the consequent responsibility, it does not matter
3828: whether the principles which necessarily determine causality by a
3829: physical law reside within the subject or without him, or in the
3830: former case whether these principles are instinctive or are
3831: conceived by reason, if, as is admitted by these men themselves, these
3832: determining ideas have the ground of their existence in time and in
3833: the antecedent state, and this again in an antecedent, etc. Then it
3834: matters not that these are internal; it matters not that they have a
3835: psychological and not a mechanical causality, that is, produce actions
3836: by means of ideas and not by bodily movements; they are still
3837: determining principles of the causality of a being whose existence
3838: is determinable in time, and therefore under the necessitation of
3839: conditions of past time, which therefore, when the subject has to act,
3840: are no longer in his power. This may imply psychological freedom (if
3841: we choose to apply this term to a merely internal chain of ideas in
3842: the mind), but it involves physical necessity and, therefore, leaves
3843: no room for transcendental freedom, which must be conceived as
3844: independence on everything empirical, and, consequently, on nature
3845: generally, whether it is an object of the internal sense considered in
3846: time only, or of the external in time and space. Without this
3847: freedom (in the latter and true sense), which alone is practical a
3848: priori, no moral law and no moral imputation are possible. Just for
3849: this reason the necessity of events in time, according to the physical
3850: law of causality, may be called the mechanism of nature, although we
3851: do not mean by this that things which are subject to it must be really
3852: material machines. We look here only to the necessity of the
3853: connection of events in a time-series as it is developed according
3854: to the physical law, whether the subject in which this development
3855: takes place is called automaton materiale when the mechanical being is
3856: moved by matter, or with Leibnitz spirituale when it is impelled by
3857: ideas; and if the freedom of our will were no other than the latter
3858: (say the psychological and comparative, not also transcendental,
3859: that is, absolute), then it would at bottom be nothing better than the
3860: freedom of a turnspit, which, when once it is wound up, accomplishes
3861: its motions of itself.
3862: 
3863: Now, in order to remove in the supposed case the apparent
3864: contradiction between freedom and the mechanism of nature in one and
3865: the same action, we must remember what was said in the Critique of
3866: Pure Reason, or what follows therefrom; viz., that the necessity of
3867: nature, which cannot co-exist with the freedom of the subject,
3868: appertains only to the attributes of the thing that is subject to
3869: time-conditions, consequently only to those of the acting subject as a
3870: phenomenon; that therefore in this respect the determining
3871: principles of every action of the same reside in what belongs to
3872: past time and is no longer in his power (in which must be included his
3873: own past actions and the character that these may determine for him in
3874: his own eyes as a phenomenon). But the very same subject, being on the
3875: other side conscious of himself as a thing in himself, considers his
3876: existence also in so far as it is not subject to time-conditions,
3877: and regards himself as only determinable by laws which he gives
3878: himself through reason; and in this his existence nothing is
3879: antecedent to the determination of his will, but every action, and
3880: in general every modification of his existence, varying according to
3881: his internal sense, even the whole series of his existence as a
3882: sensible being is in the consciousness of his supersensible
3883: existence nothing but the result, and never to be regarded as the
3884: determining principle, of his causality as a noumenon. In this view
3885: now the rational being can justly say of every unlawful action that he
3886: performs, that he could very well have left it undone; although as
3887: appearance it is sufficiently determined in the past, and in this
3888: respect is absolutely necessary; for it, with all the past which
3889: determines it, belongs to the one single phenomenon of his character
3890: which he makes for himself, in consequence of which he imputes the
3891: causality of those appearances to himself as a cause independent on
3892: sensibility.
3893: 
3894: With this agree perfectly the judicial sentences of that wonderful
3895: faculty in us which we call conscience. A man may use as much art as
3896: he likes in order to paint to himself an unlawful act, that he
3897: remembers, as an unintentional error, a mere oversight, such as one
3898: can never altogether avoid, and therefore as something in which he was
3899: carried away by the stream of physical necessity, and thus to make
3900: himself out innocent, yet he finds that the advocate who speaks in his
3901: favour can by no means silence the accuser within, if only he is
3902: conscious that at the time when he did this wrong he was in his
3903: senses, that is, in possession of his freedom; and, nevertheless, he
3904: accounts for his error from some bad habits, which by gradual
3905: neglect of attention he has allowed to grow upon him to such a
3906: degree that he can regard his error as its natural consequence,
3907: although this cannot protect him from the blame and reproach which
3908: he casts upon himself. This is also the ground of repentance for a
3909: long past action at every recollection of it; a painful feeling
3910: produced by the moral sentiment, and which is practically void in so
3911: far as it cannot serve to undo what has been done. (Hence Priestley,
3912: as a true and consistent fatalist, declares it absurd, and he deserves
3913: to be commended for this candour more than those who, while they
3914: maintain the mechanism of the will in fact, and its freedom in words
3915: only, yet wish it to be thought that they include it in their system
3916: of compromise, although they do not explain the possibility of such
3917: moral imputation.) But the pain is quite legitimate, because when
3918: the law of our intelligible [supersensible] existence (the moral
3919: law) is in question, reason recognizes no distinction of time, and
3920: only asks whether the event belongs to me, as my act, and then
3921: always morally connects the same feeling with it, whether it has
3922: happened just now or long ago. For in reference to the supersensible
3923: consciousness of its existence (i.e., freedom) the life of sense is
3924: but a single phenomenon, which, inasmuch as it contains merely
3925: manifestations of the mental disposition with regard to the moral
3926: law (i.e., of the character), must be judged not according to the
3927: physical necessity that belongs to it as phenomenon, but according
3928: to the absolute spontaneity of freedom. It may therefore be admitted
3929: that, if it were possible to have so profound an insight into a
3930: man's mental character as shown by internal as well as external
3931: actions as to know all its motives, even the smallest, and likewise
3932: all the external occasions that can influence them, we could calculate
3933: a man's conduct for the future with as great certainty as a lunar or
3934: solar eclipse; and nevertheless we may maintain that the man is
3935: free. In fact, if we were capable of a further glance, namely, an
3936: intellectual intuition of the same subject (which indeed is not
3937: granted to us, and instead of it we have only the rational concept),
3938: then we should perceive that this whole chain of appearances in regard
3939: to all that concerns the moral laws depends on the spontaneity of
3940: the subject as a thing in itself, of the determination of which no
3941: physical explanation can be given. In default of this intuition, the
3942: moral law assures us of this distinction between the relation of our
3943: actions as appearance to our sensible nature, and the relation of this
3944: sensible nature to the supersensible substratum in us. In this view,
3945: which is natural to our reason, though inexplicable, we can also
3946: justify some judgements which we passed with all conscientiousness,
3947: and which yet at first sight seem quite opposed to all equity. There
3948: are cases in which men, even with the same education which has been
3949: profitable to others, yet show such early depravity, and so continue
3950: to progress in it to years of manhood, that they are thought to be
3951: born villains, and their character altogether incapable of
3952: improvement; and nevertheless they are judged for what they do or
3953: leave undone, they are reproached for their faults as guilty; nay,
3954: they themselves (the children) regard these reproaches as well
3955: founded, exactly as if in spite of the hopeless natural quality of
3956: mind ascribed to them, they remained just as responsible as any
3957: other man. This could not happen if we did not suppose that whatever
3958: springs from a man's choice (as every action intentionally performed
3959: undoubtedly does) has as its foundation a free causality, which from
3960: early youth expresses its character in its manifestations (i.e.,
3961: actions). These, on account of the uniformity of conduct, exhibit a
3962: natural connection, which however does not make the vicious quality of
3963: the will necessary, but on the contrary, is the consequence of the
3964: evil principles voluntarily adopted and unchangeable, which only
3965: make it so much the more culpable and deserving of punishment. There
3966: still remains a difficulty in the combination of freedom with the
3967: mechanism of nature in a being belonging to the world of sense; a
3968: difficulty which, even after all the foregoing is admitted,
3969: threatens freedom with complete destruction. But with this danger
3970: there is also a circumstance that offers hope of an issue still
3971: favourable to freedom; namely, that the same difficulty presses much
3972: more strongly (in fact as we shall presently see, presses only) on the
3973: system that holds the existence determinable in time and space to be
3974: the existence of things in themselves; it does not therefore oblige us
3975: to give up our capital supposition of the ideality of time as a mere
3976: form of sensible intuition, and consequently as a mere manner of
3977: representation which is proper to the subject as belonging to the
3978: world of sense; and therefore it only requires that this view be
3979: reconciled with this idea.
3980: 
3981: The difficulty is as follows: Even if it is admitted that the
3982: supersensible subject can be free with respect to a given action,
3983: although, as a subject also belonging to the world of sense, he is
3984: under mechanical conditions with respect to the same action, still, as
3985: soon as we allow that God as universal first cause is also the cause
3986: of the existence of substance (a proposition which can never be
3987: given up without at the same time giving up the notion of God as the
3988: Being of all beings, and therewith giving up his all sufficiency, on
3989: which everything in theology depends), it seems as if we must admit
3990: that a man's actions have their determining principle in something
3991: which is wholly out of his power- namely, in the causality of a
3992: Supreme Being distinct from himself and on whom his own existence
3993: and the whole determination of his causality are absolutely dependent.
3994: In point of fact, if a man's actions as belonging to his modifications
3995: in time were not merely modifications of him as appearance, but as a
3996: thing in itself, freedom could not be saved. Man would be a marionette
3997: or an automaton, like Vaucanson's, prepared and wound up by the
3998: Supreme Artist. Self-consciousness would indeed make him a thinking
3999: automaton; but the consciousness of his own spontaneity would be
4000: mere delusion if this were mistaken for freedom, and it would
4001: deserve this name only in a comparative sense, since, although the
4002: proximate determining causes of its motion and a long series of
4003: their determining causes are internal, yet the last and highest is
4004: found in a foreign hand. Therefore I do not see how those who still
4005: insist on regarding time and space as attributes belonging to the
4006: existence of things in themselves, can avoid admitting the fatality of
4007: actions; or if (like the otherwise acute Mendelssohn) they allow
4008: them to be conditions necessarily belonging to the existence of finite
4009: and derived beings, but not to that of the infinite Supreme Being, I
4010: do not see on what ground they can justify such a distinction, or,
4011: indeed, how they can avoid the contradiction that meets them, when
4012: they hold that existence in time is an attribute necessarily belonging
4013: to finite things in themselves, whereas God is the cause of this
4014: existence, but cannot be the cause of time (or space) itself (since
4015: this must be presupposed as a necessary a priori condition of the
4016: existence of things); and consequently as regards the existence of
4017: these things. His causality must be subject to conditions and even
4018: to the condition of time; and this would inevitably bring in
4019: everything contradictory to the notions of His infinity and
4020: independence. On the other hand, it is quite easy for us to draw the
4021: distinction between the attribute of the divine existence of being
4022: independent on all time-conditions, and that of a being of the world
4023: of sense, the distinction being that between the existence of a
4024: being in itself and that of a thing in appearance. Hence, if this
4025: ideality of time and space is not adopted, nothing remains but
4026: Spinozism, in which space and time are essential attributes of the
4027: Supreme Being Himself, and the things dependent on Him (ourselves,
4028: therefore, included) are not substances, but merely accidents inhering
4029: in Him; since, if these things as His effects exist in time only, this
4030: being the condition of their existence in themselves, then the actions
4031: of these beings must be simply His actions which He performs in some
4032: place and time. Thus, Spinozism, in spite of the absurdity of its
4033: fundamental idea, argues more consistently than the creation theory
4034: can, when beings assumed to be substances, and beings in themselves
4035: existing in time, are regarded as effects of a Supreme Cause, and
4036: yet as not [belonging] to Him and His action, but as separate
4037: substances.
4038: 
4039:                                           {BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 50}
4040: 
4041: The above-mentioned difficulty is resolved briefly and clearly as
4042: follows: If existence in time is a mere sensible mode of
4043: representation belonging to thinking beings in the world and
4044: consequently does not apply to them as things in themselves, then
4045: the creation of these beings is a creation of things in themselves,
4046: since the notion of creation does not belong to the sensible form of
4047: representation of existence or to causality, but can only be
4048: referred to noumena. Consequently, when I say of beings in the world
4049: of sense that they are created, I so far regard them as noumena. As it
4050: would be a contradiction, therefore, to say that God is a creator of
4051: appearances, so also it is a contradiction to say that as creator He
4052: is the cause of actions in the world of sense, and therefore as
4053: appearances, although He is the cause of the existence of the acting
4054: beings (which are noumena). If now it is possible to affirm freedom in
4055: spite of the natural mechanism of actions as appearances (by regarding
4056: existence in time as something that belongs only to appearances, not
4057: to things in themselves), then the circumstance that the acting beings
4058: are creatures cannot make the slightest difference, since creation
4059: concerns their supersensible and not their sensible existence, and,
4060: therefore, cannot be regarded as the determining principle of the
4061: appearances. It would be quite different if the beings in the world as
4062: things in themselves existed in time, since in that case the creator
4063: of substance would be at the same time the author of the whole
4064: mechanism of this substance.
4065: 
4066: Of so great importance is the separation of time (as well as
4067: space) from the existence of things in themselves which was effected
4068: in the Critique of the Pure Speculative Reason.
4069: 
4070: It may be said that the solution here proposed involves great
4071: difficulty in itself and is scarcely susceptible of a lucid
4072: exposition. But is any other solution that has been attempted, or that
4073: may be attempted, easier and more intelligible? Rather might we say
4074: that the dogmatic teachers of metaphysics have shown more shrewdness
4075: than candour in keeping this difficult point out of sight as much as
4076: possible, in the hope that if they said nothing about it, probably
4077: no one would think of it. If science is to be advanced, all
4078: difficulties must be laid open, and we must even search for those that
4079: are hidden, for every difficulty calls forth a remedy, which cannot be
4080: discovered without science gaining either in extent or in exactness;
4081: and thus even obstacles become means of increasing the thoroughness of
4082: science. On the other hand, if the difficulties are intentionally
4083: concealed, or merely removed by palliatives, then sooner or later they
4084: burst out into incurable mischiefs, which bring science to ruin in
4085: an absolute scepticism.
4086: 
4087: Since it is, properly speaking, the notion of freedom alone amongst all
4088: the ideas of pure speculative reason that so greatly enlarges our
4089: knowledge in the sphere of the supersensible, though only of our
4090: practical knowledge, I ask myself why it exclusively possesses so great
4091: fertility, whereas the others only designate the vacant space for
4092: possible beings of the pure understanding, but are unable by any means
4093: to define the concept of them. I presently find that as I cannot think
4094: anything without a category, I must first look for a category for the
4095: rational idea of freedom with which I am now concerned; and this is the
4096: category of causality; and although freedom, a concept of the reason,
4097: being a transcendent concept, cannot have any intuition corresponding to
4098: it, yet the concept of the understanding- for the synthesis of which the
4099: former demands the unconditioned- (namely, the concept of causality)
4100: must have a sensible intuition given, by which first its objective
4101: reality is assured. Now, the categories are all divided into two
4102: classes- the mathematical, which concern the unity of synthesis in the
4103: conception of objects, and the dynamical, which refer to the unity of
4104: synthesis in the conception of the existence of objects. The former
4105: (those of magnitude and quality) always contain a synthesis of the
4106: homogeneous, and it is not possible to find in this the unconditioned
4107: antecedent to what is given in sensible intuition as conditioned in
4108: space and time, as this would itself have to belong to space and time,
4109: and therefore be again still conditioned. Whence it resulted in the
4110: Dialectic of Pure Theoretic Reason that the opposite methods of
4111: attaining the unconditioned and the totality of the conditions were both
4112: wrong. The categories of the second class (those of causality and of the
4113: necessity of a thing) did not require this homogeneity (of the
4114: conditioned and the condition in synthesis), since here what we have to
4115: explain is not how the intuition is compounded from a manifold in it,
4116: but only how the existence of the conditioned object corresponding to it
4117: is added to the existence of the condition (added, namely, in the
4118: understanding as connected therewith); and in that case it was allowable
4119: to suppose in the supersensible world the unconditioned antecedent to
4120: the altogether conditioned in the world of sense (both as regards the
4121: causal connection and the contingent existence of things themselves),
4122: although this unconditioned remained indeterminate, and to make the
4123: synthesis transcendent. Hence, it was found in the Dialectic of the Pure
4124: Speculative Reason that the two apparently opposite methods of obtaining
4125: for the conditioned the unconditioned were not really contradictory,
4126: e.g., in the synthesis of causality to conceive for the conditioned in
4127: the series of causes and effects of the sensible world, a causality
4128: which has no sensible condition, and that the same action which, as
4129: belonging to the world of sense, is always sensibly conditioned, that
4130: is, mechanically necessary, yet at the same time may be derived from a
4131: causality not sensibly conditioned- being the causality of the acting
4132: being as belonging to the supersensible world- and may consequently be
4133: conceived as free. Now, the only point in question was to change this
4134: may be into is; that is, that we should be able to show in an actual
4135: case, as it were by a fact, that certain actions imply such a causality
4136: (namely, the intellectual, sensibly unconditioned), whether they are
4137: actual or only commanded, that is, objectively necessary in a practical
4138: sense. We could not hope to find this connexion in actions actually
4139: given in experience as events of the sensible world, since causality
4140: with freedom must always be sought outside the world of sense in the
4141: world of intelligence. But things of sense are the only things offered
4142: to our perception and observation. Hence, nothing remained but to find
4143: an incontestable objective principle of causality which excludes all
4144: sensible conditions: that is, a principle in which reason does not
4145: appeal further to something else as a determining ground of its
4146: causality, but contains this determining ground itself by means of that
4147: principle, and in which therefore it is itself as pure reason practical.
4148: Now, this principle had not to be searched for or discovered; it had
4149: long been in the reason of all men, and incorporated in their nature,
4150: and is the principle of morality. Therefore, that unconditioned
4151: causality, with the faculty of it, namely, freedom, is no longer merely
4152: indefinitely and problematically thought (this speculative reason could
4153: prove to be feasible), but is even as regards the law of its causality
4154: definitely and assertorially known; and with it the fact that a being (I
4155: myself), belonging to the world of sense, belongs also to the
4156: supersensible world, this is also positively known, and thus the reality
4157: of the supersensible world is established and in practical respects
4158: definitely given, and this definiteness, which for theoretical purposes
4159: would be transcendent, is for practical purposes immanent. We could not,
4160: however, make a similar step as regards the second dynamical idea,
4161: namely, that of a necessary being. We could not rise to it from the
4162: sensible world without the aid of the first dynamical idea. For if we
4163: attempted to do so, we should have ventured to leave at a bound all that
4164: is given to us, and to leap to that of which nothing is given us that
4165: can help us to effect the connection of such a supersensible being with
4166: the world of sense (since the necessary being would have to be known as
4167: given outside ourselves). On the other hand, it is now obvious that this
4168: connection is quite possible in relation to our own subject, inasmuch as
4169: I know myself to be on the one side as an intelligible [supersensible]
4170: being determined by the moral law (by means of freedom), and on the
4171: other side as acting in the world of sense. It is the concept of freedom
4172: alone that enables us to find the unconditioned and intelligible for the
4173: conditioned and sensible without going out of ourselves. For it is our
4174: own reason that by means of the supreme and unconditional practical law
4175: knows that itself and the being that is conscious of this law (our own
4176: person) belong to the pure world of understanding, and moreover defines
4177: the manner in which, as such, it can be active. In this way it can be
4178: understood why in the whole faculty of reason it is the practical reason
4179: only that can help us to pass beyond the world of sense and give us
4180: knowledge of a supersensible order and connection, which, however, for
4181: this very reason cannot be extended further than is necessary for pure
4182: practical purposes.
4183: 
4184: Let me be permitted on this occasion to make one more remark,
4185: namely, that every step that we make with pure reason, even in the
4186: practical sphere where no attention is paid to subtle speculation,
4187: nevertheless accords with all the material points of the Critique of
4188: the Theoretical Reason as closely and directly as if each step had
4189: been thought out with deliberate purpose to establish this
4190: confirmation. Such a thorough agreement, wholly unsought for and quite
4191: obvious (as anyone can convince himself, if he will only carry moral
4192: inquiries up to their principles), between the most important
4193: proposition of practical reason and the often seemingly too subtle and
4194: needless remarks of the Critique of the Speculative Reason,
4195: occasions surprise and astonishment, and confirms the maxim already
4196: recognized and praised by others, namely, that in every scientific
4197: inquiry we should pursue our way steadily with all possible
4198: exactness and frankness, without caring for any objections that may be
4199: raised from outside its sphere, but, as far as we can, to carry out
4200: our inquiry truthfully and completely by itself. Frequent
4201: observation has convinced me that, when such researches are concluded,
4202: that which in one part of them appeared to me very questionable,
4203: considered in relation to other extraneous doctrines, when I left this
4204: doubtfulness out of sight for a time and only attended to the business
4205: in hand until it was completed, at last was unexpectedly found to
4206: agree perfectly with what had been discovered separately without the
4207: least regard to those doctrines, and without any partiality or
4208: prejudice for them. Authors would save themselves many errors and much
4209: labour lost (because spent on a delusion) if they could only resolve
4210: to go to work with more frankness.

4215: 
4216: 
4217: 
4218: CHAPTER I. Of a Dialectic of Pure Practical Reason Generally.
4219: 
4220: 
4221: 
4222: Pure reason always has its dialetic, whether it is considered in its
4223: speculative or its practical employment; for it requires the
4224: absolute totality of the 'conditions of what is given conditioned, and
4225: this can only be found in things in themselves. But as all conceptions
4226: of things in themselves must be referred to intuitions, and with us
4227: men these can never be other than sensible and hence can never
4228: enable us to know objects as things in themselves but only as
4229: appearances, and since the unconditioned can never be found in this
4230: chain of appearances which consists only of conditioned and
4231: conditions; thus from applying this rational idea of the totality of
4232: the conditions (in other words of the unconditioned) to appearances,
4233: there arises an inevitable illusion, as if these latter were things in
4234: themselves (for in the absence of a warning critique they are always
4235: regarded as such). This illusion would never be noticed as delusive if
4236: it did not betray itself by a conflict of reason with itself, when
4237: it applies to appearances its fundamental principle of presupposing
4238: the unconditioned to everything conditioned. By this, however,
4239: reason is compelled to trace this illusion to its source, and search
4240: how it can be removed, and this can only be done by a complete
4241: critical examination of the whole pure faculty of reason; so that
4242: the antinomy of the pure reason which is manifest in its dialectic
4243: is in fact the most beneficial error into which human reason could
4244: ever have fallen, since it at last drives us to search for the key
4245: to escape from this labyrinth; and when this key is found, it
4246: further discovers that which we did not seek but yet had need of,
4247: namely, a view into a higher and an immutable order of things, in
4248: which we even now are, and in which we are thereby enabled by definite
4249: precepts to continue to live according to the highest dictates of
4250: reason.
4251: 
4252: It may be seen in detail in the Critique of Pure Reason how in its
4253: speculative employment this natural dialectic is to be solved, and how
4254: the error which arises from a very natural illusion may be guarded
4255: against. But reason in its practical use is not a whit better off.
4256: As pure practical reason, it likewise seeks to find the
4257: unconditioned for the practically conditioned (which rests on
4258: inclinations and natural wants), and this is not as the determining
4259: principle of the will, but even when this is given (in the moral
4260: law) it seeks the unconditioned totality of the object of pure
4261: practical reason under the name of the summum bonum.
4262: 
4263: To define this idea practically, i.e., sufficiently for the maxims
4264: of our rational conduct, is the business of practical wisdom, and this
4265: again as a science is philosophy, in the sense in which the word was
4266: understood by the ancients, with whom it meant instruction in the
4267: conception in which the summum bonum was to be placed, and the conduct
4268: by which it was to be obtained. It would be well to leave this word in
4269: its ancient signification as a doctrine of the summum bonum, so far as
4270: reason endeavours to make this into a science. For on the one hand the
4271: restriction annexed would suit the Greek expression (which signifies
4272: the love of wisdom), and yet at the same time would be sufficient to
4273: embrace under the name of philosophy the love of science: that is to
4274: say, of all speculative rational knowledge, so far as it is
4275: serviceable to reason, both for that conception and also for the
4276: practical principle determining our conduct, without letting out of
4277: sight the main end, on account of which alone it can be called a
4278: doctrine of practical wisdom. On the other hand, it would be no harm
4279: to deter the self-conceit of one who ventures to claim the title of
4280: philosopher by holding before him in the very definition a standard of
4281: self-estimation which would very much lower his pretensions. For a
4282: teacher of wisdom would mean something more than a scholar who has not
4283: come so far as to guide himself, much less to guide others, with
4284: certain expectation of attaining so high an end: it would mean a
4285: master in the knowledge of wisdom, which implies more than a modest
4286: man would claim for himself. Thus philosophy as well as wisdom would
4287: always remain an ideal, which objectively is presented complete in
4288: reason alone, while subjectively for the person it is only the goal of
4289: his unceasing endeavours; and no one would be justified in
4290: professing to be in possession of it so as to assume the name of
4291: philosopher who could not also show its infallible effects in his
4292: own person as an example (in his self-mastery and the unquestioned
4293: interest that he takes pre-eminently in the general good), and this
4294: the ancients also required as a condition of deserving that honourable
4295: title.

4297:                                            {BOOK_2|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 5}
4298: 
4299: We have another preliminary remark to make respecting the
4300: dialectic of the pure practical reason, on the point of the definition
4301: of the summum bonum (a successful solution of which dialectic would
4302: lead us to expect, as in case of that of the theoretical reason, the
4303: most beneficial effects, inasmuch as the self-contradictions of pure
4304: practical reason honestly stated, and not concealed, force us to
4305: undertake a complete critique of this faculty).
4306: 
4307: The moral law is the sole determining principle of a pure will.
4308: But since this is merely formal (viz., as prescribing only the form of
4309: the maxim as universally legislative), it abstracts as a determining
4310: principle from all matter that is to say, from every object of
4311: volition. Hence, though the summum bonum may be the whole object of
4312: a pure practical reason, i.e., a pure will, yet it is not on that
4313: account to be regarded as its determining principle; and the moral law
4314: alone must be regarded as the principle on which that and its
4315: realization or promotion are aimed at. This remark is important in
4316: so delicate a case as the determination of moral principles, where the
4317: slightest misinterpretation perverts men's minds. For it will have
4318: been seen from the Analytic that, if we assume any object under the
4319: name of a good as a determining principle of the will prior to the
4320: moral law and then deduce from it the supreme practical principle,
4321: this would always introduce heteronomy and crush out the moral
4322: principle.
4323: 
4324: It is, however, evident that if the notion of the summum bonum
4325: includes that of the moral law as its supreme condition, then the
4326: summum bonum would not merely be an object, but the notion of it and
4327: the conception of its existence as possible by our own practical
4328: reason would likewise be the determining principle of the will,
4329: since in that case the will is in fact determined by the moral law
4330: which is already included in this conception, and by no other
4331: object, as the principle of autonomy requires. This order of the
4332: conceptions of determination of the will must not be lost sight of, as
4333: otherwise we should misunderstand ourselves and think we had fallen
4334: into a contradiction, while everything remains in perfect harmony.

4337: 
4338:   CHAPTER II. Of the Dialectic of Pure Reason in defining the
4339: 
4340:             Conception of the "Summum Bonum".
4341: 
4342: 
4343: 
4344: The conception of the summum itself contains an ambiguity which
4345: might occasion needless disputes if we did not attend to it. The
4346: summum may mean either the supreme (supremum) or the perfect
4347: (consummatum). The former is that condition which is itself
4348: unconditioned, i.e., is not subordinate to any other (originarium);
4349: the second is that whole which is not a part of a greater whole of the
4350: same kind (perfectissimum). It has been shown in the Analytic that
4351: virtue (as worthiness to be happy) is the supreme condition of all
4352: that can appear to us desirable, and consequently of all our pursuit
4353: of happiness, and is therefore the supreme good. But it does not
4354: follow that it is the whole and perfect good as the object of the
4355: desires of rational finite beings; for this requires happiness also,
4356: and that not merely in the partial eyes of the person who makes
4357: himself an end, but even in the judgement of an impartial reason,
4358: which regards persons in general as ends in themselves. For to need
4359: happiness, to deserve it, and yet at the same time not to
4360: participate in it, cannot be consistent with the perfect volition of a
4361: rational being possessed at the same time of all power, if, for the
4362: sake of experiment, we conceive such a being. Now inasmuch as virtue
4363: and happiness together constitute the possession of the summum bonum
4364: in a person, and the distribution of happiness in exact proportion
4365: to morality (which is the worth of the person, and his worthiness to
4366: be happy) constitutes the summum bonum of a possible world; hence this
4367: summum bonum expresses the whole, the perfect good, in which, however,
4368: virtue as the condition is always the supreme good, since it has no
4369: condition above it; whereas happiness, while it is pleasant to the
4370: possessor of it, is not of itself absolutely and in all respects good,
4371: but always presupposes morally right behaviour as its condition.
4372: 
4373: When two elements are necessarily united in one concept, they must
4374: be connected as reason and consequence, and this either so that
4375: their unity is considered as analytical (logical connection), or as
4376: synthetical (real connection) the former following the law of
4377: identity, the latter that of causality. The connection of virtue and
4378: happiness may therefore be understood in two ways: either the
4379: endeavour to be virtuous and the rational pursuit of happiness are not
4380: two distinct actions, but absolutely identical, in which case no maxim
4381: need be made the principle of the former, other than what serves for
4382: the latter; or the connection consists in this, that virtue produces
4383: happiness as something distinct from the consciousness of virtue, as a
4384: cause produces an effect.
4385: 
4386: The ancient Greek schools were, properly speaking, only two, and
4387: in determining the conception of the summum bonum these followed in
4388: fact one and the same method, inasmuch as they did not allow virtue
4389: and happiness to be regarded as two distinct elements of the summum
4390: bonum, and consequently sought the unity of the principle by the
4391: rule of identity; but they differed as to which of the two was to be
4392: taken as the fundamental notion. The Epicurean said: "To be
4393: conscious that one's maxims lead to happiness is virtue"; the Stoic
4394: said: "To be conscious of one's virtue is happiness." With the former,
4395: Prudence was equivalent to morality; with the latter, who chose a
4396: higher designation for virtue, morality alone was true wisdom.
4397: 
4398: While we must admire the men who in such early times tried all
4399: imaginable ways of extending the domain of philosophy, we must at
4400: the same time lament that their acuteness was unfortunately misapplied
4401: in trying to trace out identity between two extremely heterogeneous
4402: notions, those of happiness and virtue. But it agrees with the
4403: dialectical spirit of their times (and subtle minds are even now
4404: sometimes misled in the same way) to get rid of irreconcilable
4405: differences in principle by seeking to change them into a mere contest
4406: about words, and thus apparently working out the identity of the
4407: notion under different names, and this usually occurs in cases where
4408: the combination of heterogeneous principles lies so deep or so high,
4409: or would require so complete a transformation of the doctrines assumed
4410: in the rest of the philosophical system, that men are afraid to
4411: penetrate deeply into the real difference and prefer treating it as
4412: a difference in questions of form.
4413: 
4414:                                            {BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 5}
4415: 
4416: While both schools sought to trace out the identity of the practical
4417: principles of virtue and happiness, they were not agreed as to the way
4418: in which they tried to force this identity, but were separated
4419: infinitely from one another, the one placing its principle on the side
4420: of sense, the other on that of reason; the one in the consciousness of
4421: sensible wants, the other in the independence of practical reason on
4422: all sensible grounds of determination. According to the Epicurean, the
4423: notion of virtue was already involved in the maxim: "To promote
4424: one's own happiness"; according to the Stoics, on the other hand,
4425: the feeling of happiness was already contained in the consciousness of
4426: virtue. Now whatever is contained in another notion is identical
4427: with part of the containing notion, but not with the whole, and
4428: moreover two wholes may be specifically distinct, although they
4429: consist of the same parts; namely if the parts are united into a whole
4430: in totally different ways. The Stoic maintained that the virtue was
4431: the whole summum bonum, and happiness only the consciousness of
4432: possessing it, as making part of the state of the subject. The
4433: Epicurean maintained that happiness was the whole summum bonum, and
4434: virtue only the form of the maxim for its pursuit; viz., the
4435: rational use of the means for attaining it.
4436: 
4437: Now it is clear from the Analytic that the maxims of virtue and
4438: those of private happiness are quite heterogeneous as to their supreme
4439: practical principle, and, although they belong to one summum bonum
4440: which together they make possible, yet they are so far from coinciding
4441: that they restrict and check one another very much in the same
4442: subject. Thus the question: "How is the summum bonum practically
4443: possible?" still remains an unsolved problem, notwithstanding all
4444: the attempts at coalition that have hitherto been made. The Analytic
4445: has, however, shown what it is that makes the problem difficult to
4446: solve; namely, that happiness and morality are two specifically
4447: distinct elements of the summum bonum and, therefore, their
4448: combination cannot be analytically cognised (as if the man that
4449: seeks his own happiness should find by mere analysis of his conception
4450: that in so acting he is virtuous, or as if the man that follows virtue
4451: should in the consciousness of such conduct find that he is already
4452: happy ipso facto), but must be a synthesis of concepts. Now since this
4453: combination is recognised as a priori, and therefore as practically
4454: necessary, and consequently not as derived from experience, so that
4455: the possibility of the summum bonum does not rest on any empirical
4456: principle, it follows that the deduction [legitimation] of this
4457: concept must be transcendental. It is a priori (morally) necessary
4458: to produce the summum bonum by freedom of will: therefore the
4459: condition of its possibility must rest solely on a priori principles
4460: of cognition.

4469: 
4470: In the summum bonum which is practical for us, i.e., to be
4471: realized by our will, virtue and happiness are thought as
4472: necessarily combined, so that the one cannot be assumed by pure
4473: practical reason without the other also being attached to it. Now this
4474: combination (like every other) is either analytical or synthetical. It
4475: has been shown that it cannot be analytical; it must then be
4476: synthetical and, more particularly, must be conceived as the
4477: connection of cause and effect, since it concerns a practical good,
4478: i.e., one that is possible by means of action; consequently either the
4479: desire of happiness must be the motive to maxims of virtue, or the
4480: maxim of virtue must be the efficient cause of happiness. The first is
4481: absolutely impossible, because (as was proved in the Analytic)
4482: maxims which place the determining principle of the will in the desire
4483: of personal happiness are not moral at all, and no virtue can be
4484: founded on them. But the second is also impossible, because the
4485: practical connection of causes and effects in the world, as the result
4486: of the determination of the will, does not depend upon the moral
4487: dispositions of the will, but on the knowledge of the laws of nature
4488: and the physical power to use them for one's purposes; consequently we
4489: cannot expect in the world by the most punctilious observance of the
4490: moral laws any necessary connection of happiness with virtue
4491: adequate to the summum bonum. Now, as the promotion of this summum
4492: bonum, the conception of which contains this connection, is a priori a
4493: necessary object of our will and inseparably attached to the moral
4494: law, the impossibility of the former must prove the falsity of the
4495: latter. If then the supreme good is not possible by practical rules,
4496: then the moral law also which commands us to promote it is directed to
4497: vain imaginary ends and must consequently be false.

4500: 
4501:  II. Critical Solution of the Antinomy of Practical Reason.
4502: 
4503: 
4504: 
4505: The antinomy of pure speculative reason exhibits a similar
4506: conflict between freedom and physical necessity in the causality of
4507: events in the world. It was solved by showing that there is no real
4508: contradiction when the events and even the world in which they occur
4509: are regarded (as they ought to be) merely as appearances; since one
4510: and the same acting being, as an appearance (even to his own inner
4511: sense), has a causality in the world of sense that always conforms
4512: to the mechanism of nature, but with respect to the same events, so
4513: far as the acting person regards himself at the same time as a
4514: noumenon (as pure intelligence in an existence not dependent on the
4515: condition of time), he can contain a principle by which that causality
4516: acting according to laws of nature is determined, but which is
4517: itself free from all laws of nature.
4518: 
4519:                                           {BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 15}
4520: 
4521: It is just the same with the foregoing antinomy of pure practical
4522: reason. The first of the two propositions, "That the endeavour after
4523: happiness produces a virtuous mind," is absolutely false; but the
4524: second, "That a virtuous mind necessarily produces happiness," is
4525: not absolutely false, but only in so far as virtue is considered as
4526: a form of causality in the sensible world, and consequently only if
4527: I suppose existence in it to be the only sort of existence of a
4528: rational being; it is then only conditionally false. But as I am not
4529: only justified in thinking that I exist also as a noumenon in a
4530: world of the understanding, but even have in the moral law a purely
4531: intellectual determining principle of my causality (in the sensible
4532: world), it is not impossible that morality of mind should have a
4533: connection as cause with happiness (as an effect in the sensible
4534: world) if not immediate yet mediate (viz., through an intelligent
4535: author of nature), and moreover necessary; while in a system of nature
4536: which is merely an object of the senses, this combination could
4537: never occur except contingently and, therefore, could not suffice
4538: for the summum bonum.
4539: 
4540: Thus, notwithstanding this seeming conflict of practical reason with
4541: itself, the summum bonum, which is the necessary supreme end of a will
4542: morally determined, is a true object thereof; for it is practically
4543: possible, and the maxims of the will which as regards their matter
4544: refer to it have objective reality, which at first was threatened by
4545: the antinomy that appeared in the connection of morality with
4546: happiness by a general law; but this was merely from a
4547: misconception, because the relation between appearances was taken
4548: for a relation of the things in themselves to these appearances.
4549: 
4550: When we find ourselves obliged to go so far, namely, to the
4551: connection with an intelligible world, to find the possibility of
4552: the summum bonum, which reason points out to all rational beings as
4553: the goal of all their moral wishes, it must seem strange that,
4554: nevertheless, the philosophers both of ancient and modern times have
4555: been able to find happiness in accurate proportion to virtue even in
4556: this life (in the sensible world), or have persuaded themselves that
4557: they were conscious thereof. For Epicurus as well as the Stoics
4558: extolled above everything the happiness that springs from the
4559: consciousness of living virtuously; and the former was not so base
4560: in his practical precepts as one might infer from the principles of
4561: his theory, which he used for explanation and not for action, or as
4562: they were interpreted by many who were misled by his using the term
4563: pleasure for contentment; on the contrary, he reckoned the most
4564: disinterested practice of good amongst the ways of enjoying the most
4565: intimate delight, and his scheme of pleasure (by which he meant
4566: constant cheerfulness of mind) included the moderation and control
4567: of the inclinations, such as the strictest moral philosopher might
4568: require. He differed from the Stoics chiefly in making this pleasure
4569: the motive, which they very rightly refused to do. For, on the one
4570: hand, the virtuous Epicurus, like many well-intentioned men of this
4571: day who do not reflect deeply enough on their principles, fell into
4572: the error of presupposing the virtuous disposition in the persons
4573: for whom he wished to provide the springs to virtue (and indeed the
4574: upright man cannot be happy if he is not first conscious of his
4575: uprightness; since with such a character the reproach that his habit
4576: of thought would oblige him to make against himself in case of
4577: transgression and his moral self-condemnation would rob him of all
4578: enjoyment of the pleasantness which his condition might otherwise
4579: contain). But the question is: How is such a disposition possible in
4580: the first instance, and such a habit of thought in estimating the
4581: worth of one's existence, since prior to it there can be in the
4582: subject no feeling at all for moral worth? If a man is virtuous
4583: without being conscious of his integrity in every action, he will
4584: certainly not enjoy life, however favourable fortune may be to him
4585: in its physical circumstances; but can we make him virtuous in the
4586: first instance, in other words, before he esteems the moral worth of
4587: his existence so highly, by praising to him the peace of mind that
4588: would result from the consciousness of an integrity for which he has
4589: no sense?
4590: 
4591: On the other hand, however, there is here an occasion of a vitium
4592: subreptionis, and as it were of an optical illusion, in the
4593: self-consciousness of what one does as distinguished from what one
4594: feels- an illusion which even the most experienced cannot altogether
4595: avoid. The moral disposition of mind is necessarily combined with a
4596: consciousness that the will is determined directly by the law. Now the
4597: consciousness of a determination of the faculty of desire is always
4598: the source of a satisfaction in the resulting action; but this
4599: pleasure, this satisfaction in oneself, is not the determining
4600: principle of the action; on the contrary, the determination of the
4601: will directly by reason is the source of the feeling of pleasure,
4602: and this remains a pure practical not sensible determination of the
4603: faculty of desire. Now as this determination has exactly the same
4604: effect within in impelling to activity, that a feeling of the pleasure
4605: to be expected from the desired action would have had, we easily
4606: look on what we ourselves do as something which we merely passively
4607: feel, and take the moral spring for a sensible impulse, just as it
4608: happens in the so-called illusion of the senses (in this case the
4609: inner sense). It is a sublime thing in human nature to be determined
4610: to actions immediately by a purely rational law; sublime even is the
4611: illusion that regards the subjective side of this capacity of
4612: intellectual determination as something sensible and the effect of a
4613: special sensible feeling (for an intellectual feeling would be a
4614: contradiction). It is also of great importance to attend to this
4615: property of our personality and as much as possible to cultivate the
4616: effect of reason on this feeling. But we must beware lest by falsely
4617: extolling this moral determining principle as a spring, making its
4618: source lie in particular feelings of pleasure (which are in fact
4619: only results), we degrade and disfigure the true genuine spring, the
4620: law itself, by putting as it were a false foil upon it. Respect, not
4621: pleasure or enjoyment of happiness, is something for which it is not
4622: possible that reason should have any antecedent feeling as its
4623: foundation (for this would always be sensible and pathological); and
4624: consciousness of immediate obligation of the will by the law is by
4625: no means analogous to the feeling of pleasure, although in relation to
4626: the faculty of desire it produces the same effect, but from
4627: different sources: it is only by this mode of conception, however,
4628: that we can attain what we are seeking, namely, that actions be done
4629: not merely in accordance with duty (as a result of pleasant feelings),
4630: but from duty, which must be the true end of all moral cultivation.
4631: 
4632: Have we not, however, a word which does not express enjoyment, as
4633: happiness does, but indicates a satisfaction in one's existence, an
4634: analogue of the happiness which must necessarily accompany the
4635: consciousness of virtue? Yes this word is self-contentment which in
4636: its proper signification always designates only a negative
4637: satisfaction in one's existence, in which one is conscious of
4638: needing nothing. Freedom and the consciousness of it as a faculty of
4639: following the moral law with unyielding resolution is independence
4640: of inclinations, at least as motives determining (though not as
4641: affecting) our desire, and so far as I am conscious of this freedom in
4642: following my moral maxims, it is the only source of an unaltered
4643: contentment which is necessarily connected with it and rests on no
4644: special feeling. This may be called intellectual contentment. The
4645: sensible contentment (improperly so-called) which rests on the
4646: satisfaction of the inclinations, however delicate they may be
4647: imagined to be, can never be adequate to the conception of it. For the
4648: inclinations change, they grow with the indulgence shown them, and
4649: always leave behind a still greater void than we had thought to
4650: fill. Hence they are always burdensome to a rational being, and,
4651: although he cannot lay them aside, they wrest from him the wish to
4652: be rid of them. Even an inclination to what is right (e.g., to
4653: beneficence), though it may much facilitate the efficacy of the
4654: moral maxims, cannot produce any. For in these all must be directed to
4655: the conception of the law as a determining principle, if the action is
4656: to contain morality and not merely legality. Inclination is blind
4657: and slavish, whether it be of a good sort or not, and, when morality
4658: is in question, reason must not play the part merely of guardian to
4659: inclination, but disregarding it altogether must attend simply to
4660: its own interest as pure practical reason. This very feeling of
4661: compassion and tender sympathy, if it precedes the deliberation on the
4662: question of duty and becomes a determining principle, is even annoying
4663: to right thinking persons, brings their deliberate maxims into
4664: confusion, and makes them wish to be delivered from it and to be
4665: subject to lawgiving reason alone.
4666: 
4667:                                           {BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 20}
4668: 
4669: From this we can understand how the consciousness of this faculty of
4670: a pure practical reason produces by action (virtue) a consciousness of
4671: mastery over one's inclinations, and therefore of independence of
4672: them, and consequently also of the discontent that always
4673: accompanies them, and thus a negative satisfaction with one's state,
4674: i.e., contentment, which is primarily contentment with one's own
4675: person. Freedom itself becomes in this way (namely, indirectly)
4676: capable of an enjoyment which cannot be called happiness, because it
4677: does not depend on the positive concurrence of a feeling, nor is it,
4678: strictly speaking, bliss, since it does not include complete
4679: independence of inclinations and wants, but it resembles bliss in so
4680: far as the determination of one's will at least can hold itself free
4681: from their influence; and thus, at least in its origin, this enjoyment
4682: is analogous to the self-sufficiency which we can ascribe only to
4683: the Supreme Being.
4684: 
4685: From this solution of the antinomy of practical pure reason, it
4686: follows that in practical principles we may at least conceive as
4687: possible a natural and necessary connection between the
4688: consciousness of morality and the expectation of a proportionate
4689: happiness as its result, though it does not follow that we can know or
4690: perceive this connection; that, on the other hand, principles of the
4691: pursuit of happiness cannot possibly produce morality; that,
4692: therefore, morality is the supreme good (as the first condition of the
4693: summum bonum), while happiness constitutes its second element, but
4694: only in such a way that it is the morally conditioned, but necessary
4695: consequence of the former. Only with this subordination is the
4696: summum bonum the whole object of pure practical reason, which must
4697: necessarily conceive it as possible, since it commands us to
4698: contribute to the utmost of our power to its realization. But since
4699: the possibility of such connection of the conditioned with its
4700: condition belongs wholly to the supersensual relation of things and
4701: cannot be given according to the laws of the world of sense,
4702: although the practical consequences of the idea belong to the world of
4703: sense, namely, the actions that aim at realizing the summum bonum;
4704: we will therefore endeavour to set forth the grounds of that
4705: possibility, first, in respect of what is immediately in our power,
4706: and then, secondly, in that which is not in our power, but which
4707: reason presents to us as the supplement of our impotence, for the
4708: realization of the summum bonum (which by practical principles is
4709: necessary).

4718: 
4719: 
4720: 
4721: By primacy between two or more things connected by reason, I
4722: understand the prerogative, belonging to one, of being the first
4723: determining principle in the connection with all the rest. In a
4724: narrower practical sense it means the prerogative of the interest of
4725: one in so far as the interest of the other is subordinated to it,
4726: while it is not postponed to any other. To every faculty of the mind
4727: we can attribute an interest, that is, a principle, that contains
4728: the condition on which alone the former is called into exercise.
4729: Reason, as the faculty of principles, determines the interest of all
4730: the powers of the mind and is determined by its own. The interest of
4731: its speculative employment consists in the cognition of the object
4732: pushed to the highest a priori principles: that of its practical
4733: employment, in the determination of the will in respect of the final
4734: and complete end. As to what is necessary for the possibility of any
4735: employment of reason at all, namely, that its principles and
4736: affirmations should not contradict one another, this constitutes no
4737: part of its interest, but is the condition of having reason at all; it
4738: is only its development, not mere consistency with itself, that is
4739: reckoned as its interest.
4740: 
4741: If practical reason could not assume or think as given anything
4742: further than what speculative reason of itself could offer it from its
4743: own insight, the latter would have the primacy. But supposing that
4744: it had of itself original a priori principles with which certain
4745: theoretical positions were inseparably connected, while these were
4746: withdrawn from any possible insight of speculative reason (which,
4747: however, they must not contradict); then the question is: Which
4748: interest is the superior (not which must give way, for they are not
4749: necessarily conflicting), whether speculative reason, which knows
4750: nothing of all that the practical offers for its acceptance, should
4751: take up these propositions and (although they transcend it) try to
4752: unite them with its own concepts as a foreign possession handed over
4753: to it, or whether it is justified in obstinately following its own
4754: separate interest and, according to the canonic of Epicurus, rejecting
4755: as vain subtlety everything that cannot accredit its objective reality
4756: by manifest examples to be shown in experience, even though it
4757: should be never so much interwoven with the interest of the
4758: practical (pure) use of reason, and in itself not contradictory to the
4759: theoretical, merely because it infringes on the interest of the
4760: speculative reason to this extent, that it removes the bounds which
4761: this latter had set to itself, and gives it up to every nonsense or
4762: delusion of imagination?
4763: 
4764: In fact, so far as practical reason is taken as dependent on
4765: pathological conditions, that is, as merely regulating the
4766: inclinations under the sensible principle of happiness, we could not
4767: require speculative reason to take its principles from such a
4768: source. Mohammed's paradise, or the absorption into the Deity of the
4769: theosophists and mystics would press their monstrosities on the reason
4770: according to the taste of each, and one might as well have no reason
4771: as surrender it in such fashion to all sorts of dreams. But if pure
4772: reason of itself can be practical and is actually so, as the
4773: consciousness of the moral law proves, then it is still only one and
4774: the same reason which, whether in a theoretical or a practical point
4775: of view, judges according to a priori principles; and then it is clear
4776: that although it is in the first point of view incompetent to
4777: establish certain propositions positively, which, however, do not
4778: contradict it, then, as soon as these propositions are inseparably
4779: attached to the practical interest of pure reason, it must accept
4780: them, though it be as something offered to it from a foreign source,
4781: something that has not grown on its own ground, but yet is
4782: sufficiently authenticated; and it must try to compare and connect
4783: them with everything that it has in its power as speculative reason.
4784: It must remember, however, that these are not additions to its
4785: insight, but yet are extensions of its employment in another,
4786: namely, a practical aspect; and this is not in the least opposed to
4787: its interest, which consists in the restriction of wild speculation.
4788: 
4789: Thus, when pure speculative and pure practical reason are combined
4790: in one cognition, the latter has the primacy, provided, namely, that
4791: this combination is not contingent and arbitrary, but founded a priori
4792: on reason itself and therefore necessary. For without this
4793: subordination there would arise a conflict of reason with itself;
4794: since, if they were merely co-ordinate, the former would close its
4795: boundaries strictly and admit nothing from the latter into its domain,
4796: while the latter would extend its bounds over everything and when
4797: its needs required would seek to embrace the former within them. Nor
4798: could we reverse the order and require pure practical reason to be
4799: subordinate to the speculative, since all interest is ultimately
4800: practical, and even that of speculative reason is conditional, and
4801: it is only in the practical employment of reason that it is complete.

4811: 
4812: 
4813: The realization of the summum bonum in the world is the necessary
4814: object of a will determinable by the moral law. But in this will the
4815: perfect accordance of the mind with the moral law is the supreme
4816: condition of the summum bonum. This then must be possible, as well
4817: as its object, since it is contained in the command to promote the
4818: latter. Now, the perfect accordance of the will with the moral law
4819: is holiness, a perfection of which no rational being of the sensible
4820: world is capable at any moment of his existence. Since,
4821: nevertheless, it is required as practically necessary, it can only
4822: be found in a progress in infinitum towards that perfect accordance,
4823: and on the principles of pure practical reason it is necessary to
4824: assume such a practical progress as the real object of our will.
4825: 
4826:                                           {BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 35}
4827: 
4828: Now, this endless progress is only possible on the supposition of an
4829: endless duration of the existence and personality of the same rational
4830: being (which is called the immortality of the soul). The summum bonum,
4831: then, practically is only possible on the supposition of the
4832: immortality of the soul; consequently this immortality, being
4833: inseparably connected with the moral law, is a postulate of pure
4834: practical reason (by which I mean a theoretical proposition, not
4835: demonstrable as such, but which is an inseparable result of an
4836: unconditional a priori practical law.
4837: 
4838: This principle of the moral destination of our nature, namely,
4839: that it is only in an endless progress that we can attain perfect
4840: accordance with the moral law, is of the greatest use, not merely
4841: for the present purpose of supplementing the impotence of
4842: speculative reason, but also with respect to religion. In default of
4843: it, either the moral law is quite degraded from its holiness, being
4844: made out to be indulgent and conformable to our convenience, or else
4845: men strain their notions of their vocation and their expectation to an
4846: unattainable goal, hoping to acquire complete holiness of will, and so
4847: they lose themselves in fanatical theosophic dreams, which wholly
4848: contradict self-knowledge. In both cases the unceasing effort to
4849: obey punctually and thoroughly a strict and inflexible command of
4850: reason, which yet is not ideal but real, is only hindered. For a
4851: rational but finite being, the only thing possible is an endless
4852: progress from the lower to higher degrees of moral perfection. The
4853: Infinite Being, to whom the condition of time is nothing, sees in this
4854: to us endless succession a whole of accordance with the moral law; and
4855: the holiness which his command inexorably requires, in order to be
4856: true to his justice in the share which He assigns to each in the
4857: summum bonum, is to be found in a single intellectual intuition of the
4858: whole existence of rational beings. All that can be expected of the
4859: creature in respect of the hope of this participation would be the
4860: consciousness of his tried character, by which from the progress he
4861: has hitherto made from the worse to the morally better, and the
4862: immutability of purpose which has thus become known to him, he may
4863: hope for a further unbroken continuance of the same, however long
4864: his existence may last, even beyond this life, * and thus he may
4865: hope, not indeed here, nor in any imaginable point of his future
4866: existence, but only in the endlessness of his duration (which God
4867: alone can survey) to be perfectly adequate to his will (without
4868: indulgence or excuse, which do not harmonize with justice).
4869: 
4870: 
4871: 
4872: * It seems, nevertheless, impossible for a creature to have the
4873: conviction of his unwavering firmness of mind in the progress
4874: towards goodness. On this account the Christian religion makes it come
4875: only from the same Spirit that works sanctification, that is, this
4876: firm purpose, and with it the consciousness of steadfastness in the
4877: moral progress. But naturally one who is conscious that he has
4878: persevered through a long portion of his life up to the end in the
4879: progress to the better, and this genuine moral motives, may well
4880: have the comforting hope, though not the certainty, that even in an
4881: existence prolonged beyond this life he will continue in these
4882: principles; and although he is never justified here in his own eyes,
4883: nor can ever hope to be so in the increased perfection of his
4884: nature, to which he looks forward, together with an increase of
4885: duties, nevertheless in this progress which, though it is directed
4886: to a goal infinitely remote, yet is in God's sight regarded as
4887: equivalent to possession, he may have a prospect of a blessed
4888: future; for this is the word that reason employs to designate
4889: perfect well-being independent of all contingent causes of the
4890: world, and which, like holiness, is an idea that can be contained only
4891: in an endless progress and its totality, and consequently is never
4892: fully attained by a creature.

4898: V. The Existence of God as a Postulate of Pure Practical Reason.
4899: 
4900: 
4901: 
4902: In the foregoing analysis the moral law led to a practical problem
4903: which is prescribed by pure reason alone, without the aid of any
4904: sensible motives, namely, that of the necessary completeness of the
4905: first and principle element of the summum bonum, viz., morality;
4906: and, as this can be perfectly solved only in eternity, to the
4907: postulate of immortality. The same law must also lead us to affirm the
4908: possibility of the second element of the summum bonum, viz., happiness
4909: proportioned to that morality, and this on grounds as disinterested as
4910: before, and solely from impartial reason; that is, it must lead to the
4911: supposition of the existence of a cause adequate to this effect; in
4912: other words, it must postulate the existence of God, as the
4913: necessary condition of the possibility of the summum bonum (an
4914: object of the will which is necessarily connected with the moral
4915: legislation of pure reason). We proceed to exhibit this connection
4916: in a convincing manner.
4917: 
4918: Happiness is the condition of a rational being in the world with
4919: whom everything goes according to his wish and will; it rests,
4920: therefore, on the harmony of physical nature with his whole end and
4921: likewise with the essential determining principle of his will. Now the
4922: moral law as a law of freedom commands by determining principles,
4923: which ought to be quite independent of nature and of its harmony
4924: with our faculty of desire (as springs). But the acting rational being
4925: in the world is not the cause of the world and of nature itself. There
4926: is not the least ground, therefore, in the moral law for a necessary
4927: connection between morality and proportionate happiness in a being
4928: that belongs to the world as part of it, and therefore dependent on
4929: it, and which for that reason cannot by his will be a cause of this
4930: nature, nor by his own power make it thoroughly harmonize, as far as
4931: his happiness is concerned, with his practical principles.
4932: Nevertheless, in the practical problem of pure reason, i.e., the
4933: necessary pursuit of the summum bonum, such a connection is postulated
4934: as necessary: we ought to endeavour to promote the summum bonum,
4935: which, therefore, must be possible. Accordingly, the existence of a
4936: cause of all nature, distinct from nature itself and containing the
4937: principle of this connection, namely, of the exact harmony of
4938: happiness with morality, is also postulated. Now this supreme cause
4939: must contain the principle of the harmony of nature, not merely with a
4940: law of the will of rational beings, but with the conception of this
4941: law, in so far as they make it the supreme determining principle of
4942: the will, and consequently not merely with the form of morals, but
4943: with their morality as their motive, that is, with their moral
4944: character. Therefore, the summum bonum is possible in the world only
4945: on the supposition of a Supreme Being having a causality corresponding
4946: to moral character. Now a being that is capable of acting on the
4947: conception of laws is an intelligence (a rational being), and the
4948: causality of such a being according to this conception of laws is
4949: his will; therefore the supreme cause of nature, which must be
4950: presupposed as a condition of the summum bonum is a being which is the
4951: cause of nature by intelligence and will, consequently its author,
4952: that is God. It follows that the postulate of the possibility of the
4953: highest derived good (the best world) is likewise the postulate of the
4954: reality of a highest original good, that is to say, of the existence
4955: of God. Now it was seen to be a duty for us to promote the summum
4956: bonum; consequently it is not merely allowable, but it is a
4957: necessity connected with duty as a requisite, that we should
4958: presuppose the possibility of this summum bonum; and as this is
4959: possible only on condition of the existence of God, it inseparably
4960: connects the supposition of this with duty; that is, it is morally
4961: necessary to assume the existence of God.
4962: 
4963: It must be remarked here that this moral necessity is subjective,
4964: that is, it is a want, and not objective, that is, itself a duty,
4965: for there cannot be a duty to suppose the existence of anything (since
4966: this concerns only the theoretical employment of reason). Moreover, it
4967: is not meant by this that it is necessary to suppose the existence
4968: of God as a basis of all obligation in general (for this rests, as has
4969: been sufficiently proved, simply on the autonomy of reason itself).
4970: What belongs to duty here is only the endeavour to realize and promote
4971: the summum bonum in the world, the possibility of which can
4972: therefore be postulated; and as our reason finds it not conceivable
4973: except on the supposition of a supreme intelligence, the admission
4974: of this existence is therefore connected with the consciousness of our
4975: duty, although the admission itself belongs to the domain of
4976: speculative reason. Considered in respect of this alone, as a
4977: principle of explanation, it may be called a hypothesis, but in
4978: reference to the intelligibility of an object given us by the moral
4979: law (the summum bonum), and consequently of a requirement for
4980: practical purposes, it may be called faith, that is to say a pure
4981: rational faith, since pure reason (both in its theoretical and
4982: practical use) is the sole source from which it springs.
4983: 
4984:                                           {BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 45}
4985: 
4986: From this deduction it is now intelligible why the Greek schools
4987: could never attain the solution of their problem of the practical
4988: possibility of the summum bonum, because they made the rule of the use
4989: which the will of man makes of his freedom the sole and sufficient
4990: ground of this possibility, thinking that they had no need for that
4991: purpose of the existence of God. No doubt they were so far right
4992: that they established the principle of morals of itself
4993: independently of this postulate, from the relation of reason only to
4994: the will, and consequently made it the supreme practical condition
4995: of the summum bonum; but it was not therefore the whole condition of
4996: its possibility. The Epicureans had indeed assumed as the supreme
4997: principle of morality a wholly false one, namely that of happiness,
4998: and had substituted for a law a maxim of arbitrary choice according to
4999: every man's inclination; they proceeded, however, consistently
5000: enough in this, that they degraded their summum bonum likewise, just
5001: in proportion to the meanness of their fundamental principle, and
5002: looked for no greater happiness than can be attained by human prudence
5003: (including temperance and moderation of the inclinations), and this as
5004: we know would be scanty enough and would be very different according
5005: to circumstances; not to mention the exceptions that their maxims must
5006: perpetually admit and which make them incapable of being laws. The
5007: Stoics, on the contrary, had chosen their supreme practical
5008: principle quite rightly, making virtue the condition of the summum
5009: bonum; but when they represented the degree of virtue required by
5010: its pure law as fully attainable in this life, they not only
5011: strained the moral powers of the man whom they called the wise
5012: beyond all the limits of his nature, and assumed a thing that
5013: contradicts all our knowledge of men, but also and principally they
5014: would not allow the second element of the summum bonum, namely,
5015: happiness, to be properly a special object of human desire, but made
5016: their wise man, like a divinity in his consciousness of the excellence
5017: of his person, wholly independent of nature (as regards his own
5018: contentment); they exposed him indeed to the evils of life, but made
5019: him not subject to them (at the same time representing him also as
5020: free from moral evil). They thus, in fact, left out the second element
5021: of the summum bonum namely, personal happiness, placing it solely in
5022: action and satisfaction with one's own personal worth, thus
5023: including it in the consciousness of being morally minded, in which
5024: they Might have been sufficiently refuted by the voice of their own
5025: nature.
5026: 
5027: The doctrine of Christianity, * even if we do not yet consider it
5028: as a religious doctrine, gives, touching this point, a conception of
5029: the summum bonum (the kingdom of God), which alone satisfies the
5030: strictest demand of practical reason. The moral law is holy
5031: (unyielding) and demands holiness of morals, although all the moral
5032: perfection to which man can attain is still only virtue, that is, a
5033: rightful disposition arising from respect for the law, implying
5034: consciousness of a constant propensity to transgression, or at least a
5035: want of purity, that is, a mixture of many spurious (not moral)
5036: motives of obedience to the law, consequently a self-esteem combined
5037: with humility. In respect, then, of the holiness which the Christian
5038: law requires, this leaves the creature nothing but a progress in
5039: infinitum, but for that very reason it justifies him in hoping for
5040: an endless duration of his existence. The worth of a character
5041: perfectly accordant with the moral law is infinite, since the only
5042: restriction on all possible happiness in the judgement of a wise and
5043: all powerful distributor of it is the absence of conformity of
5044: rational beings to their duty. But the moral law of itself does not
5045: promise any happiness, for according to our conceptions of an order of
5046: nature in general, this is not necessarily connected with obedience to
5047: the law. Now Christian morality supplies this defect (of the second
5048: indispensable element of the summum bonum) by representing the world
5049: in which rational beings devote themselves with all their soul to
5050: the moral law, as a kingdom of God, in which nature and morality are
5051: brought into a harmony foreign to each of itself, by a holy Author who
5052: makes the derived summum bonum possible. Holiness of life is
5053: prescribed to them as a rule even in this life, while the welfare
5054: proportioned to it, namely, bliss, is represented as attainable only
5055: in an eternity; because the former must always be the pattern of their
5056: conduct in every state, and progress towards it is already possible
5057: and necessary in this life; while the latter, under the name of
5058: happiness, cannot be attained at all in this world (so far as our
5059: own power is concerned), and therefore is made simply an object of
5060: hope. Nevertheless, the Christian principle of morality itself is
5061: not theological (so as to be heteronomy), but is autonomy of pure
5062: practical reason, since it does not make the knowledge of God and
5063: His will the foundation of these laws, but only of the attainment of
5064: the summum bonum, on condition of following these laws, and it does
5065: not even place the proper spring of this obedience in the desired
5066: results, but solely in the conception of duty, as that of which the
5067: faithful observance alone constitutes the worthiness to obtain those
5068: happy consequences.
5069: 
5070: 
5071: 
5072: * It is commonly held that the Christian precept of morality has no
5073: advantage in respect of purity over the moral conceptions of the
5074: Stoics; the distinction between them is, however, very obvious. The
5075: Stoic system made the consciousness of strength of mind the pivot on
5076: which all moral dispositions should turn; and although its disciples
5077: spoke of duties and even defined them very well, yet they placed the
5078: spring and proper determining principle of the will in an elevation of
5079: the mind above the lower springs of the senses, which owe their
5080: power only to weakness of mind. With them therefore, virtue was a sort
5081: of heroism in the wise man raising himself above the animal nature
5082: of man, is sufficient for Himself, and, while he prescribes duties
5083: to others, is himself raised above them, and is not subject to any
5084: temptation to transgress the moral law. All this, however, they
5085: could not have done if they had conceived this law in all its purity
5086: and strictness, as the precept of the Gospel does. When I give the
5087: name idea to a perfection to which nothing adequate can be given in
5088: experience, it does not follow that the moral ideas are thing
5089: transcendent, that is something of which we could not even determine
5090: the concept adequately, or of which it is uncertain whether there is
5091: any object corresponding to it at all, as is the case with the ideas
5092: of speculative reason; on the contrary, being types of practical
5093: perfection, they serve as the indispensable rule of conduct and
5094: likewise as the standard of comparison. Now if I consider Christian
5095: morals on their philosophical side, then compared with the ideas of
5096: the Greek schools, they would appear as follows: the ideas of the
5097: Cynics, the Epicureans, the Stoics, and the Christians are: simplicity
5098: of nature, prudence, wisdom, and holiness. In respect of the way of
5099: attaining them, the Greek schools were distinguished from one
5100: another thus that the Cynics only required common sense, the others
5101: the path of science, but both found the mere use of natural powers
5102: sufficient for the purpose. Christian morality, because its precept is
5103: framed (as a moral precept must be) so pure and unyielding, takes from
5104: man all confidence that he can be fully adequate to it, at least in
5105: this life, but again sets it up by enabling us to hope that if we
5106: act as well as it is in our power to do, then what is not in our power
5107: will come in to our aid from another source, whether we know how
5108: this may be or not. Aristotle and Plato differed only as to the origin
5109: of our moral conceptions.

5114: 
5115: In this manner, the moral laws lead through the conception of the
5116: summum bonum as the object and final end of pure practical reason to
5117: religion, that is, to the recognition of all duties as divine
5118: commands, not as sanctions, that is to say, arbitrary ordinances of
5119: a foreign and contingent in themselves, but as essential laws of every
5120: free will in itself, which, nevertheless, must be regarded as commands
5121: of the Supreme Being, because it is only from a morally perfect
5122: (holy and good) and at the same time all-powerful will, and
5123: consequently only through harmony with this will, that we can hope
5124: to attain the summum bonum which the moral law makes it our duty to
5125: take as the object of our endeavours. Here again, then, all remains
5126: disinterested and founded merely on duty; neither fear nor hope
5127: being made the fundamental springs, which if taken as principles would
5128: destroy the whole moral worth of actions. The moral law commands me to
5129: make the highest possible good in a world the ultimate object of all
5130: my conduct. But I cannot hope to effect this otherwise than by the
5131: harmony of my will with that of a holy and good Author of the world;
5132: and although the conception of the summum bonum as a whole, in which
5133: the greatest happiness is conceived as combined in the most exact
5134: proportion with the highest degree of moral perfection (possible in
5135: creatures), includes my own happiness, yet it is not this that is
5136: the determining principle of the will which is enjoined to promote the
5137: summum bonum, but the moral law, which, on the contrary, limits by
5138: strict conditions my unbounded desire of happiness.
5139: 
5140: Hence also morality is not properly the doctrine how we should
5141: make ourselves happy, but how we should become worthy of happiness. It
5142: is only when religion is added that there also comes in the hope of
5143: participating some day in happiness in proportion as we have
5144: endeavoured to be not unworthy of it.
5145: 
5146: A man is worthy to possess a thing or a state when his possession of
5147: it is in harmony with the summum bonum. We can now easily see that all
5148: worthiness depends on moral conduct, since in the conception of the
5149: summum bonum this constitutes the condition of the rest (which belongs
5150: to one's state), namely, the participation of happiness. Now it
5151: follows from this that morality should never be treated as a
5152: doctrine of happiness, that is, an instruction how to become happy;
5153: for it has to do simply with the rational condition (conditio sine qua
5154: non) of happiness, not with the means of attaining it. But when
5155: morality has been completely expounded (which merely imposes duties
5156: instead of providing rules for selfish desires), then first, after the
5157: moral desire to promote the summum bonum (to bring the kingdom of
5158: God to us) has been awakened, a desire founded on a law, and which
5159: could not previously arise in any selfish mind, and when for the
5160: behoof of this desire the step to religion has been taken, then this
5161: ethical doctrine may be also called a doctrine of happiness because
5162: the hope of happiness first begins with religion only.
5163: 
5164: We can also see from this that, when we ask what is God's ultimate
5165: end in creating the world, we must not name the happiness of the
5166: rational beings in it, but the summum bonum, which adds a further
5167: condition to that wish of such beings, namely, the condition of
5168: being worthy of happiness, that is, the morality of these same
5169: rational beings, a condition which alone contains the rule by which
5170: only they can hope to share in the former at the hand of a wise
5171: Author. For as wisdom, theoretically considered, signifies the
5172: knowledge of the summum bonum and, practically, the accordance of
5173: the will with the summum bonum, we cannot attribute to a supreme
5174: independent wisdom an end based merely on goodness. For we cannot
5175: conceive the action of this goodness (in respect of the happiness of
5176: rational beings) as suitable to the highest original good, except
5177: under the restrictive conditions of harmony with the holiness * of
5178: his will. Therefore, those who placed the end of creation in the glory
5179: of God (provided that this is not conceived anthropomorphically as a
5180: desire to be praised) have perhaps hit upon the best expression. For
5181: nothing glorifies God more than that which is the most estimable thing
5182: in the world, respect for his command, the observance of the holy duty
5183: that his law imposes on us, when there is added thereto his glorious
5184: plan of crowning such a beautiful order of things with corresponding
5185: happiness. If the latter (to speak humanly) makes Him worthy of
5186: love, by the former He is an object of adoration. Even men can never
5187: acquire respect by benevolence alone, though they may gain love, so
5188: that the greatest beneficence only procures them honour when it is
5189: regulated by worthiness.

5194: 
5195: * In order to make these characteristics of these conceptions
5196: clear, I add the remark that whilst we ascribe to God various
5197: attributes, the quality of which we also find applicable to creatures,
5198: only that in Him they are raised to the highest degree, e.g., power,
5199: knowledge, presence, goodness, etc., under the designations of
5200: omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, etc., there are three that are
5201: ascribed to God exclusively, and yet without the addition of
5202: greatness, and which are all moral He is the only holy, the only
5203: blessed, the only wise, because these conceptions already imply the
5204: absence of limitation. In the order of these attributes He is also the
5205: holy lawgiver (and creator), the good governor (and preserver) and the
5206: just judge, three attributes which include everything by which God
5207: is the object of religion, and in conformity with which the
5208: metaphysical perfections are added of themselves in the reason.
5209: 
5210: 
5211: 
5212: That in the order of ends, man (and with him every rational being)
5213: is an end in himself, that is, that he can never be used merely as a
5214: means by any (not even by God) without being at the same time an end
5215: also himself, that therefore humanity in our person must be holy to
5216: ourselves, this follows now of itself because he is the subject of the
5217: moral law, in other words, of that which is holy in itself, and on
5218: account of which and in agreement with which alone can anything be
5219: termed holy. For this moral law is founded on the autonomy of his
5220: will, as a free will which by its universal laws must necessarily be
5221: able to agree with that to which it is to submit itself.

5225:   VI. Of the Postulates of Pure Practical Reason Generally.

5227:                                           {BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 60}
5228: 
5229: 
5230: 
5231: They all proceed from the principle of morality, which is not a
5232: postulate but a law, by which reason determines the will directly,
5233: which will, because it is so determined as a pure will, requires these
5234: necessary conditions of obedience to its precept. These postulates are
5235: not theoretical dogmas but, suppositions practically necessary;
5236: while then they do [not] extend our speculative knowledge, they give
5237: objective reality to the ideas of speculative reason in general (by
5238: means of their reference to what is practical), and give it a right to
5239: concepts, the possibility even of which it could not otherwise venture
5240: to affirm.
5241: 
5242: These postulates are those of immortality, freedom positively
5243: considered (as the causality of a being so far as he belongs to the
5244: intelligible world), and the existence of God. The first results
5245: from the practically necessary condition of a duration adequate to the
5246: complete fulfilment of the moral law; the second from the necessary
5247: supposition of independence of the sensible world, and of the
5248: faculty of determining one's will according to the law of an
5249: intelligible world, that is, of freedom; the third from the
5250: necessary condition of the existence of the summum bonum in such an
5251: intelligible world, by the supposition of the supreme independent
5252: good, that is, the existence of God.
5253: 
5254: Thus the fact that respect for the moral law necessarily makes the
5255: summum bonum an object of our endeavours, and the supposition thence
5256: resulting of its objective reality, lead through the postulates of
5257: practical reason to conceptions which speculative reason might
5258: indeed present as problems, but could never solve. Thus it leads: 1.
5259: To that one in the solution of which the latter could do nothing but
5260: commit paralogisms (namely, that of immortality), because it could not
5261: lay hold of the character of permanence, by which to complete the
5262: psychological conception of an ultimate subject necessarily ascribed
5263: to the soul in self-consciousness, so as to make it the real
5264: conception of a substance, a character which practical reason
5265: furnishes by the postulate of a duration required for accordance
5266: with the moral law in the summum bonum, which is the whole end of
5267: practical reason. 2. It leads to that of which speculative reason
5268: contained nothing but antinomy, the solution of which it could only
5269: found on a notion problematically conceivable indeed, but whose
5270: objective reality it could not prove or determine, namely, the
5271: cosmological idea of an intelligible world and the consciousness of
5272: our existence in it, by means of the postulate of freedom (the reality
5273: of which it lays down by virtue of the moral law), and with it
5274: likewise the law of an intelligible world, to which speculative reason
5275: could only point, but could not define its conception. 3. What
5276: speculative reason was able to think, but was obliged to leave
5277: undetermined as a mere transcendental ideal, viz., the theological
5278: conception of the first Being, to this it gives significance (in a
5279: practical view, that is, as a condition of the possibility of the
5280: object of a will determined by that law), namely, as the supreme
5281: principle of the summum bonum in an intelligible world, by means of
5282: moral legislation in it invested with sovereign power.
5283: 
5284: Is our knowledge, however, actually extended in this way by pure
5285: practical reason, and is that immanent in practical reason which for
5286: the speculative was only transcendent? Certainly, but only in a
5287: practical point of view. For we do not thereby take knowledge of the
5288: nature of our souls, nor of the intelligible world, nor of the Supreme
5289: Being, with respect to what they are in themselves, but we have merely
5290: combined the conceptions of them in the practical concept of the
5291: summum bonum as the object of our will, and this altogether a
5292: priori, but only by means of the moral law, and merely in reference to
5293: it, in respect of the object which it commands. But how freedom is
5294: possible, and how we are to conceive this kind of causality
5295: theoretically and positively, is not thereby discovered; but only that
5296: there is such a causality is postulated by the moral law and in its
5297: behoof. It is the same with the remaining ideas, the possibility of
5298: which no human intelligence will ever fathom, but the truth of
5299: which, on the other hand, no sophistry will ever wrest from the
5300: conviction even of the commonest man.

5310:         Knowledge as Speculative being enlarged at

5315: 
5316: 
5317: 
5318: In order not to be too abstract, we will answer this question at
5319: once in its application to the present case. In order to extend a pure
5320: cognition practically, there must be an a priori purpose given, that
5321: is, an end as object (of the will), which independently of all
5322: theological principle is presented as practically necessary by an
5323: imperative which determines the will directly (a categorical
5324: imperative), and in this case that is the summum bonum. This, however,
5325: is not possible without presupposing three theoretical conceptions
5326: (for which, because they are mere conceptions of pure reason, no
5327: corresponding intuition can be found, nor consequently by the path
5328: of theory any objective reality); namely, freedom, immortality, and
5329: God. Thus by the practical law which commands the existence of the
5330: highest good possible in a world, the possibility of those objects
5331: of pure speculative reason is postulated, and the objective reality
5332: which the latter could not assure them. By this the theoretical
5333: knowledge of pure reason does indeed obtain an accession; but it
5334: consists only in this, that those concepts which otherwise it had to
5335: look upon as problematical (merely thinkable) concepts, are now
5336: shown assertorially to be such as actually have objects; because
5337: practical reason indispensably requires their existence for the
5338: possibility of its object, the summum bonum, which practically is
5339: absolutely necessary, and this justifies theoretical reason in
5340: assuming them. But this extension of theoretical reason is no
5341: extension of speculative, that is, we cannot make any positive use
5342: of it in a theoretical point of view. For as nothing is accomplished
5343: in this by practical reason, further than that these concepts are real
5344: and actually have their (possible) objects, and nothing in the way
5345: of intuition of them is given thereby (which indeed could not be
5346: demanded), hence the admission of this reality does not render any
5347: synthetical proposition possible. Consequently, this discovery does
5348: not in the least help us to extend this knowledge of ours in a
5349: speculative point of view, although it does in respect of the
5350: practical employment of pure reason. The above three ideas of
5351: speculative reason are still in themselves not cognitions; they are
5352: however (transcendent) thoughts, in which there is nothing impossible.
5353: Now, by help of an apodeictic practical law, being necessary
5354: conditions of that which it commands to be made an object, they
5355: acquire objective reality; that is, we learn from it that they have
5356: objects, without being able to point out how the conception of them is
5357: related to an object, and this, too, is still not a cognition of these
5358: objects; for we cannot thereby form any synthetical judgement about
5359: them, nor determine their application theoretically; consequently,
5360: we can make no theoretical rational use of them at all, in which use
5361: all speculative knowledge of reason consists. Nevertheless, the
5362: theoretical knowledge, not indeed of these objects, but of reason
5363: generally, is so far enlarged by this, that by the practical
5364: postulates objects were given to those ideas, a merely problematical
5365: thought having by this means first acquired objective reality. There
5366: is therefore no extension of the knowledge of given supersensible
5367: objects, but an extension of theoretical reason and of its knowledge
5368: in respect of the supersensible generally; inasmuch as it is compelled
5369: to admit that there are such objects, although it is not able to
5370: define them more closely, so as itself to extend this knowledge of the
5371: objects (which have now been given it on practical grounds, and only
5372: for practical use). For this accession, then, pure theoretical reason,
5373: for which all those ideas are transcendent and without object, has
5374: simply to thank its practical faculty. In this they become immanent
5375: and constitutive, being the source of the possibility of realizing the
5376: necessary object of pure practical reason (the summum bonum);
5377: whereas apart from this they are transcendent, and merely regulative
5378: principles of speculative reason, which do not require it to assume
5379: a new object beyond experience, but only to bring its use in
5380: experience nearer to completeness. But when once reason is in
5381: possession of this accession, it will go to work with these ideas as
5382: speculative reason (properly only to assure the certainty of its
5383: practical use) in a negative manner: that is, not extending but
5384: clearing up its knowledge so as on one side to keep off
5385: anthropomorphism, as the source of superstition, or seeming
5386: extension of these conceptions by supposed experience; and on the
5387: other side fanaticism, which promises the same by means of
5388: supersensible intuition or feelings of the like kind. All these are
5389: hindrances to the practical use of pure reason, so that the removal of
5390: them may certainly be considered an extension of our knowledge in a
5391: practical point of view, without contradicting the admission that
5392: for speculative purposes reason has not in the least gained by this.
5393: 
5394: Every employment of reason in respect of an object requires pure
5395: concepts of the understanding (categories), without which no object
5396: can be conceived. These can be applied to the theoretical employment
5397: of reason, i.e., to that kind of knowledge, only in case an
5398: intuition (which is always sensible) is taken as a basis, and
5399: therefore merely in order to conceive by means of- them an object of
5400: possible experience. Now here what have to be thought by means of
5401: the categories in order to be known are ideas of reason, which
5402: cannot be given in any experience. Only we are not here concerned with
5403: the theoretical knowledge of the objects of these ideas, but only with
5404: this, whether they have objects at all. This reality is supplied by
5405: pure practical reason, and theoretical reason has nothing further to
5406: do in this but to think those objects by means of categories. This, as
5407: we have elsewhere clearly shown, can be done well enough without
5408: needing any intuition (either sensible or supersensible) because the
5409: categories have their seat and origin in the pure understanding,
5410: simply as the faculty of thought, before and independently of any
5411: intuition, and they always only signify an object in general, no
5412: matter in what way it may be given to us. Now when the categories
5413: are to be applied to these ideas, it is not possible to give them
5414: any object in intuition; but that such an object actually exists,
5415: and consequently that the category as a mere form of thought is here
5416: not empty but has significance, this is sufficiently assured them by
5417: an object which practical reason presents beyond doubt in the
5418: concept of the summum bonum, the reality of the conceptions which
5419: are required for the possibility of the summum bonum; without,
5420: however, effecting by this accession the least extension of our
5421: knowledge on theoretical principles.
5422: 
5423: 
5424: 
5425: When these ideas of God, of an intelligible world (the kingdom of
5426: God), and of immortality are further determined by predicates taken
5427: from our own nature, we must not regard this determination as a
5428: sensualizing of those pure rational ideas (anthropomorphism), nor as a
5429: transcendent knowledge of supersensible objects; for these
5430: predicates are no others than understanding and will, considered too
5431: in the relation to each other in which they must be conceived in the
5432: moral law, and therefore, only so far as a pure practical use is
5433: made of them. As to all the rest that belongs to these conceptions
5434: psychologically, that is, so far as we observe these faculties of ours
5435: empirically in their exercise (e.g., that the understanding of man
5436: is discursive, and its notions therefore not intuitions but
5437: thoughts, that these follow one another in time, that his will has its
5438: satisfaction always dependent on the existence of its object, etc.,
5439: which cannot be the case in the Supreme Being), from all this we
5440: abstract in that case, and then there remains of the notions by
5441: which we conceive a pure intelligence nothing more than just what is
5442: required for the possibility of conceiving a moral law. There is
5443: then a knowledge of God indeed, but only for practical purposes,
5444: and, if we attempt to extend it to a theoretical knowledge, we find an
5445: understanding that has intuitions, not thoughts, a will that is
5446: directed to objects on the existence of which its satisfaction does
5447: not in the least depend (not to mention the transcendental predicates,
5448: as, for example, a magnitude of existence, that is duration, which,
5449: however, is not in time, the only possible means we have of conceiving
5450: existence as magnitude). Now these are all attributes of which we
5451: can form no conception that would help to the knowledge of the object,
5452: and we learn from this that they can never be used for a theory of
5453: supersensible beings, so that on this side they are quite incapable of
5454: being the foundation of a speculative knowledge, and their use is
5455: limited simply to the practice of the moral law.

5457:                                           {BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 75}
5458: 
5459: This last is so obvious, and can be proved so clearly by fact,
5460: that we may confidently challenge all pretended natural theologians (a
5461: singular name) * to specify (over and above the merely ontological
5462: predicates) one single attribute, whether of the understanding or of
5463: the will, determining this object of theirs, of which we could not
5464: show incontrovertibly that, if we abstract from it everything
5465: anthropomorphic, nothing would remain to us but the mere word, without
5466: our being able to connect with it the smallest notion by which we
5467: could hope for an extension of theoretical knowledge. But as to the
5468: practical, there still remains to us of the attributes of
5469: understanding and will the conception of a relation to which objective
5470: reality is given by the practical law (which determines a priori
5471: precisely this relation of the understanding to the will). When once
5472: this is done, then reality is given to the conception of the object of
5473: a will morally determined (the conception of the summum bonum), and
5474: with it to the conditions of its possibility, the ideas of God,
5475: freedom, and immortality, but always only relatively to the practice
5476: of the moral law (and not for any speculative purpose).

5480: * Learning is properly only the whole content of the historical
5481: sciences. Consequently it is only the teacher of revealed theology
5482: that can be called a learned theologian. If, however, we choose to
5483: call a man learned who is in possession of the rational sciences
5484: (mathematics and philosophy), although even this would be contrary
5485: to the signification of the word (which always counts as learning only
5486: that which one must be "learned" and which, therefore, he cannot
5487: discover of himself by reason), even in that case the philosopher
5488: would make too poor a figure with his knowledge of God as a positive
5489: science to let himself be called on that account a learned man.
5490: 
5491: 
5492: 
5493: According to these remarks it is now easy to find the answer to
5494: the weighty question whether the notion of God is one belonging to
5495: physics (and therefore also to metaphysics, which contains the pure
5496: a priori principles of the former in their universal import) or to
5497: morals. If we have recourse to God as the Author of all things, in
5498: order to explain the arrangements of nature or its changes, this is at
5499: least not a physical explanation, and is a complete confession that
5500: our philosophy has come to an end, since we are obliged to assume
5501: something of which in itself we have otherwise no conception, in order
5502: to be able to frame a conception of the possibility of what we see
5503: before our eyes. Metaphysics, however, cannot enable us to attain by
5504: certain inference from the knowledge of this world to the conception
5505: of God and to the proof of His existence, for this reason, that in
5506: order to say that this world could be produced only by a God
5507: (according to the conception implied by this word) we should know this
5508: world as the most perfect whole possible; and for this purpose
5509: should also know all possible worlds (in order to be able to compare
5510: them with this); in other words, we should be omniscient. It is
5511: absolutely impossible, however, to know the existence of this Being
5512: from mere concepts, because every existential proposition, that is,
5513: every proposition that affirms the existence of a being of which I
5514: frame a concept, is a synthetic proposition, that is, one by which I
5515: go beyond that conception and affirm of it more than was thought in
5516: the conception itself; namely, that this concept in the
5517: understanding has an object corresponding to it outside the
5518: understanding, and this it is obviously impossible to elicit by any
5519: reasoning. There remains, therefore, only one single process
5520: possible for reason to attain this knowledge, namely, to start from
5521: the supreme principle of its pure practical use (which in every case
5522: is directed simply to the existence of something as a consequence of
5523: reason) and thus determine its object. Then its inevitable problem,
5524: namely, the necessary direction of the will to the summum bonum,
5525: discovers to us not only the necessity of assuming such a First
5526: Being in reference to the possibility of this good in the world,
5527: but, what is most remarkable, something which reason in its progress
5528: on the path of physical nature altogether failed to find, namely, an
5529: accurately defined conception of this First Being. As we can know only
5530: a small part of this world, and can still less compare it with all
5531: possible worlds, we may indeed from its order, design, and
5532: greatness, infer a wise, good, powerful, etc., Author of it, but not
5533: that He is all-wise, all-good, all-powerful, etc. It may indeed very
5534: well be granted that we should be justified in supplying this
5535: inevitable defect by a legitimate and reasonable hypothesis; namely,
5536: that when wisdom, goodness, etc, are displayed in all the parts that
5537: offer themselves to our nearer knowledge, it is just the same in all
5538: the rest, and that it would therefore be reasonable to ascribe all
5539: possible perfections to the Author of the world, but these are not
5540: strict logical inferences in which we can pride ourselves on our
5541: insight, but only permitted conclusions in which we may be indulged
5542: and which require further recommendation before we can make use of
5543: them. On the path of empirical inquiry then (physics), the
5544: conception of God remains always a conception of the perfection of the
5545: First Being not accurately enough determined to be held adequate to
5546: the conception of Deity. (With metaphysic in its transcendental part
5547: nothing whatever can be accomplished.)

5550: 
5551: When I now try to test this conception by reference to the object of
5552: practical reason, I find that the moral principle admits as possible
5553: only the conception of an Author of the world possessed of the highest
5554: perfection. He must be omniscient, in order to know my conduct up to
5555: the inmost root of my mental state in all possible cases and into
5556: all future time; omnipotent, in order to allot to it its fitting
5557: consequences; similarly He must be omnipresent, eternal, etc. Thus the
5558: moral law, by means of the conception of the summum bonum as the
5559: object of a pure practical reason, determines the concept of the First
5560: Being as the Supreme Being; a thing which the physical (and in its
5561: higher development the metaphysical), in other words, the whole
5562: speculative course of reason, was unable to effect. The conception
5563: of God, then, is one that belongs originally not to physics, i.e.,
5564: to speculative reason, but to morals. The same may be said of the
5565: other conceptions of reason of which we have treated above as
5566: postulates of it in its practical use.
5567: 
5568: In the history of Grecian philosophy we find no distinct traces of a
5569: pure rational theology earlier than Anaxagoras; but this is not
5570: because the older philosophers had not intelligence or penetration
5571: enough to raise themselves to it by the path of speculation, at
5572: least with the aid of a thoroughly reasonable hypothesis. What could
5573: have been easier, what more natural, than the thought which of
5574: itself occurs to everyone, to assume instead of several causes of
5575: the world, instead of an indeterminate degree of perfection, a
5576: single rational cause having all perfection? But the evils in the
5577: world seemed to them to be much too serious objections to allow them
5578: to feel themselves justified in such a hypothesis. They showed
5579: intelligence and penetration then in this very point, that they did
5580: not allow themselves to adopt it, but on the contrary looked about
5581: amongst natural causes to see if they could not find in them the
5582: qualities and power required for a First Being. But when this acute
5583: people had advanced so far in their investigations of nature as to
5584: treat even moral questions philosophically, on which other nations had
5585: never done anything but talk, then first they found a new and
5586: practical want, which did not fail to give definiteness to their
5587: conception of the First Being: and in this the speculative reason
5588: played the part of spectator, or at best had the merit of embellishing
5589: a conception that had not grown on its own ground, and of applying a
5590: series of confirmations from the study of nature now brought forward
5591: for the first time, not indeed to strengthen the authority of this
5592: conception (which was already established), but rather to make a
5593: show with a supposed discovery of theoretical reason.
5594: 
5595: 
5596: 
5597: From these remarks, the reader of the Critique of Pure Speculative
5598: Reason will be thoroughly convinced how highly necessary that
5599: laborious deduction of the categories was, and how fruitful for
5600: theology and morals. For if, on the one hand, we place them in pure
5601: understanding, it is by this deduction alone that we can be
5602: prevented from regarding them, with Plato, as innate, and founding
5603: on them extravagant pretensions to theories of the supersensible, to
5604: which we can see no end, and by which we should make theology a
5605: magic lantern of chimeras; on the other hand, if we regard them as
5606: acquired, this deduction saves us from restricting, with Epicurus, all
5607: and every use of them, even for practical purposes, to the objects and
5608: motives of the senses. But now that the Critique has shown by that
5609: deduction, first, that they are not of empirical origin, but have
5610: their seat and source a priori in the pure understanding; secondly,
5611: that as they refer to objects in general independently of the
5612: intuition of them, hence, although they cannot effect theoretical
5613: knowledge, except in application to empirical objects, yet when
5614: applied to an object given by pure practical reason they enable us
5615: to conceive the supersensible definitely, only so far, however, as
5616: it is defined by such predicates as are necessarily connected with the
5617: pure practical purpose given a priori and with its possibility. The
5618: speculative restriction of pure reason and its practical extension
5619: bring it into that relation of equality in which reason in general can
5620: be employed suitably to its end, and this example proves better than
5621: any other that the path to wisdom, if it is to be made sure and not to
5622: be impassable or misleading, must with us men inevitably pass
5623: through science; but it is not till this is complete that we can be
5624: convinced that it leads to this goal.

5630:     VIII. Of Belief from a Requirement of Pure Reason.
5631: 
5632: 
5633: 
5634: A want or requirement of pure reason in its speculative use leads
5635: only to a hypothesis; that of pure practical reason to a postulate;
5636: for in the former case I ascend from the result as high as I please in
5637: the series of causes, not in order to give objective reality to the
5638: result (e.g., the causal connection of things and changes in the
5639: world), but in order thoroughly to satisfy my inquiring reason in
5640: respect of it. Thus I see before me order and design in nature, and
5641: need not resort to speculation to assure myself of their reality,
5642: but to explain them I have to presuppose a Deity as their cause; and
5643: then since the inference from an effect to a definite cause is
5644: always uncertain and doubtful, especially to a cause so precise and so
5645: perfectly defined as we have to conceive in God, hence the highest
5646: degree of certainty to which this pre-supposition can be brought is
5647: that it is the most rational opinion for us men. * On the other hand,
5648: a requirement of pure practical reason is based on a duty, that of
5649: making something (the summum bonum) the object of my will so as to
5650: promote it with all my powers; in which case I must suppose its
5651: possibility and, consequently, also the conditions necessary
5652: thereto, namely, God, freedom, and immortality; since I cannot prove
5653: these by my speculative reason, although neither can I refute them.
5654: This duty is founded on something that is indeed quite independent
5655: of these suppositions and is of itself apodeictically certain, namely,
5656: the moral law; and so far it needs no further support by theoretical
5657: views as to the inner constitution of things, the secret final aim
5658: of the order of the world, or a presiding ruler thereof, in order to
5659: bind me in the most perfect manner to act in unconditional
5660: conformity to the law. But the subjective effect of this law,
5661: namely, the mental disposition conformed to it and made necessary by
5662: it, to promote the practically possible summum bonum, this
5663: pre-supposes at least that the latter is possible, for it would be
5664: practically impossible to strive after the object of a conception
5665: which at bottom was empty and had no object. Now the above-mentioned
5666: postulates concern only the physical or metaphysical conditions of the
5667: possibility of the summum bonum; in a word, those which lie in the
5668: nature of things; not, however, for the sake of an arbitrary
5669: speculative purpose, but of a practically necessary end of a pure
5670: rational will, which in this case does not choose, but obeys an
5671: inexorable command of reason, the foundation of which is objective, in
5672: the constitution of things as they must be universally judged by
5673: pure reason, and is not based on inclination; for we are in nowise
5674: justified in assuming, on account of what we wish on merely subjective
5675: grounds, that the means thereto are possible or that its object is
5676: real. This, then, is an absolutely necessary requirement, and what
5677: it pre-supposes is not merely justified as an allowable hypothesis,
5678: but as a postulate in a practical point of view; and admitting that
5679: the pure moral law inexorably binds every man as a command (not as a
5680: rule of prudence), the righteous man may say: "I will that there be
5681: a God, that my existence in this world be also an existence outside
5682: the chain of physical causes and in a pure world of the understanding,
5683: and lastly, that my duration be endless; I firmly abide by this, and
5684: will not let this faith be taken from me; for in this instance alone
5685: my interest, because I must not relax anything of it, inevitably
5686: determines my judgement, without regarding sophistries, however unable
5687: I may be to answer them or to oppose them with others more
5688: plausible. *(2)
5689: 
5690: 
5691: 
5692: * But even here we should not be able to allege a requirement of
5693: reason, if we had not before our eyes a problematical, but yet
5694: inevitable, conception of reason, namely, that of an absolutely
5695: necessary being. This conception now seeks to be defined, and this, in
5696: addition to the tendency to extend itself, is the objective ground
5697: of a requirement of speculative reason, namely, to have a more precise
5698: definition of the conception of a necessary being which is to serve as
5699: the first cause of other beings, so as to make these latter knowable
5700: by some means. Without such antecedent necessary problems there are no
5701: requirements- at least not of pure reason- the rest are requirements
5702: of inclination.

5704:                                           {BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 90}
5705: 
5706: *(2) In the Deutsches Museum, February, 1787, there is a
5707: dissertation by a very subtle and clear-headed man, the late
5708: Wizenmann, whose early death is to be lamented, in which he disputes
5709: the right to argue from a want to the objective reality of its object,
5710: and illustrates the point by the example of a man in love, who
5711: having fooled himself into an idea of beauty, which is merely a
5712: chimera of his own brain, would fain conclude that such an object
5713: really exists somewhere. I quite agree with him in this, in all
5714: cases where the want is founded on inclination, which cannot
5715: necessarily postulate the existence of its object even for the man
5716: that is affected by it, much less can it contain a demand valid for
5717: everyone, and therefore it is merely a subjective ground of the
5718: wish. But in the present case we have a want of reason springing
5719: from an objective determining principle of the will, namely, the moral
5720: law, which necessarily binds every rational being, and therefore
5721: justifies him in assuming a priori in nature the conditions proper for
5722: it, and makes the latter inseparable from the complete practical use
5723: of reason. It is a duty to realize the summum bonum to the utmost of
5724: our power, therefore it must be possible, consequently it is
5725: unavoidable for every rational being in the world to assume what is
5726: necessary for its objective possibility. The assumption is as
5727: necessary as the moral law, in connection with which alone it is
5728: valid.
5729: 
5730: 
5731: 
5732: In order to prevent misconception in the use of a notion as yet so
5733: unusual as that of a faith of pure practical reason, let me be
5734: permitted to add one more remark. It might almost seem as if this
5735: rational faith were here announced as itself a command, namely, that
5736: we should assume the summum bonum as possible. But a faith that is
5737: commanded is nonsense. Let the preceding analysis, however, be
5738: remembered of what is required to be supposed in the conception of the
5739: summum bonum, and it will be seen that it cannot be commanded to
5740: assume this possibility, and no practical disposition of mind is
5741: required to admit it; but that speculative reason must concede it
5742: without being asked, for no one can affirm that it is impossible in
5743: itself that rational beings in the world should at the same time be
5744: worthy of happiness in conformity with the moral law and also
5745: possess this happiness proportionately. Now in respect of the first
5746: element of the summum bonum, namely, that which concerns morality, the
5747: moral law gives merely a command, and to doubt the possibility of that
5748: element would be the same as to call in question the moral law itself.
5749: But as regards the second element of that object, namely, happiness
5750: perfectly proportioned to that worthiness, it is true that there is no
5751: need of a command to admit its possibility in general, for theoretical
5752: reason has nothing to say against it; but the manner in which we
5753: have to conceive this harmony of the laws of nature with those of
5754: freedom has in it something in respect of which we have a choice,
5755: because theoretical reason decides nothing with apodeictic certainty
5756: about it, and in respect of this there may be a moral interest which
5757: turns the scale.
5758: 
5759: I had said above that in a mere course of nature in the world an
5760: accurate correspondence between happiness and moral worth is not to be
5761: expected and must be regarded as impossible, and that therefore the
5762: possibility of the summum bonum cannot be admitted from this side
5763: except on the supposition of a moral Author of the world. I
5764: purposely reserved the restriction of this judgement to the subjective
5765: conditions of our reason, in order not to make use of it until the
5766: manner of this belief should be defined more precisely. The fact is
5767: that the impossibility referred to is merely subjective, that is,
5768: our reason finds it impossible for it to render conceivable in the way
5769: of a mere course of nature a connection so exactly proportioned and so
5770: thoroughly adapted to an end, between two sets of events happening
5771: according to such distinct laws; although, as with everything else
5772: in nature that is adapted to an end, it cannot prove, that is, show by
5773: sufficient objective reason, that it is not possible by universal laws
5774: of nature.
5775: 
5776: Now, however, a deciding principle of a different kind comes into
5777: play to turn the scale in this uncertainty of speculative reason.
5778: The command to promote the summum bonum is established on an objective
5779: basis (in practical reason); the possibility of the same in general is
5780: likewise established on an objective basis (in theoretical reason,
5781: which has nothing to say against it). But reason cannot decide
5782: objectively in what way we are to conceive this possibility; whether
5783: by universal laws of nature without a wise Author presiding over
5784: nature, or only on supposition of such an Author. Now here there comes
5785: in a subjective condition of reason, the only way theoretically
5786: possible for it, of conceiving the exact harmony of the kingdom of
5787: nature with the kingdom of morals, which is the condition of the
5788: possibility of the summum bonum; and at the same time the only one
5789: conducive to morality (which depends on an objective law of reason).
5790: Now since the promotion of this summum bonum, and therefore the
5791: supposition of its possibility, are objectively necessary (though only
5792: as a result of practical reason), while at the same time the manner in
5793: which we would conceive it rests with our own choice, and in this
5794: choice a free interest of pure practical reason decides for the
5795: assumption of a wise Author of the world; it is clear that the
5796: principle that herein determines our judgement, though as a want it is
5797: subjective, yet at the same time being the means of promoting what
5798: is objectively (practically) necessary, is the foundation of a maxim
5799: of belief in a moral point of view, that is, a faith of pure practical
5800: reason. This, then, is not commanded, but being a voluntary
5801: determination of our judgement, conducive to the moral (commanded)
5802: purpose, and moreover harmonizing with the theoretical requirement
5803: of reason, to assume that existence and to make it the foundation of
5804: our further employment of reason, it has itself sprung from the
5805: moral disposition of mind; it may therefore at times waver even in the
5806: well-disposed, but can never be reduced to unbelief.

5815: 
5816: 
5817: 
5818: If human nature is destined to endeavour after the summum bonum,
5819: we must suppose also that the measure of its cognitive faculties,
5820: and particularly their relation to one another, is suitable to this
5821: end. Now the Critique of Pure Speculative Reason proves that this is
5822: incapable of solving satisfactorily the most weighty problems that are
5823: proposed to it, although it does not ignore the natural and
5824: important hints received from the same reason, nor the great steps
5825: that it can make to approach to this great goal that is set before it,
5826: which, however, it can never reach of itself, even with the help of
5827: the greatest knowledge of nature. Nature then seems here to have
5828: provided us only in a step-motherly fashion with the faculty required
5829: for our end.

5832: 
5833: Suppose, now, that in this matter nature had conformed to our wish
5834: and had given us that capacity of discernment or that enlightenment
5835: which we would gladly possess, or which some imagine they actually
5836: possess, what would in all probability be the consequence? Unless
5837: our whole nature were at the same time changed, our inclinations,
5838: which always have the first word, would first of all demand their
5839: own satisfaction, and, joined with rational reflection, the greatest
5840: possible and most lasting satisfaction, under the name of happiness;
5841: the moral law would afterwards speak, in order to keep them within
5842: their proper bounds, and even to subject them all to a higher end,
5843: which has no regard to inclination. But instead of the conflict that
5844: the moral disposition has now to carry on with the inclinations, in
5845: which, though after some defeats, moral strength of mind may be
5846: gradually acquired, God and eternity with their awful majesty would
5847: stand unceasingly before our eyes (for what we can prove perfectly
5848: is to us as certain as that of which we are assured by the sight of
5849: our eyes). Transgression of the law, would, no doubt, be avoided; what
5850: is commanded would be done; but the mental disposition, from which
5851: actions ought to proceed, cannot be infused by any command, and in
5852: this case the spur of action is ever active and external, so that
5853: reason has no need to exert itself in order to gather strength to
5854: resist the inclinations by a lively representation of the dignity of
5855: the law: hence most of the actions that conformed to the law would
5856: be done from fear, a few only from hope, and none at all from duty,
5857: and the moral worth of actions, on which alone in the eyes of
5858: supreme wisdom the worth of the person and even that of the world
5859: depends, would cease to exist. As long as the nature of man remains
5860: what it is, his conduct would thus be changed into mere mechanism,
5861: in which, as in a puppet-show, everything would gesticulate well,
5862: but there would be no life in the figures. Now, when it is quite
5863: otherwise with us, when with all the effort of our reason we have only
5864: a very obscure and doubtful view into the future, when the Governor of
5865: the world allows us only to conjecture his existence and his
5866: majesty, not to behold them or prove them clearly; and on the other
5867: hand, the moral law within us, without promising or threatening
5868: anything with certainty, demands of us disinterested respect; and only
5869: when this respect has become active and dominant, does it allow us
5870: by means of it a prospect into the world of the supersensible, and
5871: then only with weak glances: all this being so, there is room for true
5872: moral disposition, immediately devoted to the law, and a rational
5873: creature can become worthy of sharing in the summum bonum that
5874: corresponds to the worth of his person and not merely to his
5875: actions. Thus what the study of nature and of man teaches us
5876: sufficiently elsewhere may well be true here also; that the
5877: unsearchable wisdom by which we exist is not less worthy of admiration
5878: in what it has denied than in what it has granted.

5885: 
5886:         Methodology of Pure Practical Reason.
5887: 
5888: 
5889: 
5890: By the methodology of pure practical reason we are not to understand
5891: the mode of proceeding with pure practical principles (whether in
5892: study or in exposition), with a view to a scientific knowledge of
5893: them, which alone is what is properly called method elsewhere in
5894: theoretical philosophy (for popular knowledge requires a manner,
5895: science a method, i.e., a process according to principles of reason by
5896: which alone the manifold of any branch of knowledge can become a
5897: system). On the contrary, by this methodology is understood the mode
5898: in which we can give the laws of pure practical reason access to the
5899: human mind and influence on its maxims, that is, by which we can
5900: make the objectively practical reason subjectively practical also.
5901: 
5902: Now it is clear enough that those determining principles of the will
5903: which alone make maxims properly moral and give them a moral worth,
5904: namely, the direct conception of the law and the objective necessity
5905: of obeying it as our duty, must be regarded as the proper springs of
5906: actions, since otherwise legality of actions might be produced, but
5907: not morality of character. But it is not so clear; on the contrary, it
5908: must at first sight seem to every one very improbable that even
5909: subjectively that exhibition of pure virtue can have more power over
5910: the human mind, and supply a far stronger spring even for effecting
5911: that legality of actions, and can produce more powerful resolutions to
5912: prefer the law, from pure respect for it, to every other
5913: consideration, than all the deceptive allurements of pleasure or of
5914: all that may be reckoned as happiness, or even than all threatenings
5915: of pain and misfortune. Nevertheless, this is actually the case, and
5916: if human nature were not so constituted, no mode of presenting the law
5917: by roundabout ways and indirect recommendations would ever produce
5918: morality of character. All would be simple hypocrisy; the law would be
5919: hated, or at least despised, while it was followed for the sake of
5920: one's own advantage. The letter of the law (legality) would be found
5921: in our actions, but not the spirit of it in our minds (morality);
5922: and as with all our efforts we could not quite free ourselves from
5923: reason in our judgement, we must inevitably appear in our own eyes
5924: worthless, depraved men, even though we should seek to compensate
5925: ourselves for this mortification before the inner tribunal, by
5926: enjoying the pleasure that a supposed natural or divine law might be
5927: imagined to have connected with it a sort of police machinery,
5928: regulating its operations by what was done without troubling itself
5929: about the motives for doing it.
5930: 
5931: It cannot indeed be denied that in order to bring an uncultivated or
5932: degraded mind into the track of moral goodness some preparatory
5933: guidance is necessary, to attract it by a view of its own advantage,
5934: or to alarm it by fear of loss; but as soon as this mechanical work,
5935: these leading-strings have produced some effect, then we must bring
5936: before the mind the pure moral motive, which, not only because it is
5937: the only one that can be the foundation of a character (a
5938: practically consistent habit of mind with unchangeable maxims), but
5939: also because it teaches a man to feel his own dignity, gives the
5940: mind a power unexpected even by himself, to tear himself from all
5941: sensible attachments so far as they would fain have the rule, and to
5942: find a rich compensation for the sacrifice he offers, in the
5943: independence of his rational nature and the greatness of soul to which
5944: he sees that he is destined. We will therefore show, by such
5945: observations as every one can make, that this property of our minds,
5946: this receptivity for a pure moral interest, and consequently the
5947: moving force of the pure conception of virtue, when it is properly
5948: applied to the human heart, is the most powerful spring and, when a
5949: continued and punctual observance of moral maxims is in question,
5950: the only spring of good conduct. It must, however, be remembered
5951: that if these observations only prove the reality of such a feeling,
5952: but do not show any moral improvement brought about by it, this is
5953: no argument against the only method that exists of making the
5954: objectively practical laws of pure reason subjectively practical,
5955: through the mere force of the conception of duty; nor does it prove
5956: that this method is a vain delusion. For as it has never yet come into
5957: vogue, experience can say nothing of its results; one can only ask for
5958: proofs of the receptivity for such springs, and these I will now
5959: briefly present, and then sketch the method of founding and
5960: cultivating genuine moral dispositions.

5963: 
5964: When we attend to the course of conversation in mixed companies,
5965: consisting not merely of learned persons and subtle reasoners, but
5966: also of men of business or of women, we observe that, besides
5967: story-telling and jesting, another kind of entertainment finds a place
5968: in them, namely, argument; for stories, if they are to have novelty
5969: and interest, are soon exhausted, and jesting is likely to become
5970: insipid. Now of all argument there is none in which persons are more
5971: ready to join who find any other subtle discussion tedious, none
5972: that brings more liveliness into the company, than that which concerns
5973: the moral worth of this or that action by which the character of
5974: some person is to be made out. Persons, to whom in other cases
5975: anything subtle and speculative in theoretical questions is dry and
5976: irksome, presently join in when the question is to make out the
5977: moral import of a good or bad action that has been related, and they
5978: display an exactness, a refinement, a subtlety, in excogitating
5979: everything that can lessen the purity of purpose, and consequently the
5980: degree of virtue in it, which we do not expect from them in any
5981: other kind of speculation. In these criticisms, persons who are
5982: passing judgement on others often reveal their own character: some, in
5983: exercising their judicial office, especially upon the dead, seem
5984: inclined chiefly to defend the goodness that is related of this or
5985: that deed against all injurious charges of insincerity, and ultimately
5986: to defend the whole moral worth of the person against the reproach
5987: of dissimulation and secret wickedness; others, on the contrary,
5988: turn their thoughts more upon attacking this worth by accusation and
5989: fault finding. We cannot always, however, attribute to these latter
5990: the intention of arguing away virtue altogether out of all human
5991: examples in order to make it an empty name; often, on the contrary, it
5992: is only well-meant strictness in determining the true moral import
5993: of actions according to an uncompromising law. Comparison with such
5994: a law, instead of with examples, lowers self-conceit in moral
5995: matters very much, and not merely teaches humility, but makes every
5996: one feel it when he examines himself closely. Nevertheless, we can for
5997: the most part observe, in those who defend the purity of purpose in
5998: giving examples that where there is the presumption of uprightness
5999: they are anxious to remove even the least spot, lest, if all
6000: examples had their truthfulness disputed, and if the purity of all
6001: human virtue were denied, it might in the end be regarded as a mere
6002: phantom, and so all effort to attain it be made light of as vain
6003: affectation and delusive conceit.
6004: 
6005: I do not know why the educators of youth have not long since made
6006: use of this propensity of reason to enter with pleasure upon the
6007: most subtle examination of the practical questions that are thrown up;
6008: and why they have not, after first laying the foundation of a purely
6009: moral catechism, searched through the biographies of ancient and
6010: modern times with the view of having at hand instances of the duties
6011: laid down, in which, especially by comparison of similar actions under
6012: different circumstances, they might exercise the critical judgement of
6013: their scholars in remarking their greater or less moral
6014: significance. This is a thing in which they would find that even early
6015: youth, which is still unripe for speculation of other kinds, would
6016: soon Become very acute and not a little interested, because it feels
6017: the progress of its faculty of judgement; and, what is most important,
6018: they could hope with confidence that the frequent practice of
6019: knowing and approving good conduct in all its purity, and on the other
6020: hand of remarking with regret or contempt the least deviation from it,
6021: although it may be pursued only as a sport in which children may
6022: compete with one another, yet will leave a lasting impression of
6023: esteem on the one hand and disgust on the other; and so, by the mere
6024: habit of looking on such actions as deserving approval or blame, a
6025: good foundation would be laid for uprightness in the future course
6026: of life. Only I wish they would spare them the example of so-called
6027: noble (super-meritorious) actions, in which our sentimental books so
6028: much abound, and would refer all to duty merely, and to the worth that
6029: a man can and must give himself in his own eyes by the consciousness
6030: of not having transgressed it, since whatever runs up into empty
6031: wishes and longings after inaccessible perfection produces mere heroes
6032: of romance, who, while they pique themselves on their feeling for
6033: transcendent greatness, release themselves in return from the
6034: observance of common and every-day obligations, which then seem to
6035: them petty and insignificant. *
6036: 
6037: 
6038: 
6039: * It is quite proper to extol actions that display a great,
6040: unselfish, sympathizing mind or humanity. But, in this case, we must
6041: fix attention not so much on the elevation of soul, which is very
6042: fleeting and transitory, as on the subjection of the heart to duty,
6043: from which a more enduring impression may be expected, because this
6044: implies principle (whereas the former only implies ebullitions). One
6045: need only reflect a little and he will always find a debt that he
6046: has by some means incurred towards the human race (even if it were
6047: only this, by the inequality of men in the civil constitution,
6048: enjoys advantages on account of which others must be the more in
6049: want), which will prevent the thought of duty from being repressed
6050: by the self-complacent imagination of merit.

6055: 
6056: But if it is asked: "What, then, is really pure morality, by which
6057: as a touchstone we must test the moral significance of every
6058: action," then I must admit that it is only philosophers that can
6059: make the decision of this question doubtful, for to common sense it
6060: has been decided long ago, not indeed by abstract general formulae,
6061: but by habitual use, like the distinction between the right and left
6062: hand. We will then point out the criterion of pure virtue in an
6063: example first, and, imagining that it is set before a boy, of say
6064: ten years old, for his judgement, we will see whether he would
6065: necessarily judge so of himself without being guided by his teacher.
6066: Tell him the history of an honest man whom men want to persuade to
6067: join the calumniators of an innocent and powerless person (say Anne
6068: Boleyn, accused by Henry VIII of England). He is offered advantages,
6069: great gifts, or high rank; he rejects them. This will excite mere
6070: approbation and applause in the mind of the hearer. Now begins the
6071: threatening of loss. Amongst these traducers are his best friends, who
6072: now renounce his friendship; near kinsfolk, who threaten to disinherit
6073: him (he being without fortune); powerful persons, who can persecute
6074: and harass him in all places and circumstances; a prince, who
6075: threatens him with loss of freedom, yea, loss of life. Then to fill
6076: the measure of suffering, and that he may feel the pain that only
6077: the morally good heart can feel very deeply, let us conceive his
6078: family threatened with extreme distress and want, entreating him to
6079: yield; conceive himself, though upright, yet with feelings not hard or
6080: insensible either to compassion or to his own distress; conceive
6081: him, I say, at the moment when he wishes that he had never lived to
6082: see the day that exposed him to such unutterable anguish, yet
6083: remaining true to his uprightness of purpose, without wavering or even
6084: doubting; then will my youthful hearer be raised gradually from mere
6085: approval to admiration, from that to amazement, and finally to the
6086: greatest veneration, and a lively wish that he himself could be such a
6087: man (though certainly not in such circumstances). Yet virtue is here
6088: worth so much only because it costs so much, not because it brings any
6089: profit. All the admiration, and even the endeavour to resemble this
6090: character, rest wholly on the purity of the moral principle, which can
6091: only be strikingly shown by removing from the springs of action
6092: everything that men may regard as part of happiness. Morality, then,
6093: must have the more power over the human heart the more purely it is
6094: exhibited. Whence it follows that, if the law of morality and the
6095: image of holiness and virtue are to exercise any influence at all on
6096: our souls, they can do so only so far as they are laid to heart in
6097: their purity as motives, unmixed with any view to prosperity, for it
6098: is in suffering that they display themselves most nobly. Now that
6099: whose removal strengthens the effect of a moving force must have
6100: been a hindrance, consequently every admixture of motives taken from
6101: our own happiness is a hindrance to the influence of the moral law
6102: on the heart. I affirm further that even in that admired action, if
6103: the motive from which it was done was a high regard for duty, then
6104: it is just this respect for the law that has the greatest influence on
6105: the mind of the spectator, not any pretension to a supposed inward
6106: greatness of mind or noble meritorious sentiments; consequently
6107: duty, not merit, must have not only the most definite, but, when it is
6108: represented in the true light of its inviolability, the most
6109: penetrating, influence on the mind.
6110: 
6111: It is more necessary than ever to direct attention to this method in
6112: our times, when men hope to produce more effect on the mind with soft,
6113: tender feelings, or high-flown, puffing-up pretensions, which rather
6114: wither the heart than strengthen it, than by a plain and earnest
6115: representation of duty, which is more suited to human imperfection and
6116: to progress in goodness. To set before children, as a pattern, actions
6117: that are called noble, magnanimous, meritorious, with the notion of
6118: captivating them by infusing enthusiasm for such actions, is to defeat
6119: our end. For as they are still so backward in the observance of the
6120: commonest duty, and even in the correct estimation of it, this means
6121: simply to make them fantastical romancers betimes. But, even with
6122: the instructed and experienced part of mankind, this supposed spring
6123: has, if not an injurious, at least no genuine, moral effect on the
6124: heart, which, however, is what it was desired to produce.
6125: 
6126: All feelings, especially those that are to produce unwonted
6127: exertions, must accomplish their effect at the moment they are at
6128: their height and before the calm down; otherwise they effect
6129: nothing; for as there was nothing to strengthen the heart, but only to
6130: excite it, it naturally returns to its normal moderate tone and, thus,
6131: falls back into its previous languor. Principles must be built on
6132: conceptions; on any other basis there can only be paroxysms, which can
6133: give the person no moral worth, nay, not even confidence in himself,
6134: without which the highest good in man, consciousness of the morality
6135: of his mind and character, cannot exist. Now if these conceptions
6136: are to become subjectively practical, we must not rest satisfied
6137: with admiring the objective law of morality, and esteeming it highly
6138: in reference to humanity, but we must consider the conception of it in
6139: relation to man as an individual, and then this law appears in a
6140: form indeed that is highly deserving of respect, but not so pleasant
6141: as if it belonged to the element to which he is naturally
6142: accustomed; but on the contrary as often compelling him to quit this
6143: element, not without self-denial, and to betake himself to a higher,
6144: in which he can only maintain himself with trouble and with
6145: unceasing apprehension of a relapse. In a word, the moral law
6146: demands obedience, from duty not from predilection, which cannot and
6147: ought not to be presupposed at all.
6148: 
6149: Let us now see, in an example, whether the conception of an
6150: action, as a noble and magnanimous one, has more subjective moving
6151: power than if the action is conceived merely as duty in relation to
6152: the solemn law of morality. The action by which a man endeavours at
6153: the greatest peril of life to rescue people from shipwreck, at last
6154: losing his life in the attempt, is reckoned on one side as duty, but
6155: on the other and for the most part as a meritorious action, but our
6156: esteem for it is much weakened by the notion of duty to himself
6157: which seems in this case to be somewhat infringed. More decisive is
6158: the magnanimous sacrifice of life for the safety of one's country; and
6159: yet there still remains some scruple whether it is a perfect duty to
6160: devote one's self to this purpose spontaneously and unbidden, and
6161: the action has not in itself the full force of a pattern and impulse
6162: to imitation. But if an indispensable duty be in question, the
6163: transgression of which violates the moral law itself, and without
6164: regard to the welfare of mankind, and as it were tramples on its
6165: holiness (such as are usually called duties to God, because in Him
6166: we conceive the ideal of holiness in substance), then we give our most
6167: perfect esteem to the pursuit of it at the sacrifice of all that can
6168: have any value for the dearest inclinations, and we find our soul
6169: strengthened and elevated by such an example, when we convince
6170: ourselves by contemplation of it that human nature is capable of so
6171: great an elevation above every motive that nature can oppose to it.
6172: Juvenal describes such an example in a climax which makes the reader
6173: feel vividly the force of the spring that is contained in the pure law
6174: of duty, as duty:

6205: When we can bring any flattering thought of merit into our action,

6208: postpone everything to the holiness of duty alone, and to be conscious
6209: that we can because our own reason recognises this as its command
6210: and says that we ought to do it, this is, as it were, to raise

6221: The method then takes the following course. At first we are only
6222: concerned to make the judging of actions by moral laws a natural
6223: employment accompanying all our own free actions, as well as the
6224: observation of those of others, and to make it as it were a habit, and
6225: to sharpen this judgement, asking first whether the action conforms
6226: objectively to the moral law, and to what law; and we distinguish
6227: the law that merely furnishes a principle of obligation from that
6228: which is really obligatory (leges obligandi a legibus obligantibus);
6229: as, for instance, the law of what men's wants require from me, as
6230: contrasted with that which their rights demand, the latter of which
6231: prescribes essential, the former only non-essential duties; and thus
6232: we teach how to distinguish different kinds of duties which meet in
6233: the same action. The other point to which attention must be directed
6234: is the question whether the action was also (subjectively) done for
6235: the sake of the moral law, so that it not only is morally correct as a
6236: deed, but also, by the maxim from which it is done, has moral worth as
6237: a disposition. Now there is no doubt that this practice, and the
6238: resulting culture of our reason in judging merely of the practical,
6239: must gradually produce a certain interest even in the law of reason,
6240: and consequently in morally good actions. For we ultimately take a
6241: liking for a thing, the contemplation of which makes us feel that
6242: the use of our cognitive faculties is extended; and this extension
6243: is especially furthered by that in which we find moral correctness,
6244: since it is only in such an order of things that reason, with its
6245: faculty of determining a priori on principle what ought to be done,
6246: can find satisfaction. An observer of nature takes liking at last to
6247: objects that at first offended his senses, when he discovers in them
6248: the great adaptation of their organization to design, so that his
6249: reason finds food in its contemplation. So Leibnitz spared an insect
6250: that he had carefully examined with the microscope, and replaced it on
6251: its leaf, because he had found himself instructed by the view of it
6252: and had, as it were, received a benefit from it.
6253: 
6254: But this employment of the faculty of judgement, which makes us feel
6255: our own cognitive powers, is not yet the interest in actions and in
6256: their morality itself. It merely causes us to take pleasure in
6257: engaging in such criticism, and it gives to virtue or the
6258: disposition that conforms to moral laws a form of beauty, which is
6259: admired, but not on that account sought after (laudatur et alget);
6260: as everything the contemplation of which produces a consciousness of
6261: the harmony of our powers of conception, and in which we feel the
6262: whole of our faculty of knowledge (understanding and imagination)
6263: strengthened, produces a satisfaction, which may also be
6264: communicated to others, while nevertheless the existence of the object
6265: remains indifferent to us, being only regarded as the occasion of
6266: our becoming aware of the capacities in us which are elevated above
6267: mere animal nature. Now, however, the second exercise comes in, the
6268: living exhibition of morality of character by examples, in which
6269: attention is directed to purity of will, first only as a negative
6270: perfection, in so far as in an action done from duty no motives of
6271: inclination have any influence in determining it. By this the
6272: pupil's attention is fixed upon the consciousness of his freedom,
6273: and although this renunciation at first excites a feeling of pain,
6274: nevertheless, by its withdrawing the pupil from the constraint of even
6275: real wants, there is proclaimed to him at the same time a
6276: deliverance from the manifold dissatisfaction in which all these wants
6277: entangle him, and the mind is made capable of receiving the
6278: sensation of satisfaction from other sources. The heart is freed and
6279: lightened of a burden that always secretly presses on it, when
6280: instances of pure moral resolutions reveal to the man an inner faculty
6281: of which otherwise he has no right knowledge, the inward freedom to
6282: release himself from the boisterous importunity of inclinations, to
6283: such a degree that none of them, not even the dearest, shall have
6284: any influence on a resolution, for which we are now to employ our
6285: reason. Suppose a case where I alone know that the wrong is on my
6286: side, and although a free confession of it and the offer of
6287: satisfaction are so strongly opposed by vanity, selfishness, and
6288: even an otherwise not illegitimate antipathy to the man whose rights
6289: are impaired by me, I am nevertheless able to discard all these
6290: considerations; in this there is implied a consciousness of
6291: independence on inclinations and circumstances, and of the possibility
6292: of being sufficient for myself, which is salutary to me in general for
6293: other purposes also. And now the law of duty, in consequence of the
6294: positive worth which obedience to it makes us feel, finds easier
6295: access through the respect for ourselves in the consciousness of our
6296: freedom. When this is well established, when a man dreads nothing more
6297: than to find himself, on self-examination, worthless and
6298: contemptible in his own eyes, then every good moral disposition can be
6299: grafted on it, because this is the best, nay, the only guard that
6300: can keep off from the mind the pressure of ignoble and corrupting
6301: motives.
6302: 
6303: I have only intended to point out the most general maxims of the
6304: methodology of moral cultivation and exercise. As the manifold variety
6305: of duties requires special rules for each kind, and this would be a
6306: prolix affair, I shall be readily excused if in a work like this,
6307: which is only preliminary, I content myself with these outlines.
6308: 
6309: PART_2|CONCLUSION
6310: 
6311:                      CONCLUSION.
6312: 
6313: 
6314: 
6315: Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and
6316: awe, the oftener and the more steadily we reflect on them: the
6317: starry heavens above and the moral law within. I have not to search
6318: for them and conjecture them as though they were veiled in darkness or
6319: were in the transcendent region beyond my horizon; I see them before
6320: me and connect them directly with the consciousness of my existence.
6321: The former begins from the place I occupy in the external world of
6322: sense, and enlarges my connection therein to an unbounded extent
6323: with worlds upon worlds and systems of systems, and moreover into
6324: limitless times of their periodic motion, its beginning and
6325: continuance. The second begins from my invisible self, my personality,
6326: and exhibits me in a world which has true infinity, but which is
6327: traceable only by the understanding, and with which I discern that I
6328: am not in a merely contingent but in a universal and necessary
6329: connection, as I am also thereby with all those visible worlds. The
6330: former view of a countless multitude of worlds annihilates as it
6331: were my importance as an animal creature, which after it has been
6332: for a short time provided with vital power, one knows not how, must
6333: again give back the matter of which it was formed to the planet it
6334: inhabits (a mere speck in the universe). The second, on the
6335: contrary, infinitely elevates my worth as an intelligence by my
6336: personality, in which the moral law reveals to me a life independent
6337: of animality and even of the whole sensible world, at least so far
6338: as may be inferred from the destination assigned to my existence by
6339: this law, a destination not restricted to conditions and limits of
6340: this life, but reaching into the infinite.
6341: 
6342: But though admiration and respect may excite to inquiry, they cannot
6343: supply the want of it. What, then, is to be done in order to enter
6344: on this in a useful manner and one adapted to the loftiness of the
6345: subject? Examples may serve in this as a warning and also for
6346: imitation. The contemplation of the world began from the noblest
6347: spectacle that the human senses present to us, and that our
6348: understanding can bear to follow in their vast reach; and it ended- in
6349: astrology. Morality began with the noblest attribute of human
6350: nature, the development and cultivation of which give a prospect of
6351: infinite utility; and ended- in fanaticism or superstition. So it is
6352: with all crude attempts where the principal part of the business
6353: depends on the use of reason, a use which does not come of itself,
6354: like the use of the feet, by frequent exercise, especially when
6355: attributes are in question which cannot be directly exhibited in
6356: common experience. But after the maxim had come into vogue, though
6357: late, to examine carefully beforehand all the steps that reason
6358: purposes to take, and not to let it proceed otherwise than in the
6359: track of a previously well considered method, then the study of the
6360: structure of the universe took quite a different direction, and
6361: thereby attained an incomparably happier result. The fall of a
6362: stone, the motion of a sling, resolved into their elements and the
6363: forces that are manifested in them, and treated mathematically,
6364: produced at last that clear and henceforward unchangeable insight into
6365: the system of the world which, as observation is continued, may hope
6366: always to extend itself, but need never fear to be compelled to
6367: retreat.
6368: 
6369: This example may suggest to us to enter on the same path in treating
6370: of the moral capacities of our nature, and may give us hope of a
6371: like good result. We have at hand the instances of the moral judgement
6372: of reason. By analysing these into their elementary conceptions, and
6373: in default of mathematics adopting a process similar to that of
6374: chemistry, the separation of the empirical from the rational
6375: elements that may be found in them, by repeated experiments on
6376: common sense, we may exhibit both pure, and learn with certainty
6377: what each part can accomplish of itself, so as to prevent on the one
6378: hand the errors of a still crude untrained judgement, and on the other
6379: hand (what is far more necessary) the extravagances of genius, by
6380: which, as by the adepts of the philosopher's stone, without any
6381: methodical study or knowledge of nature, visionary treasures are
6382: promised and the true are thrown away. In one word, science
6383: (critically undertaken and methodically directed) is the narrow gate
6384: that leads to the true doctrine of practical wisdom, if we
6385: understand by this not merely what one ought to do, but what ought
6386: to serve teachers as a guide to construct well and clearly the road to
6387: wisdom which everyone should travel, and to secure others from going
6388: astray. Philosophy must always continue to be the guardian of this
6389: science; and although the public does not take any interest in its
6390: subtle investigations, it must take an interest in the resulting
6391: doctrines, which such an examination first puts in a clear light.
